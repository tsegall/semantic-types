Andrews has proposed to create aluminum security screens for the window openings, with colored glass and optical lenses inserted into the screen. The glass will cast colored shadows and the lenses will reflect images of passers-by on the interior walls. The proposal works on two levels: On a practical level, the grid structure makes the large window openings safe and protects the stairway from wind and rain, without enclosing it with solid glass. And on an aesthetic level, this practical solution provides visual interest and improves the look of the building where it is most visible."

To create the sculptures the artist researched the heritage and flavor of East Cambridge flower and vegetable gardens. The sculptures are set amid the surrounding plant life and vegetation. One sculpture depicts Sunflowers intertwined with Grapevines sprouting from the base, which the artist sees as a floral fountain -- an explosion of the life force and energy of this community. The other work depicts the Poppy, Daylily and Lily-of-the-Valley.

Gerakaris specializes in site-specific sculptural and architectural metalwork utilizing primarily forged metals.

Just as the song celebrates ""the love between my sisters and my brothers, all over this land"" the artwork presents scenes of cross-cultural understanding. Children and adults from different backgrounds fly kites, make music, shoot basketball, admire butterflies and birds, climb and play on the structure, and share stories. Inglese's signature style borrows from the tradition of stained glass: irregular clay shapes form images, which, in turn, are outlined by grout, much like the way lead surrounds stained glass.
A Massachusetts resident, Inglese studied at Sarah Lawrence College, at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, and at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. She has received several grants for community based art workshops in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. Her other public works include a 40 foot ceramic mural at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. and pieces for numerous schools, recreational facilities, hospitals, transportation centers, libraries, and elderly housing.

Narrowing a wide intersection resulted in the creation of a small plaza with trees, which in turn became the canvas for well-known local painter, Jane Goldman.

Goldman's goal for her piece in newly constructed Sheridan Square was to create a serene ""New England oasis in an urban environment."" Using the unexpected but durable and affordable medium of yellow, black, red, and white construction pavers, she designed patterns around the square's five tree pits. The arrangements are derived from traditional quilt patterns, summoning up associations of comfort and warmth, as well as paying tribute to one of America's most enduring homespun artforms.

Educated at Smith College and the University of Wisconsin, where she received her M.F.A., Goldman is a prolific and versatile artist. Her works, executed in watercolor, oil, intaglio, lithography, relief, screenprint, and terrazzo, have been exhibited widely in the U.S. and Europe, and are part of the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Cleveland Museum, and Library of Congress, among others. Local travelers may be familiar with Goldman's aquatic-themed terrazzo walkways at Logan International Airport. She is a resident of Somerville, MA.

The artists have placed a great emphasis on making the area inviting and safe. The dense canopy of Locust trees will be thinned to let sunlight in and special lights will be suspended from cables over the space to provide evenly diffused lighting without lurking shadows. Three 18"" high granite planters will be placed in asymmetrical formation, with wood platforms on top for seating. A variety of plants, including a series of white Birches, will reflect the strong tradition of gardening in the neighborhood, while also providing barriers from the loud traffic on both sides of the plaza. A gridded wall along the back will provide a barrier for the direct abutters. The scale of the open spaces between the planters has been determined to encourage groups to assemble for meetings and performances.

Her choice of materials and sculptural forms reference the past and present uses of the Park. The shelter sits on the edge of a small body of water (""Jerry's Pit"") that once was a clay pit for the local nineteenth-century brickmaking industry. Later it became a swimming hole and eventually an industrial site and environmental blemish.

Davis's rose-tinted glass panels forming the walls of the bus shelter make a reference to our desire to see beauty where there is blight. Rose-colored panes are punctuated by clear panels, and as one moves in and out of the structure, our view of our surroundings, through carefully callibrated spaces, makes subtle shifts. The wood bench extends beyond the perimeter of the shelter, evoking the length of a baseball dugout and the activity of waiting, shared by baseball player and bus rider alike. The shelter has extra height and encourages an upward glance, where the rose of the glass, the blue of the sky, and the tips of the nearby trees share one's frame of vision.

Fichter shows Parks telling her story to a group of school-children, whose diverse ethnicities not only reflect Cambridge's multi-cultural makeup but also embody the spirit of the Civil Rights Movement. Park's struggle for equal rights everywhere is represented by two opposing images: the chains of oppression and interlinked hands demonstrating the power of unity and resistance.
Fichter is a resident of Cambridge and has painted murals in the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States, as well as in Nicaragua and in the former Soviet countries of Russia, Georgia and Armenia. Several of his works are located in other public spaces around Cambridge."

The four Colonial soldiers are scattered throughout the park, in stances of battle readiness, while the Victorian figure sits alone pondering the historical site.
After the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the British retreated to Boston. George Washington encircled the city with fortifications, of which this is one. At that time, the fort overlooked the Charles River, and the cannons pointed towards Boston. The area was made into a park in 1857 when the land was donated to the City and the cast-iron fence surrounding the park was erected.

His East Cambridge-1852 is a narrative work celebrating the furniture-making and glass-blowing industries which flourished in East Cambridge during the 19th century. Located on 10 and 12-foot columns at the pedestrian entrance to the garage, the sculpture is constructed of mild steel that is forged and painted in high-gloss epoxy colors. From left to right, the work depicts: a brickworker's home with smoke from the hearthfire blowing out of the chimney; a glass-blower and his helper; the two main kiln buildings of the Boston Porcelain and Glassworks, with a worker in-between and black smoke wafting from the elevated industrial chimneys; the proud president of the company with a finished product in his hands; three workers' row houses; two chairs; three furniture makers; and Geldowsky's Furniture Company. A well-dressed Cambridge couple from that era and another worker's house complete the piece.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, George received his BFA in Dimensional Design from the Philadelphia Museum College and an MFA in sculpture from the University of Kansas. He taught as a Professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and worked as chair of the sculpture department for many years. He has been awarded commissions in nearly all states through ""one percent"" programs.

The design juxtaposes symbols of the U.S.A., Haiti, China, India, & Portugal, countries representing Cambridge’s most recent immigrant populations, with references to the Charles River and surrounding location.

There was a tremendous outpouring of money, condolences and support from the local community and friends of the family in the months following his passing. At the base of the granite pedestal which ""DooDoo"" (Igor's favorite puppet) sits on, are three bronze bricks with a memorial inscription. The plaque not only memorializes Igor, but pays tribute to all street performers. The location of the memorial is on the corner of One Brattle Square, where Igor worked most often and performed his final show. It was designed so as to not interfere or make it difficult for other performers to use the spot for future shows.

A graduate of the St. Petersburg Theatrical Institute in Russia, Fokin moved to Cambridge, MA in the summer of 1993 and was instantly surrounded by mesmerized admirers. Children and adults were captivated by the intricate, gentle and life-like character of his creations. By the end of the summer, he had established himself as one of the most popular acts in the Boston area. In the summer of 1996, he performed at the Olympic festivities in Atlanta.

Konstantin Simun was born in Leningrad, USSR in 1934 and has lived with his family in the Boston area since 1988. He has a degree in sculpture from the Repin Art Institute in Leningrad and has completed several large and small public art commisions. His work is part of the permanent collections of many of the largest museums in Russia."

The result is a three times life-size portrait of all members of Engine Company No. 5 in firefighting gear, along with the company dalmatian, posed around one of their pump trucks. Also included in the scene are two volunteer firemen straight out of history. Benjamin Franklin, who founded the first volunteer fire department in the country, stands on the running board in a pair of red sneakers.

A form borrowed directly from nature, the graceful curve of the spiral has been admired throughout the ages for its simple elegance and has served as basis for ornament in many cultures. Reflecting the intimate connection between form and function, art and life, the spiral is a common motif in David Phillips' art.
David Phillips is well known for his public sculpture and his collaborations with landscape architects. His work often explores the resilience of nature, incorporating organic elements, such as stones and trees, with cast materials."

Consisting of an aerial view of Cambridge and its enivirons, from the Mystic River to Walden Pond, the map shows the entire reservoir system and associated watershed. Using topographical maps and high altitude infrared photographs from NASA as source material, she added, in painstaking detail, all of the streets and buildings in Cambridge, as well as the streams and lakes which form the city's water system. The mural's dominant colors are green, blue, and tan, with two stark lines, one red and one blue, which represent the water supply conduits. The areas within the borders of the watershed are painted in higher contrast and with more saturated color than the surrounding areas, which are more loosely painted in softer colors.

Turre studied at Sonoma State University and at the University of Iowa. She has exhibited widely in Massachusetts, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, New York, and Connecticut.

They kick soccer balls, shoot basketballs, collect starfish, cuddle a cat, create chalk drawings on the street, or simply interact with one another. The tree that stretches across the scene hints at the work's simple yet powerful main message: children ""branch out"" when they play. They learn about their environment, themselves, and others. They grow and develop. In the words of the title, ""play is children's work."""

Adding to the mystery are an open drawer and the pink glow from a hidden electric light. In designing this fairy-tale sculpture, Harries chose to work in wood, as opposed to cheaper materials like plastic, and had the piece crafted by a cabinetmaker using traditional techniques. Harries then covered the desk in six coats of different colored paint - providing an element of surprised delight when students scratch their initials into the ""magic desk.""
Harries's public art projects range from indoor installations like Gateway to large-scale outdoor structures that grace museums, parks, and institutions around the U.S. and Great Britain. Many of these works can be found in the Boston/Cambridge area, the most familiar being the Asaroton '76 cross walk at Haymarket and Glove Cycle at the Porter Square MBTA subway station.

In Conley's words, maps historically represented ""influence, trade, knowledge, and power."" This mural certainly encourages knowledge - it's located on the west wall of the school library and can be used as a teaching tool. It also celebrates the international character of the school. At the time of Conley's commission, Longfellow School's student body represented 43 different countries. Made with the Renaissance-era technique of fresco painting, this map, says Conley, ""is intended to remind us of the changing world we all belong to.""
Conley first encountered map rooms in the early 1980s, when he traveled to Italy on a Fulbright scholarship. Although he is one of the few artists still practicing the art of fresco painting, he now concentrates on the ""more portable"" medium of oil painting. Conley has exhibited in solo and group shows around the country and his work is in several museums and corporate collections. Educated at the Pratt Institute, the Boston Museum School, and Tufts University, he serves as an adjunct professor in Fine Arts at Boston College and is curator for Boston College's McMullen Museum of Art."

In accordance with the city's Public Art Ordinance, the Cambridge Arts Council commissioned artist Toshihiro Katayama to develop public art for the new plaza as the centerpiece of Porter Square. Katayama worked with landscape architect Cynthia Smith, members of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee, and city staff to develop a bold design for the plaza. The goals of his design were to create a visual identity for the Square, integrate both sides of Massachusetts Avenue, unify the three parts of the plaza visually, and reduce the visual clutter of the busy intersection through simplification and clarity. Natural materials include stonewalls, Cape Ann granite boulders, and new trees and shrubs. Concrete pavers in light and dark grey create a pattern that addresses the entire width of the plaza in one visual sweep.

The front of the desk is decorated with a carved panel that depicts neighborhood buildings, including St. Peter's Church and the Harvard Observatory. A prime example of art-furniture, the desk helps shape the character of the library, while serving both decorative and functional purposes.

Ryerson says that furniture appeals to him because the viewer can interact with it. His work invites a connection that is often hard to obtain with other fine arts, such as sculpture. He feels the intimacy and casualness of his work make it less intimidating to people. ""I want people to be able to approach my work,"" he says. ""My artwork isn't about heavy existential crises - it's about feeling good, about experiencing pleasure.""

Ryerson has operated Ryerson Studios located in Cambridge for many years, making custom furniture sold through galleries and on a commission basis. Originally a boat builder in Maine, he shifted into furniture because, as he says, it gave him a ""freedom of expression."" In 1998 he received the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts artist award. The society is the oldest nonprofit craft organization in America and awarded Ryerson the prize for ""showing mastery in his medium by creating original and creative contemporary crafts.""

""I work with glass so that it will reflect nature and be alive to light, constantly changing like all things in nature,"" Lichtman says. ""I tear away the surface of the glass with hydrofluoric acid or build up layers of paints, transparent enamels, and silver stain to increase richness and density."" From this hazardous process emerges the most delicate of designs. Lichtman explains that each specific piece of glass etches differently. The result is the abstract imagery in ""Landscape Frieze in Glass,"" which illumines the large window in the Cambridge Senior Center, as though the glass itself contained the light.

Lichtman earned her BFA in painting from Massachusetts College of Art in 1974. She studied with a master glass artist Patrick Reyntiens at Burleighfiled House in England and apprenticed to other glass artists in the U.K., Canada and Germany before continuing studies at the Museum School in Boston. Lichtman has lived and worked in Cambridge since 1978."

William Wainwright deserves to be called a 20th century ""renaissance artist,"" applying his professional training in both architecture and engineering to create complex and innovative mobile sculptures. Besides his creative contribution to art, he holds two U.S. patents. Wainwright studied at Purdue University, Cornell, the Institute of Design in Chicago, and M.I.T.

The other side of the sculpture is rough-hewn stone, a showcase for the granite that Dorrien selected for its texture and shading. On this same side are three steps, also suggesting that the piece is a ruin, which the sculptor painstakingly cut into the stone, using a time-honored method.

Dorrien states that his ""work is a marriage of many influences."" In ""Quiet Cornerstone"", he has utilized stonecutting, an ancient tradition, whereas the right angled cornice and lettering speak more to Western European tradition. He believes that the passion an artist has for his material is translated in his work. ""Even with a public piece one wants to make beautiful objects, to provoke questions, to make a personal statement; but finally public art is a gift to others, and if you love your medium, that magic comes through.""

Dorrien was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied at the Montserrat School of Art and the Massachusetts College of Art, and has taught at Bentley College, and the New England School of Art and presently teaches at Wellesley College. He has several public art installations in Massachusetts, and has shown widely in the Boston area.

A red cross stretches across the composition, symbolizing King's work as a Baptist minister and the blood shed during the Civil Rights Movement. Another metal element suggests the body of a bus, reminding viewers of Rosa Parks' refusal to sit at the back of a public bus in Alabama. Its yellow-orange colors also refer to schoolbuses, which have literally been the vehicles of desegregation for American public schools. Finally, Maduna's main choice of material for the biographical events - black perforated sheet metal - lends the figures a shadowy quality that softens the violence of the scenes yet doesn't diminish the work's powerful message of faith, love, and resistance.

Sculptor/painter Maduna is a lifelong resident of the Boston area. His site-specific work, which combines an interest in African art with his own expressive style, has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. Many of his public installations are located in the Cambridge and Boston area, including The Judge, a recent commission for the Roxbury District Court House. Educated at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, he has been Master Artist in Residence at Northeastern University.

As a result, the artwork may not be readily noticeable to someone casually strolling through the park, or even to someone sitting on the granite blocks that the artist so carefully placed in the space. But then, that was the intention. Levine wanted to create art that people would experience and use as part of their daily life rather than marvel at from a distance.

Edward Levine is an artist and professor in the Visual Arts Program at M.I.T. Before moving to Cambridge, Levine was dean of the School of Art at East Carolina University. In addition to his public art in Cambridge, he has done permanent work in Pusan, South Korea. Levine also served as chairman of the Visual Arts Policy Panel for the NEA and is the author of several articles an art criticism and theory."
