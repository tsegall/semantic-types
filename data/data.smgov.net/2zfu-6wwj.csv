Read why in the definitive account of the 1918 Flu Epidemic. <br /><br />Magisterial in its breadth of perspective and depth of research, The Great Influenza provides us with a precise and sobering model as we confront the current pandemic. As Barry concludes, 'The final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that...those in authority must retain the public's trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.'<br /><br />John M. Barry is the author of four previous books: Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed Amer­ica; Power Plays: Politics, Football, and Other Blood Sports; The Transformed Cell: Unlocking the Mysteries of Cancer (cowritten with Steven Rosenberg); and The Ambition and the Power: A True Story of Washington.

After conducting interviews with 57 waitresses in 38 cities and towns across the U.S., the author found these women to be satisfied with their lives and proud of their job skills and occupation. Besides presenting portraits of some of these women (in both words and photos), Taylor looks at how female servers came to dominate coffee shops and diners; at the nuts and bolts of waitressing; and at the stereotypes that the larger culture has about waitresses. Delightful, thought provoking, and generously illustrated with the author's color photographs, this book will be appreciated by any reader who has eaten at a 'real' diner.<br /><br />Candacy Taylor is an award-winning author, photographer and cultural documentarian. Her work has been featured in over 50 media outlets including the New Yorker and The Atlantic.

A confluence of circumstances, including a South American speaking tour and the eagerness of others to investigate the Amazonian headwaters, brought Teddy, aged 55 and still bold and plucky, to Brazil, then largely unmapped and unknown. When the opportunity came to change a planned route to follow the uncharted course of the ominously named River of Doubt, the former chief executive seized it eagerly. And so, with devoted son Kermit and truly intrepid Brazilian co-commander Cândido Rondon, along with a band of hardy recruits, the party plunged into the fierce, fecund jungle and its unknown dangers. (Its an exploit that standard TR biographies generally treat lightly, if at all). With heavy, useless equipment and inappropriate provisions, the Roosevelt-Rondon Expedition ventured into the luxuriant wilderness where every life form threatened. There were pit vipers, piranhas and tiny fish that attack where a man is most vulnerable. There were poisonous plants, malevolent insect swarms and native warriors, ever present and never seen Eventually Colonel Roosevelt was downed by injury and fever. He ended his journey emaciated at three-quarters of the weight he started with on the watercourse now found in atlases as the Roosevelt River.

Lovell chases the Mitford sisters (Nancy, Pamela, Diana, Unity, Jessica, and Deborah) hither and yon, from mansion to prison, from Hitlers hideaway to the top of the bestseller lists. Although there are indeed numerous family crises and catastrophes the story always rolls merrily along with little trenchant or compelling analysis of the meanings or effects of the events The much-chronicled Mitfords remain a family with astonishing histories. Diana and Unity were infatuated with fascism and charmed by Hitler (Lovell does not believe they ended up in the sack). Unity, in fact, was so alarmed when England and Germany went to war that she shot herself in the head, somehow survived, and, in Lovells words, remained childlike for the rest of her life. (Hitler, ever accommodating, paid all her medical bills and saw that she got safely to Switzerland.) Back in England, Diana, whom the government considered a security threat, sat out three and a half years of the war in prison Jessicadenied an education by her parents (who saw no point in it for young women)rebelled by becoming a Communist and later emigrated to America, where, after becoming a citizen, she found herself being grilled by the California Un-American Activities Committee.

Brooklyn girl Katey Kontent and her boardinghouse mate, Midwestern beauty Eve Ross, are expert flirts who become an instant, inseparable threesome with mysterious young banker Tinker Grey. With him, they hit all the hot nightspots and consume much alcohol. After a milk truck mauls his roadster with the women in it, permanently scarring Eve, the guilt-ridden Tinker devotes himself to her, though he and she both know he has stronger feelings for Katey. Strong-willed Katey works her way up the career ladder, from secretarial job on Wall Street to publishers assistant at Condé Nast, forging friendships with society types and not allowing social niceties to stand in her way. Eve and Tinker grow apart, and then Kate, belatedly seeing Tinker for what he is, sadly gives up on him. (from Kirkus Reviews)",Offsite or Virtual Programs,"Offsite or Virtual Programs

Western society, once thriving, is being torn apart by deep new rifts in its social and economic fabric. It's now populous cities versus rural counties; the highly skilled elite versus the less educated; wealthy versus developing countries. As these breaks have deepened, we've lost the sense of obligation to others so crucial to the rise of postwar social democracy in the first place. These divisions are currently being addressed solely by revivalist ideologies and populist megafigures--we're in the age of Brexit, President Donald Trump, and the return of the far right in Germany. And unless we do something now, the gap between the promises of prosperity for all that capitalism once offered and the crisis of contempt we find ourselves in will only grow wider, faster. [This book] is a passionate and polemical treatise that presents brilliantly original solutions for healing this economic, social, and cultural discord, with the cool head of pragmatism and policy rather than the fervor of rhetoric. Paul Collier's workable solution is in the center: we have no time for moral or intellectual superiority on either side of the political spectrum, he argues, and no shiny new economic theory is going to save us this time. Drawing on the wisdom of some of the world's most distinguished social scientists, Collier charts an agenda of empowerment to show us how to save capitalism from itself--eschewing the ideological baggage of the twentieth century and instead crafting practical policy grounded in communitarian ethics to address the rapid rise in inequality that will either end us or propel us into an entirely new economic age.",Offsite or Virtual Programs,"Offsite or Virtual Programs

The inaugural Santa Monica Farmers Market opened Wednesday July 11, 1981 in Santa Monica's downtown retail district with goals of providing reasonably priced, high quality produce to the city's population, and bringing more foot traffic into the downtown area. The Wednesday market met with instant success in its first year. Today, the Wednesday Farmers Market is widely recognized as one of the largest and most diverse grower-only CFM's in the nation. Some nine thousands food shoppers, and many of Los Angeles' best known chefs and restaurants, are keyed to the seasonal rhythms of the weekly Wednesday Market.",Third Street Promenade,"1351 Third Street Promenade
