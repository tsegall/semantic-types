The artwork is located on the west side of the historic Metro Nashville Courthouse, steps away from the site of the historic April 19, 1960 student-led protest that led then-Mayor Ben West to disavow segregation of Nashville's lunch counters. Artist Walter Hood designed Witness Walls as a set of fragmented sculptural walls, recalling the classical sculpted friezes that pay homage to heroic and mythical events in antiquity. Using carefully selected period photographs, the artist is exploring the full expressive potential of concrete to create a site of remembrance and celebration. Set amid these walls is a lighted pedestal that illuminates the repeated word ""witness"" and reflects the scene. As visitors walk through the artwork’s concave and convex walls, they will encounter Nashvillians taking action—school desegregation, lunch counter sit-ins, economic boycotts, marches, meetings, and Freedom Rides. Surrounded by these images, the artwork’s period music transports visitors to these events and places. The proliferation of images and sounds remind us that the Civil Rights movement was a collective endeavor.

Unveiled at Smith Springs Community Center's July opening, Sky Lake is composed of more than 100 cut pieces of pigmented and dichroic acrylic in various shapes -- iridescent clouds, apple trees and mason jars -- each symbolizing a facet of the history of Smith Springs, including the Tennessee Valley Authority’s flooding of the community in 1964 to create Percy Priest Lake. The shapes converge to form a deconstructed lake, floating in the center’s entryway and reflecting--literally and figuratively--the legacy of the community. At the center of the installation is a water pump, a tribute to the submerged natural spring that still feeds the lake. “I wanted to play with transparency, light and space to evoke water and sky,” said Williams, “and I especially wanted to pay homage to the lake itself and to the people and history of Smith Springs.” The artist was influenced by several icons in art who have transformed the idea of a suspended work of art that Alexander Calder made famous. Contemporary artists such as Do-Ho Suh, Emmanuelle Moureaux, Michael Murphy, Cai Guo-Qiang, Nick Cave and Claire Morgan helped steer the many revisions that led to the final iconic footprint and design of Sky Lake.","https://www.metroartsnashville.com/fullscreen-page/comp-jkx0tpry/42bf573b-6cf9-11e9-a9ff-063f49e9a7e4/21/%3Fi%3D21%26p%3Djmz0l%26s%3Dstyle-ju8mdzea%26rl%3D1","36.088307","-86.609775","POINT (-86.609775 36.088307)"

Artist Statement “My goal in designing this rack was to make a visually and artistically interesting piece of art, while also keeping the design practical and useful. I want the rack to clearly communicate it is available to the public for the purpose of locking bicycles. I also wanted to create something that reminds the public that biking is a great healthy, environmentally-friendly way to commute and explore our city. In addition, I like the idea that the materials for this rack are sourced locally. Tied into this idea of using local materials is the concept of sustainability, which is always an undercurrent in my work. I mainly work with recycled metal and glass. Most of the art I create is functional and many of my large metal and glass pieces serve as light fixtures.” I am passionate about public art because they allow art to reach more people than just those who can afford to purchase professional art. Public art allows people to interact with art on a daily basis instead of just in museums. Artist Biography Michael Allison lives and works out of his studio in Joelton, TN.

Fifteen up-lights are embedded into the landscaping to light up the sculpture at night, which results in a vibrant display of color, light and shadow. “Stix occupies almost the entirety of the available space and creates an overall volume of urban dimensions,” says Moeller. “Instead of developing an artwork for the roundabout, my goal became to turn the entire roundabout into an artwork. The result is a large structural piece characterized by color with unlimited 360º viewing angles, making the journey around this roundabout an exciting visual experience. What some people might read as a cluster of gigantic arrows fallen from the sky or scattered horse jumping rails is a piece of contemporary art, which will age beautifully given its composition of native hardwood and vibrant colors.” Moeller, a native of Frankfurt, Germany, was a professor at the State College of Design in Karlsruhe, Germany until moving to the United States in 2001. Currently he is a professor in the Department of Design/Media Arts at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) and operates his studio in Silver Lake, Calif.","https://www.metroartsnashville.com/fullscreen-page/comp-jkx0tpry/42bf74dc-6cf9-11e9-a9ff-063f49e9a7e4/22/%3Fi%3D22%26p%3Djmz0l%26s%3Dstyle-ju8mdzea%26rl%3D1","36.154697","-86.779386","POINT (-86.779386 36.154697)"

The 100’ x 100’ x 60’ sculpture was Nashville’s first Percent for Public Art commission. The artwork references the site’s industrial past and visually echoes current surroundings, including nearby bridges and the NFL Titans stadium. Its dynamic form conveys a sense of the area’s evolution from an industrial working river to recreation and entertainment. The main structure of the sculpture is comprised of arced, red-painted steel trusses that twist upward from the crane base to form a disconnected spherical shape. On the ground, a red-painted aluminum “turbine whirlwind” serves as a visual generator for the swirling trusses above. At night, a glowing neon fixture illuminates the sculpture’s center. Aycock sees the piece as a work of static animation. “It changes as you move around it,” she says. “It suggests a certain kind of movement, dance movements, which is why I refer to it as a Ghost Ballet.” Ghost Ballet for the East Bank Machineworks was selected by the Americans for the Arts 2010 Public Art Network's Year in Review 50-Year Retrospective as one of the best 50 public art projects over the past 50 years.","https://www.metroartsnashville.com/fullscreen-page/comp-jkx0tpry/42bdef1e-6cf9-11e9-a9ff-063f49e9a7e4/10/%3Fi%3D10%26p%3Djmz0l%26s%3Dstyle-ju8mdzea%26rl%3D1","36.163256","-86.772114","POINT (-86.772114 36.163256)"

A bold and experiential sculpture, the art forms a nexus between the river and downtown Nashville. The sculpture takes advantage of the dynamic views from many nearby vantage points, and its reflectivity and color make it interactive and always changing throughout the day and night. Conceptually, the artwork draws on the city’s relationship to the river, symbolically reuniting the city’s past and present as well as the natural and urban environment of downtown. The form of the sculpture is based on the meandering curves of the Cumberland River as it passes through Davidson County. The very top of the sculpture, pointing toward the sky, includes stainless steel textile of reflective metal guitar picks. On the top portion of the city-facing side of the sculpture, color changing LED strip lights illuminate a series of horizontally inset acrylic rods, creating a textured ribbon of electric light at night. The lighting draws from the changing colors and qualities of light on the river. At the lowest bend, there is a seating area of durable hardwood allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the experience of the undulating form, reflections and colored light. The river side of Light Meander includes a highly polished surface which reflects the area and visitors in unique and playful ways.","https://www.metroartsnashville.com/fullscreen-page/comp-jkx0tpry/42be3196-6cf9-11e9-a9ff-063f49e9a7e4/12/%3Fi%3D12%26p%3Djmz0l%26s%3Dstyle-ju8mdzea%26rl%3D1","36.1602534","-86.7727681","POINT (-86.7727681 36.1602534)"
