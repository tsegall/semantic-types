Strathcona County has deliberately tried to slow traffic (i.e the twining of Highway 21 from Wye to Yellowhead with a slower speed limit than it had before twinning) and numerous other areas in the county, causing everyone to speed and endangering the people that drive only speed limit.  Stop installing unneeded traffic lights, unneeded stop signs and useless traffic circles.  Why did anyone need traffic lights at Wye Road and Ridgemont Way?  There was no need for it, and now everyone is sitting waiting and traffic doesn't flow.  Why did we need traffic lights at virtually every intersection on Broadmoor from Main all the way to the Yellowhead?  It makes no sense.

Overall I believe it's fairly safe the only place I see residential speeding is on main roads through neighborhoods joining different areas creating short cuts. If these were wider, it wouldn't be so hazardous.  Didn't find a general comment section at the end so I'm adding this. I strongly believe all intersections with red light cameras should have walk/don't walk countdown timers as this would allow people to know if they will need to stop or not instead of waiting until the last second covering the brake. This allows drivers to focus on other hazards (as coming up to an intersection is always full of things to be aware of). I frequently find myself focusing more of my attention than I'd like to have to on the lights to ensure I'm ready for a yellow/red light. This advanced warning is extremely important in the winter when stopping distances are increased as if you know you are going to be close to not making it through an intersection on green you can begin stopping earlier.  I believe all major intersections would benefit from countdown timers. But at the very least, all ones with red light cameras should be looked at first. I know many have been switched over in the last couple years but some major intersections on Wye/Baseline are still outstanding.","Somewhat disagree","Strongly disagree","Neither agree nor disagree","Neither agree nor disagree","Somewhat disagree","Neither agree nor disagree","Not sure","No",,,,,"No","25 to 44","Male","Online"
