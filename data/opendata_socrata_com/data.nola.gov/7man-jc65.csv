Effective January 1, 2016, all businesses will be required to collect an additional 0.2495% in sales/use tax on taxable items and services sold or delivered into the new French Quarter Economic Development District (French Quarter EDD). Funds generated from an additional quarter cent sales tax within the boundaries of the French Quarter Management District (see map below), will be used to form the French Quarter Economic Development District and fund full-time Louisiana State Police trooper patrols in this area. This added security for the residents, workers and visitors of the French Quarter would supplement the New Orleans Police Department services already committed to the area. An additional quarter cent sales tax in the French Quarter Management District will generate at least $2 million each year for public safety. These funds would be generated primarily by the tourists who visit the French Quarter. If passed, hospitality organizations would match these funds for state troopers. Plus, the City of New Orleans would allocate $500,000 from its portion of the hotel self-assessment. All told, if passed, at least $4.5 million will be generated to support a minimum of 30 full-time state troopers.","569","2018-01-23T23:55:00.000Z","2020-11-12T10:21:00.000Z",,,"218","WhitneyS",,,"published",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://data.nola.gov/resource/xcvk-8kcc.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"usuy-y6jj",,"official"

This on-going inventory process will help us to categorize and identify data that could be made publicly available. This process also assists our ability to work cross-departmentally and increases our resilience.

Why is the data inventory important? 
•	Stimulate new ideas and services. By publishing a data inventory, city departments may help to stimulate new and innovative ideas from the community. 
•	Increase internal sharing and resilience. A data inventory can also help us access information from other departments that we need to improve service delivery and resilience planning. 
•	Enabling better and more up-to-date processes. The process of publishing a data inventory will help us to realize the constraints of current City technology and processes, and then plan for future improvements. 
•	Changing how we use data. A data inventory can help empower us to change how we use, share and consume our data externally and internally, ultimately transforming data into better services for citizens and fostering continuous improvement.","4485","2017-11-06T16:31:00.000Z","2019-01-10T18:53:00.000Z","City Administration","data,inventory,city of new orleans,open data,city data","1746","WhitneyS","","Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)","published",,,"City of New Orleans",,,,"Excel",,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology and Innovation",,,,,,,,,,"https://data.nola.gov/resource/dhg4-3vbu.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"usuy-y6jj",,"official"

The primary purpose of Census Tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. In 1980 the New Orleans City Planning Commission, for planning and decision-making purposes, divided the city into Census Tract based 'neighborhoods'. Additional neighborhoods were created after the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Following Hurricane Katrina the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center (GNOCDC) settled on these boundaries to facilitate the use of local data in decision-making. These neighborhoods underwent further change during the 2010 Census due to modifications (consolidation and/or splitting) of Census Tracts, the resulting boundaries were renamed as 'Neighborhood Statistical Areas' to reflect their actual function.","774","2016-11-18T23:04:00.000Z","2016-11-18T23:04:00.000Z","Geographic Base Layers","nsa,neighborhood,neighborhood statistical areas,cpc,planning,egis","0","City of New Orleans GIS Department","gis@nola.gov","Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)","published",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"City Planning Commission",,,,,,,"public",,,"https://data.nola.gov/resource/c2j2-5qdf.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"guap-8ddq",,"official"

Place-based policies can also streamline otherwise redundant and disconnected programs and maximize efficiencies of operation and budget.

The Direct Homebuyer Assistance Program in New Orleans provides down payment and closing costs subsidies to eligible first- time homebuyers.  The subsidies bridge the gap between the price of the home (including closing costs) and the maximum amount a homebuyer can borrow with a first mortgage loan.  The homebuyer receives only the amount of soft second funding that is needed to close the affordability gap. While all areas of the city are eligible for this program. Houses within the Place-Based Strategy Areas are eligible for slightly higher subsidies.","1511","2013-05-28T17:45:00.000Z","2016-08-24T19:51:00.000Z","Archived","new orleans,planning,place-based","1225","City of New Orleans GIS Department","gis@nola.gov","Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)","published",,,"City of New Orleans – Office of Information Technology & Innovation, Enterprise Information Team",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"City of New Orleans - Office of Community Development",,,,,,,,,,"https://data.nola.gov/resource/ssw4-9pg7.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"guap-8ddq",,"official"
