"16-1278","","I am writing to request the opportunity to inspect and copy public records in your control and custody, pursuant to Public Records Act, La.R.S. 44:1, et seq. I request all information held by the New Orleans Police Department regarding the following case: 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOPD Item&nbsp;H-11027-10 
 This item number corresponds to a non-fatal shooting in which the victim was identified as&nbsp;Shaquille Cooper aka ""Shaq."" 
 This request includes, but is not limited to, any and all incident and supplemental records, documents, reports, analyses, notes, memoranda, audio tapes, charts and any other records not exempted from the Louisiana Public Records Act. I request these records whether they be in an individual officers’ files, in the possession of members or former members of the New Orleans Police Department, on microfilm or microfiche, or otherwise stored or maintained. 
 Louisiana’s Public Record Act, La R.S. 44:3 states that records of law enforcement agencies can be exempted “pending criminal litigation or any criminal litigation which can be reasonably anticipated....” That standard does not apply in this situation. Regarding the records of law enforcement agencies, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that “the Public Records Act must be liberally construed in favor of public access,” and that access “can be denied only when the law specifically and unequivocally provides against access.” Harrison v. Norris, 569 So. 2d 585 (La 1990). See also Lemmon v. Connick, 590 So. 2d 574, (La 1991).&nbsp; 
 I request that you direct each division or department of the NOPD that may have evidence of any kind relating to these requests to make those items available to me also, within the time provided for by the Public Records Act. I request access to the above-mentioned records, so that I, or my designees, may review and copy them. Any copying costs will be paid upon submission of an invoice for reasonable fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Should you determine any of the requested materials to be exempt from public disclosure, I would also request, in writing, a list of each document being withheld, along with a basis under the law for your contention that each record is exempt from the Public Records Act. See La. R.S. 44:32(D). Please notify me regarding your response within three days, as required by law. I appreciate your attention to this matter.

"16-1277","","I am writing to request the opportunity to inspect and copy public records in your control and custody, pursuant to Public Records Act, La.R.S. 44:1, et seq. I request all information held by the New Orleans Police Department regarding the following case: 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOPD Item&nbsp;A-35005-13 
 This item number corresponds to a homicide that occurred on January&nbsp;26, 2013 in&nbsp;the 1800 block of&nbsp;Conti St.,&nbsp;New Orleans, in which the victim was identified as&nbsp;Shaquille Cooper aka ""Shaq."" 
 This request includes, but is not limited to, any and all incident and supplemental records, documents, reports, analyses, notes, memoranda, audio tapes, charts and any other records not exempted from the Louisiana Public Records Act. I request these records whether they be in an individual officers’ files, in the possession of members or former members of the New Orleans Police Department, on microfilm or microfiche, or otherwise stored or maintained. 
 Louisiana’s Public Record Act, La R.S. 44:3 states that records of law enforcement agencies can be exempted “pending criminal litigation or any criminal litigation which can be reasonably anticipated....” That standard does not apply in this situation. Regarding the records of law enforcement agencies, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that “the Public Records Act must be liberally construed in favor of public access,” and that access “can be denied only when the law specifically and unequivocally provides against access.” Harrison v. Norris, 569 So. 2d 585 (La 1990). See also Lemmon v. Connick, 590 So. 2d 574, (La 1991).&nbsp; 
 I request that you direct each division or department of the NOPD that may have evidence of any kind relating to these requests to make those items available to me also, within the time provided for by the Public Records Act. I request access to the above-mentioned records, so that I, or my designees, may review and copy them. Any copying costs will be paid upon submission of an invoice for reasonable fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Should you determine any of the requested materials to be exempt from public disclosure, I would also request, in writing, a list of each document being withheld, along with a basis under the law for your contention that each record is exempt from the Public Records Act. See La. R.S. 44:32(D). Please notify me regarding your response within three days, as required by law. I appreciate your attention to this matter.

"17-1876","","To whom it may concern:  Under the Louisiana Public Records Law, I am requesting records related to the case management system(s) that New Orleans Police Department personnel have used to track major felony cases, and investigatory work on major felony cases, since at least 2005, through the date in which this request is filled. If multiple case management systems have been used by the Department during that time period, I am requesting information on each of those systems.  The records should include:  - Any contracts with the company that created the case management system(s), if created by an outside company.  - The data dictionary, glossary of terms, record layout, and any other documentation that describes the case management system(s).  - The instruction manual, patrol guide, or any other type of guide, distributed to law enforcement personnel dictating how they should use the case management system(s).  I am requesting that all records be provided to me in their original electronic file format, whenever possible, which I am entitled to under the law. (The requestor can choose to receive electronic records in electronic format. St. Tammany Parish Coroner v. Doe, 48 So.3d 1241 (La.App. 1st Cir. 2010); Johnson v. City of Pineville, 9 So.3d 313 (La.App. 3d Cir. 2009).)  For example, if the department has a PDF of the instruction manual for the case management system, I am requesting that I receive that instruction manual as a PDF instead of a printed copy of the PDF.  As a member of the media reporting on matters in the public interest, I am requesting a fee waiver and an expediting of my request. However, since I am requesting records in their original electronic file format whenever possible, I expect the costs, if any, to be limited.  Under the Louisiana Public Records Law, I am entitled to a response within three days. If my request will take longer than three days to be filled, please state the reason in writing and the date I can expect to receive the records.   If you deny any portion of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.  I am requesting that communication regarding this request be conducted via email, and that the request be filled via email.  Thank you for considering my request.

 1. &nbsp;I’m seeking a copy of the Wisner-BP settlement agreement entered into at some time in advance of the June 2, 2016 dismissal with prejudice of the Wisner Donation’s lawsuit against BP in U.S. District Court. I note that the motion to dismiss, filed May 26, 2016, was made on behalf of: &nbsp;&nbsp;""the Plaintiffs, Edward Wisner Donation, Mayor Mitch J. Landrieu acting&nbsp;on behalf of the City of New Orleans as Trustee of the Edward Wisner Donation and the City of&nbsp;New Orleans individually as a beneficiary; The Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund&nbsp;as a beneficiary; Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and&nbsp;Mechanical College as a beneficiary; The Salvation Army Inc. as a beneficiary; and the Wisner&nbsp;Heirs as beneficiaries identified on attached Exhibit “A” through undersigned counsel, pursuant&nbsp;to the Full and Final Release, Settlement, and Covenant Not to Sue entered into by the parties, ..."" &nbsp;&nbsp;Also noted is that the City of New Orleans municipal code creates the advisory committee: &nbsp;https://www.municode.com/library/la/new_orleans/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICO_CH2AD_ARTIVBOCOCO_DIV4EDWIDOADCO 
 ""Sec. 2-159. - Function. 
 
 
 Subject to the control and direction of the council, the powers, duties and functions of the Edward Wisner Donation Advisory Committee shall be the supervision, direction and administration of all of the lands, funds and avails constituting and comprising the Wisner donation, or the avails or fruits thereof, and to consult with and advise the mayor in his capacity as trustee upon all matters pertaining to such trust and the mayor when acting upon the advice of the committee, or a majority thereof, shall be deemed to be acting for and in behalf of all the parties at interest. To that end all matters relating to the trust shall in the first instance be referred to and handled by the committee."" 
 
 
 2. &nbsp;I’m also seeking copies of any associated documents, including agreements between Wisner Donation and BP or other parties concerning the spending of any money the Wisner Donation has received or will receive under the agreement or under any other agreement associated with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 
 3. &nbsp;I’m also seeking any information, including agreements, budgets and plans, for restoration of damage caused by the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill to property owned or controlled by the Wisner Donation. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, the Public Records Act requires that public records be provided for inspection and, if requested, copying within, at most, three days. If any of the records do not exist or will not be provided, you must notify me within, at most, three days regarding the reason(s) for the delay or refusal. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any questions about this request, or need additional information in determining what records I am requesting, please call me at 504-826-3327 or 504-717-1157, or contact me by email at mschleifstein@nola.com. 
 Note that the Louisiana Public Records Act includes this provision:&nbsp; 
 §33.1. Custodian; contact information 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each public body that has a custodian of public records shall make the contact information of the custodian available to the public in a manner that will allow a member of the public to quickly determine the appropriate person to whom a public records request should be submitted, including by placing such information on the internet. 
 If this advisory committee or the Mayor is not the custodian of the records I request, please inform me to whom I&nbsp;should make this request.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely yours,

"16-2572","","To whom it may concern,&nbsp; 
 I am seeking the following public records, regardless of physical form or characteristics: 
 &nbsp; 
 -Records sufficient to show the total annual value of property and money seized through the department’s Asset Forfeiture fund each year between 1998 and 2016. 
  -Records sufficient to show the total annual amount of money spent through the department’s Asset Forfeiture fund each year between 1998 and 2016. 
 &nbsp; 
 -Records sufficient to show every documented Asset Forfeiture cash seizure between 1998 and 2016, including information on the race of the subject of the seizure, the location of the seizure, the address of the subject of the seizure, the amount of cash seized, and the date of the seizure. (If this information is available in an excel sheet, this would be preferable to thousands of sheets of documentation. Please let me know if any of this information is difficult to locate and I would be willing to consider modifying or abridging this section of the request)  -Purchasing order documents for any departmental purchases over $3,000, paid for with Asset&nbsp;Forfeiture funds, between 1998 and 2016. 
 &nbsp; 
 I am making this request as a journalist. I am frequent reporter for national outlets such as The Guardian US and The Nation magazine and am submitting this request for non-commercial purposes. My request is simple, solely limited to procurement records, and is crucial for the public's ability to understand the surveillance capabilities of law enforcement officers and to know how their tax dollars are being spent. Therefore, I request any fee waivers or expedited processing that the department may on occasion grant to reporters.&nbsp;  If no fee waivers are possible, I am&nbsp;willing to pay for reasonable fees, but I ask that these fees be itemized and justified.  If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the act. I will also expect you to release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. I, of course, reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.  As I am making this request as a journalist and this information is of timely value, I would appreciate your communicating with me by telephone, rather than by mail, if you have questions regarding this request. I would like to receive the information in electronic format. I would prefer any documents located be sent to me via email to&nbsp;georgejosephsws@gmail.com.  Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter.

 George","Media Request - NOPD","https://nola.nextrequest.com/requests/16-2572","2016-12-22T15:12:08.000","2017-01-20T23:59:59.000","2016-12-22T15:12:08.000","2017-01-18T09:25:48.000","2018-10-31T10:47:19.000","Closed","2017-01-18T09:25:48.000","Closed - Waiting for Payment or Schedule Review","Jezreel Joseph","George Joseph"

"17-3984","","Date:&nbsp; October 2, 2017 
 &nbsp; 
 To:&nbsp; New Orleans Police Department 
 &nbsp; 
 Subject:&nbsp; Reuters News Public Records Request, Via&nbsp;Records Form 
 &nbsp; 
 I am a journalist for Reuters News. I hereby request the following data, records and information pursuant to the Louisiana Public Records Law.&nbsp; I am hoping to receive these records by Oct. 23, 2017.&nbsp; Please keep me up-to-date on the progress, and let me know if there is a way to narrow my request to make it quicker and easier for you to fill.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 In a PowerPoint slide provided by Taser International (which recently changed its name to Axon Enterprise), the company stated the following about statistics from the New Orleans Police Department: 
 &nbsp; 
 Statistics from NOPD PIB: Use of Force Incident Reports 
 2008 injured officers 64 
 2009 injured officers 26 &nbsp;(59% ▼) 
 2010 injured officers 6 (77% ▼) 
 &nbsp; 
 Priority 1 
 This is the priority part of my request: 
 &nbsp; 
 
 The year the New Orleans Police Department began using Tasers. 
 For the New Orleans Police Department:&nbsp; The total number of officers injured, from Use of Force Incident Reports, on an annual basis for 1999 – 2016. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Priority 2 
 I am also requesting the following data, but depending on availability and how long it would take to pull.&nbsp; If the items listed under “Priority 2” would hold up filling the request for the items in “Priority 1” please call me and let me know, because I might want to adjust my request. 
 &nbsp; 
 
 For the New Orleans Police Department:&nbsp; The total dollar value of workers’ compensation claims, resulting from Use of Force incidents, for officers on an annual basis for 1999 - 2016. 
 For the New Orleans Police Department:&nbsp; The total number of suspects injured, from Use of Force incidents, on an annual basis for 1999 - 2016. 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Date Range 
 I am asking for the data on an annual basis for 1999 – 2016.&nbsp; I realize this is a long range.&nbsp; For each portion of the request, if data is not available going back as far as 1999, please let me know and we can discuss what is available and I can change my request to reflect that timeframe. &nbsp;Or, if the data is available back to 1999 but going back that far would add a significant amount of time and effort, please let me know and we can also discuss. 
 &nbsp; 
 Format 
 I prefer to receive records in the following formats, listed in order of preference: (1) an electronic data format such as a spreadsheet, delimited data set, database file, or similar structured data file; (2) other non-proprietary electronic format.&nbsp; I am hoping that these records are already kept on an annual basis, perhaps in some kind of database or annual report.&nbsp; If these records are not readily available in an electronic data format, but are available in some form of report that already exists (such as an annual report to the city council), please send me the reports. 
 &nbsp; 
 If you decide to exempt a portion of any record, please release all other segregable parts. If you withhold any record or portion of a record, please specify which statutory exemptions are claimed for each withholding. 
 &nbsp; 
 Fee Waiver Request 
 If there are any search, review, or duplication fees greater than $25, please inform me before you fill the request. But first please consider my requests for fee reduction and fee waiver. This request is being made in connection with Reuters News’ newsgathering functions and not for any other commercial purpose. Reuters News intends to produce one or more original investigative reports based on analysis of the requested information that will inform the public about how tax dollars are used in New Orleans. 
 &nbsp; 
 If you have any questions about any aspect of this request, please contact me at paula.seligson@thomsonreuters.com or 919-744-9190. 
 &nbsp; 
 Thank you for your attention to this request.

"16-1941","","Hi, 
 &nbsp; 
 Pursuant to the state’s public records law, I am requesting access to and copies of records from your agency as part of our continuing coverage of gun trafficking. I have broken the request into four parts, each of which details the records that we are seeking. As expressed below, the date range for each part of this request is January 1, 2010 to the present: 
 &nbsp; 
 1) Detailed information on stolen guns  
 &nbsp;It is our understanding that law enforcement agencies keep detailed records about firearms that were reported stolen by the citizens they serve. We are therefore requesting the following for each case of reported firearm theft in your jurisdiction:&nbsp; 
 -- The police report number and/or incident number for the firearm theft 
 -- The serial number, make, model, caliber, type and any other descriptive information for each firearm that was reported stolen 
 I would be grateful if this data was collated into a spreadsheet where each row represents one case. Here is an example: 
 &nbsp; 




 Case Number 


 Firearm Serial Number 


 Firearm Make 


 Firearm Model 


 Firearm Caliber 


 Firearm type 


 Other descriptive information 




 15-0001 


 1234 


 Glock 


 G31 


 0.357 


 Handgun 


 Black grip 




 15-0002 


 2345 


 Smith &amp; Wesson 


 M&amp;P 15 SPORT 


 5.56mm 


 Rifle 


 Scope attachment 




 15-0003 


 3456 


 Glock 


 G37 


 0.45 


 Handgun 


 Tan grip 




 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;If a database is provided, please provide the record layout and/or code sheet. The date range for this part is January 1, 2010 to the present. 
 &nbsp; 
 2) Detailed information about crime guns  
 &nbsp;Second, it is our understanding that law enforcement agencies maintain detailed records about firearms that were used in crimes, recovered at crimes scenes or seized during investigations in their jurisdictions, including the make, model and serial number of each gun. We are therefore requesting the following: 
 &nbsp;-- The following records regarding firearms used in crimes in your agency’s jurisdiction, recovered at crime scenes, seized during investigations or otherwise recovered: the make, model, and serial number of each gun; the date of the crime and/or incident from which it was recovered; the police report number for the crime and/or incident; the type of crime the firearm was used in; and the address where the crime was committed and/or the incident occurred.  
 If your agency maintains a spreadsheet or database containing these records, we ask that you please provide that database. I would be grateful if this data was collated into a spreadsheet where each row represents one case, the same as part 1) “Detailed information about stolen guns.” If a spreadsheet is provided, please also provide a record layout and/or code sheet. 
 &nbsp;I would like to note that we are not at this time seeking copies of police reports or any other investigative records associated with these crimes; we are only seeking information about the firearms used and some general information about the crimes that is generally released to the public. 
 &nbsp;The date range for this part is also January 1, 2010 to the present. 
 &nbsp; 
 3) Detailed information on lost, stolen or unaccounted for law enforcement guns 
 &nbsp;Third, it is our understanding that law enforcement agencies maintain detailed records about firearms that, while under the control and/or in the possession of their employees, went missing, were lost or stolen, or are otherwise accounted for. Therefore we request the following: 
 &nbsp;-- Any and all records of department-issued firearms that were lost, stolen, went missing or are otherwise accounted for. 
 &nbsp;-- If your department does not issue firearms, then we ask for any and all records of firearms that were lost, stolen, went missing or otherwise became unaccounted for while under the control and/or in the possession of one of your employees. 
 &nbsp;The records should include but not be limited to the following: 
 
 The make, model, serial number and caliber of each lost or stolen firearm 
 The location and address where the firearm was stolen 
 The date of the loss or theft. 
 The date the lost or theft was reported 
 Whether each lost or stolen firearm was recovered 
 If the lost or stolen firearm was recovered, the date and location of the recovery 
 A description of how the firearm was lost or stolen 
 Whether negligence on the part of the employee is/was suspected in the loss or theft of the firearm 
 Whether the employee in control of the firearm retired, was terminated or otherwise left the department, and if so, the date and circumstances of the employee’s departure and whether his or her gun was retrieved and/or recovered. 
 Any other individual reports and findings on the individual lost or stolen firearms 
 
 The records should include but not be limited to databases, reports, memos, internal affairs investigations, emails or other correspondence, and/or any other records. 
 &nbsp;The date range for this part is also January 1, 2010 to the present. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;4) Number of sworn law enforcement personnel 
 &nbsp;Finally, the Federal Bureau of Investigation publishes annually data on the number of law enforcement officers employed by city agencies as part of its Uniform Crime Reporting program. The number of officers employed by your department was not included in the FBI’s 2015 dataset, the most recent one available. Therefore, we are requesting the following: 
 &nbsp;-- The number of law enforcement officers employed by your department. Please only provide the number sworn law enforcement officers, excluding all civilian employees. 
 &nbsp;Please label each record in a clear manner. As a news organization, we will be making information obtained from this request available to the general public and are not requesting it for commercial purposes. 
 In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you informed me of the total charges before completing my request. We request that if you send an invoice, you make it out to The Trace.  
 &nbsp;I would prefer the requested information be sent via an e-mail attachment if available, or a mailed CD-ROM if not. If standard mail must be used, we ask that you send the request to the following address:

"17-810","","Any and all correspondence (e-mail or otherwise) regarding any formal or informal zoning determination that was rendered, considered or pending with respect to 1540 First Street, 2400 St. Charles Avenue, or 2416 St. Charles Avenue (hereinafter the ""Subject Property""). 
 This request specifically seeks any determination, or discussion of the ability to construct and operate a ""Residential Care Facility,"" as that term is defined in the City of New Orleans Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, and permitted in Article, 11, Section 11.2/Table 11-1 of the CZO using the same waivers and/or variances granted in Zoning Docket 83-15, Ordinance No. 26,683 M.C.S. which effective on November 12, 2015.&nbsp; 
 This particular&nbsp;zoning docket and ensuing Ordinance was&nbsp;pursuant to an application, public advertisement, public hearings, and the passage of an ordinance for a Conditional Use to allow for a multi-family residential condominium building&nbsp;with a height of&nbsp;sixty (60') feet to be constructed on the Subject&nbsp;Property, and recent conversations with various members of the City Planning Commission Staff have revealed that,&nbsp;despite the fact that fact that&nbsp;by their very nature, Conditional Uses are specific to their application, CPC Staff and perhaps the Zoning Administrator and Director of Safety and Permits, the statutory interpreter of the provisions of the CZO, have indicated that a Residential Care Facility, or any other permitted use in the underlying zoning district may&nbsp;be permitted using the&nbsp;waivers and heights of the completely different use&nbsp;than that which was&nbsp;presented in Zoning Docket 83-15, Ordinance No. 26,683 M.C.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 This request should, at a minimum, be forwarded to the following City of New Orleans employees:&nbsp; Robert D. Rivers, Leslie T. Alley, Stephen K. Kroll, Dr. Jared E. Minster, Edward J. Horan, and Todd Breckmann.&nbsp;&nbsp;

"16-991","","Dear&nbsp;custodian of records: 
 Pursuant to Louisiana Public Records Law, La. Rev. Stat. §44:1, et seq.,&nbsp;I am requesting an opportunity to obtain copies of public records related to a murder case in 1981. The incident occurred on February 8, 1981, when a Robert Collins was murdered when an explosive device detonated his car. 
 I’m specifically seeking the jail mug shots of two men -- Clarence Michael Smith and Anthony Scire -- arrested on the charge of the murder. Both were tried for the case, found guilty on Feb 4, 1985, and sentenced to death row (State of Louisiana v Clarence Smith and Anthony Scire, Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, Section “G” No. 298-874). 
 In 1993, their conviction was overturned on a technicality, and they were found not guilty in a retrial in 1994. Here is some identifying information for&nbsp;one of the defendants (unfortunately don’t have the DOB of Scire): 
 &nbsp; 
 CLARENCE MICHAEL SMITH – “SMITTY” 
 Caucasian 
 Male 
 DOB 3/22/44 
 &nbsp; 
 Additionally, I’m looking for any crime scene photos, police records (complaint, arrest, warrant), or video/audio tapes related to the case.&nbsp; 
 If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me of the cost.&nbsp;I’m a representative of the news media and my request is related to news-gathering purposes.&nbsp;This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. 
 Should you deny my request, or any part of the request, please state in writing the basis for the denial, including the exact statutory citation authorizing the denial as required by s. 119.07(1)(d), F.S.

I am current fellow at The Atlantic's CityLab and a frequent reporter for national outlets such as The Guardian US and The Nation magazine and am submitting this request for non-commercial purposes. My request is simple, solely limited to procurement records, and is crucial for the public's ability to understand the surveillance capabilities of law enforcement officers and to know how their tax dollars are being spent. Therefore, I request any fee waivers or expedited processing that the department may on occasion grant to reporters.&nbsp;  If no fee waivers are possible, I am&nbsp;willing to pay for reasonable fees, but I ask that these fees be itemized and justified.  If my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the act.

I, of course, reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any information or to deny a waiver of fees.

"16-1646","Email","Dear City Attorney Dietz: 
 &nbsp; 
 I have sent you a couple of emails concerning the legality of the commercial&nbsp;development of 801 Rosedale, N.O. LA, 70124, and have not yet received any substantive response from you regarding my and the neighbors' concerns about it. 
 &nbsp; 
 Yesterday I spoke about the property with a Mr. Bao in the zoning department, as we do not agree that the zoning&nbsp;on and use of this property was properly changed from residential to commercial. At the point in time when Councilmember Guidry removed a C.U. from this property by a motion made about a year ago,&nbsp;the zoning&nbsp;should have reverted to the underlying zoning, which was residential. The residential zoning would have protected our neighborhood from the negative effects of the change in use, including extended hours of service to 11pm. As I understand it, a pre-existing C.U. should have prevented any change of the underlying residential zoning, the site itself, and any improvements thereon. 
 &nbsp; 
 During my conversation with the zoning department&nbsp;employee, I was&nbsp;informed&nbsp;that your office can provide me with the entire zoning history, including any and all relevant reports, therefore I am hereby making a public records request for that information. I would like to see that this week, if possible, as I am off work and readily available to go to City Hall and inspect these records any time. 
 &nbsp; 
 Please let me know the best time for me to visit your office and review these records. Also, I would like to suggest that the Council consider placing a moratorium on the commencement of any commercial use of 801 Rosedale Drive, the property in question, until we can verify that the changes to this zoning were done in accordance with law. 
 &nbsp; 
 By the way, the C.U. sections of the CZO are not 100% viewable on the city website. Hopefully, that is just an unfortunate and accidental program error, however, I would appreciate&nbsp;if that could be addressed and fixed. We citizens need to be able to see the entire CZO document or else there is no transparency.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 Thank you. 
 &nbsp; 
 Sincerely, 
 David Licciardi

"17-1791","","May 8, 2017  To whom it may concern: 
 Under the Louisiana Public Records Act § 44:1 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain documentation of donations, costs and expenditures related to the removal of monuments to Robert E. Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard, Jefferson Davis and the Battle of Liberty Place whether those records are kept by the city of New Orleans or the Foundation For Louisiana, which is serving as an agent of the city to provide a public service.  This request is made pursuant to the Louisiana Supreme Court decision in&nbsp;2016-C-1809 NEW ORLEANS BULLDOG SOCIETY v. LOUISIANA SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS, ET AL.,&nbsp;in which the justices found that outside organizations are subject to public records laws when they serve as an ""instrumentality of a municipal corporation."" The Foundation's actions assisting the city in executing the requirements of Ordinance Calendar Number 31,082 through various CEAs fall within that definition.  Specifically, I am seeking:  - Any documentation of any donations received to pay for the removal of the monuments or any other actions authorized or required by Cal. No. 31,082, including the name of the donor, the amount of the donation and the date. These records should include but not be limited to copies of checks received and receipts of transactions. - Any documentation of expenditures by the city or the Foundation For Louisiana authorized or required by Cal. No. 31,082, including payments to contractors or reimbursements for work done by city employees. This should include the name of the contractors, invoices for work, estimates for the cost of work and any other documentation related to the removal. - Any other communication between the Foundation For Louisiana and the city or any outside companies or groups related to the removal of the monuments. 
 If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50. However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes. 
 Section 44:32(D) of the Louisiana Public Records Act requires a response within three business days. If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records. 
 If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.  The Foundation For Louisiana will also receive a copy of this request. 
 Please feel free to call&nbsp;or email me with any questions on this request.

 I’m seeking a copy of the Wisner-BP settlement agreement entered into at some time in advance of the June dismissal with prejudice of the Wisner Donation’s lawsuit against BP in U.S. District Court. I’m also seeking copies of any associated documents, including agreements between Wisner Donation and BP or other parties concerning the spending of any money the Wisner Donation has received or will receive under the agreement or under any other agreement associated with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. 
 I’m also seeking any information, including agreements, budgets and plans, for restoration of damage caused by the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill to property owned or controlled by the Wisner Donation.

We request a copy of the document that memorializes the terms of the deal. 
 Here’s an excerpt of the article:&nbsp; 
 In New Orleans specifically, Airbnb agreed to share data — such as the names and addresses of its hosts — with the city, something the company has balked at doing elsewhere. Airbnb also agreed that its hosts must operate with a permit, with hosts automatically being registered with the city when they sign up to the service. In a nod to the local hotel industry, Airbnb will also ban almost all listings in the city’s historic French Quarter and set a 90-day annual cap for hosts who rent out entire homes.","Mayor's Office","https://nola.nextrequest.com/requests/16-2581","2016-12-23T12:58:50.000","2016-12-29T23:59:59.000","2016-12-23T12:58:50.000","2016-12-29T10:53:53.000","2018-10-31T10:47:20.000","Closed","2016-12-29T10:53:53.000","Closed","Admin Law","ileana cruz"

"17-898","","Hello, My name is Kerry P. Gibson and I live at 1501 Kabel Dr., Algiers 70131. 
 I am disabled and I have been eligible and received a ""FREEZE"" assessment on my home which I own for many years now. 
 Apparently according to the Assessor's office I did not file for my freeze for the tax year 2017 by the deadline and my tax bill which gets paid by my mortgage company has almost tripled from around $500.00 to now at $1,200.00.2 
 I am&nbsp;now told by the assessors office staff that my freeze assessment for future years will be at this new much higher amount. 
 The 2 post cards sent out to me reminding me to come in and apply for the assessment have NO DEADLINE&nbsp;printed on them. 
 I&nbsp;was not able to come in by the assessor office deadline because I was not able to leave my home due to major surgery done on me on June 15th, 2017. I had to heal and recuperate from that surgery. 
 I tried&nbsp;and requested to speak with Assessor Errol Williams on multiple occasions and&nbsp;even after writing him three different letters and He never would meet with me, only sent out his position on the matter in his letters of response to the letters that I sent him. 
 He did tell me that there were other avenues that I cold pursue in order to have my ""PROPERTY TAX FREEZE"" put back where it belongs retroactively. 
 But Mr. Errol Williams did not tell what these avenues are! 
 So, I am requesting 2 things. 
 1. &nbsp;I want to make a formal complaint about the way I am being treated by the Assessor's office and Mr. Errol Williams for not&nbsp;letting me speak with him about my Freeze Assessment.&nbsp; 
 2. I would like to know from whatever department needs to see this either the ""Legal Department of City Hall"" and/or the ""Assessor's office"" how to go about making the request to have my assessment on my property tax bill for my home ""rolled&nbsp;back&nbsp;retroactively"" to where it belongs because I can prove that I am ""Permanently&nbsp;&nbsp;Disabled"" and to have the over charge of my property tax bill refunded to me through the revenue department. 
 If there is a way to get this done, Assessor Errol Williams should have provided me the proper protocol on how to het this done, he just hinted in a letter to me that this was an avenue I could pursue but did not tell me anything else on how to get this done. 
 Thank You
