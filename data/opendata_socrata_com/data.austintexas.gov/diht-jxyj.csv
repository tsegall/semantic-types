AMANDA reflects that the Portal issued the permit. For AMANDA 6, we had worked DS permits that didn't have a web application process (like the ones pending and attached to BPs) that it would reflect the person who created the invoice. 
However since it doesn't work correctly now AMANDA V7.. to better reflect who issued it, I believe using the person who completed the DS Permitting Review process would work better.

Hello,

I am unable to complete tasks/attempts in AMANDA for approving/rejecting License Agreements etc. I should have the same user permission as Ravi Dhamrat, who upon clicking a license agreement is given a popup to fulfill the task, which I am not given. This prevents me from using AMANDA for approvals and therefor rely on Ravi to submit the action. 

> Is there anything else we should know?

The only difference between our process is that Ravi assigns *himself* from the ATD reviewer, whereas for me, *he* changed the assignment to me. This could be causing the bug, or it could be my account. I have not yet tested if assigning it myself fixes the issue.

## It is also:
ATD-UC Report-Agenda is not generating correctly. It is only generating half the projects it needs to be including in the Agenda report.

It should be adding all folders that have AULCC Meeting Date = selected date for the report.

For AULCC Meeting Date of 8/18/22, it should display ROWIDs 12496035, 12984817, 12986661, 12924652. It is ONLY including 12496035 and 12924652.

Also, monthly I run an AMANDA ""FDU Revenue Report with Waivers (51036)"", but when I try I get an error saying No Data Found.

In Amanda 6 I used to run a report (51036) to track our revenue collected and I have tried finding that report in Amanda 7 in the data reporting section but I don't see it.  I use this report to track our revenue by source code and compare it to the Controller's data so we can know what revenue hasn't posted yet that we need to account for.

**Stakeholder:** Sangeeta, Amber

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Applies to the SP folder
- When attempt 'Distribute CC Reviews' is saved on process 5116 Completeness Check Distribution: 
    - The system inserts process code 51834 CC ATD Review
    - The process is assigned ATD-Reviewers
    - Process start & end dates to mirror the other CC process that are inserted at this time (9 business days)
- When ATD Review process is inserted, the system inserts 'ATD Review' (10091) document on the document tab
    - This document, if generated & sent, merges into 100001 SP - Completeness Check Results Letter
- When 'Incomplete' attempt is saved on 51834 CC ATD Review, the system validates 'ATD Review' (10091) document
    - If document has not been sent, system throws error ""Please generate and complete your review document and then return to this process""
- When 'Complete Without Site Visit' attempt is saved on process 5116 Completeness Check Distribution, the system validates 51834 CC ATD Review process status:
    - If status is not 'Complete' or 'No Review Required', the system throws this error: All review processes must be marked Complete or No Review Required to give this attempt
- If 51834 CC ATD Review process status is 'Incomplete' when the attempt result 'Entered' is saved on process 51118 Completeness Check Update, the system will insert 51834 CC ATD Review process. 
    - Assign process to ATD-Reviewers
    - Process start & end dates to mirror the other CC process that are inserted at this time (7 calendar days)

**Notes:**
- This feature is programmed on the C8 folder and can be referenced as needed. 

**Business Justification:**
We have to rely on DSD Intake staff to manually assign the CC reviews to ATD.  It takes a lot of time on our part to manually search for pending CC cases, then create a process and document for each one, with no guarantee that it will be rejected in time.  When the CC projects don't get assigned to us in time, we miss the review deadline.  The project is deemed complete after 10 days; and it may have a TIA associated with it.  We end up missing SP applications resulting in loss of review causing transportation challenges in the City.  Also, we will get our review fees missed and/ or not added in a timely manner.","TDS",,"8","https://api.github.com/repos/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/4109","2020-10-07T19:35:35.000","2022-08-24T20:17:35.000","215",

This will require updates to the SP & GP folders (both owned by DSD).

**Stakeholders:**
- (ATD) Ryan, Darren, Laura
- (DSD) Deborah F, Zachary W., Roderick B, Zackary M.

### Summary
- **SP:** ATD Staff will identify the TCP Fee requirement during CC, and the fee will be included in the big invoice that intake creates after CC. 
- **GP:** When ATD staff identifies the TCP Fee requirement, they will use a folder process to insert the fee as a stand-alone invoice.

## Acceptance Criteria


### SP folder Acceptance Criteria
**The following process info needs to be configured in the AMANDA Admin Module**
- Info Description: TCP Review Fee Required? 
- Info Type: Boolean
- Info Default Value: Yes
- Info Process: CC Traffic Control Process (51830)

> What application are you using?

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

We recently noticed that we an applicant submits their permit request via ABC Portal, one of the notes that displays states: ""The application has been submitted for review by permit specialist, customer should receive a response within 1 to 5 business days.""

While there are some permits which are reviewed within 1 business day (i.e. emergency and secondary requests), the vast majority are reviewed closer to the 5 business day mark.  We would like to edit this language to more accurately reflect the review timeline.

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

We would like to see the language changed to: ""The application has been submitted for review by a permit analyst.  Customer should receive a response within 5 business days.  Business days exclude weekends and holidays.""

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

We have no workarounds.  The current text could explain why we have so many ppl reach out to us just a couple days after submittal with complaints about delays.

**Stakeholders:** Jacqueline Lozano, isaiah lewallen
**DTS Manager:** Nate

See issue comments for examples of each email that is sent, and the corresponding process that sent the email. 

**Processes that send the emails:**
Application Review (82005), Permit Completeness check (51065), Web Application Acceptance (70000) and Initial Distribution (51070)

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Only one email should be sent to the Applicant, instead of the 2 or 3 being sent (Process to send Email: TBD on Monday 8/3/2020)

- Set one process to be the Email Trigger. Right now they are Web Application Accepted and Permit Completeness Check (Trigger: TBD on Monday 8/3/2020)

- Disable/remove email trigger from other Process

- Update Verbiage on emails (on #3536)

1. Remove Verbiage in all UC emails stating:
""Deliver one (1) half-size paper plan set to Austin Water at 625 E 10th St (Attention: AW-Infrastructure Management AULCC Review) on the Wednesday two weeks prior to your scheduled AULCC meeting and include a screen print displaying your case, tracking or folder number.

2. Verbiage to be changed in the Permit Completeness Check email:
**From** ""10th Floor Conference Room, One Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road""
**To** ""Online via Microsoft TEAMS. You will receive an email invitation with the TEAMS link and optional call in number at a later date""
3. Meeting Date and time will remain the same since they never change (Thursdays at 2pm)
4. Choose 1 of these processes to send one email, turn the email feature on the other 2 processes off. 

**Next Steps:**

- Find lookup table with emails
- Fix the verbiage on emails #3536
- Disable current triggers that send the email to users; Possible triggers Web Application Acceptance (70000) and Permit Completeness Check 51065

Daniil Kontsevoy (daniil.kontsevoy@austintexas.gov) is an existing CoA ATD employee, however he will now be within the Transportation Development Services Division and will need permissions to view, edit and generate comment reports in AMANDA for site plans, site plan corrections, subdivision cases and zoning cases. He should be able to create fees for associated reviews as well. 

These permissions can mirror Dari Majd's profile in TDS (also a Project Coordinator). 

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

Daniil should have full review capabilities for site plan, subdivision and zoning permit applications in AMANDA. This includes approval/rejection capabilities. 

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

We will use a sharepoint folder where he can upload documents for me to manually input and approve/reject for the time being.

Would like to add language to the ABC Portal that reminds applicants that 1. Applicant fees are NON-REFUNDABLE and 2. They should view our Permits page to ensure they are selecting the correct application.

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

Right of way permit applicants will correctly categorize 100% of their application submittals.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

This language is on the portal and our webpages but we still receive several incorrect application submittals each week.  Hoping that doubling down on the visibility of this message will help!

> Is there anything else we should know?

Would like to have this by Oct 1, 2022 as this is when our new FY fees will kick in and the fee increase - across the board - is SUBSTANTIAL.

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

Maybe V7 will fix this?  Capturing it here so we can be on the lookout.

DS permits are reflecting an ""Expires"" date (Folder Tab) even though the permit has *not* been reviewed or issued.  The date populating in this field is comping from the related Building Permit expiration date.  It should not be doing this.



> Is there anything else we should know?

My concern is that customers will go into their ABC Portal account and see that they have a DS permit with a future expiration and decide that means they can start working in the right of way (even though they most definitely can't/shouldn't).  This may already be happening ... we just don't have anyway of knowing.

> Name

Liane Conte

> What application are you using?

Other / Not Sure

> Describe the problem.

AMANDA programming for new Street Impact Fee for ATD. (not sure if this is considered a ""new project"" or a new feature in AMANDA)

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

We need to define the way AMANDA will be used for the Street Impact Fee. The ideal solution provides consistency in the application of the Street Impact Fee, accurate and timely information for applicants and reviewers, and is able to be reported efficiently on a recurring basis. 

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

See above.

> Users

ATD TDS staff; DSD transportation reviewers and staff who issue Building permits

> Sponsorship

Upal Barua

> Which Strategic Direction 2023 “Mobility” indicators would this new application impact?

['System efficiency and congestion']

> Which Austin Strategic Mobility Plan goals would this new application support?

['Commuter Delay – Reduce the amount of time workers spend traveling between home and work.', 'Travel Choice — Promote a balanced transportation network and the ability to make informed choices based on personal needs and preferences.']

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

The most basic solution would be to add a fee code or codes in AMANDA for the Street Impact Fee and the calculation would occur elsewhere. One key question is whether we want to program AMANDA to do the calculation. 

> Is there anything else we should know?

Fee collections beginning June 2022, but we know lead time is needed for AMANDA programming. We also need to define the work flow and data needs for reporting.

> How have other divisions/departments/cities addressed similar challenges? 

Austin Water has had an impact fee program for water and wastewater infrastructure for 30 years. They currently use AMANDA and AIMS for their reporting, which occurs quarterly for their Executive Team and twice a year as a public report for the Impact Fee Advisory Committee, which is mandated by the state for all impact fee programs. Jonathan Orenstein's group at AW interacts the most with DSD and AMANDA. I'll be reaching out to him to get more information about their processes.

**Notes on current workflow (Just Informational):**
Once a RW SE Folder gets created in AMANDA or via Portal, it goes into an Event Intake process as ""Pending""
Once an attempt of ""Accepted""/""Approved"" gets placed in the Event Intake Process (Assigned to the ROW Intake Group) the status becomes ""Pending "", Cancelled , Withdrawn, Rejected closes the process and folder.
It then creates a new Process called ""Event Review"" (50560) and inserts a fee that they delete anyways because it is paid by the time they have reviewed the folder.
Then the Permit is issued.

**Acceptance Criteria** 

- The Acceptance Criteria below applies to all DS and EX folders. 
- System needs to send a copy of the generated DS/EX Permit as an email to SiteSubPermits@austintexas.gov when users perform the following actions: 
-- When user clicks on email/print option in AMANDA Folder tab and selects DS or EX Permit document. 
-- When payment is made in the DS/EX folders and folder info 'Activate upon payment' is 'Yes'
-- When Extension Granted attempt is made in DS/EX folders. 

- Kim and Paloma say this used to be working but has stopped from around 10/1/2021. They also believed this may have been a batch, but not fully certain.

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim P., Ryan M.
**DTS Manager:** Tracy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System should send an email to rightofway@austintexas.gov on the 1st of every month containing the ATD Unpaid Fees Report for the previous month as an attachment. This needs to be done through batch process.
2. User should be able to generate the ATD Unpaid Fees Report manually from the Reports tab in AMANDA.
3. When a user manually generates the ATD Unpaid Fees Report, they should be able to provide From and To date ranges as a parameter.
4. The report should contain any unpaid fee, billed or unbilled from the following folders:
               - DS
               - EX
               - LC
               - PSM 
               - PSM
               - ECV Folder type with subtype ATD (ONLY)
               - GF folder type with subtype ATD (ONLY)
5. The report should primarily be sorted by Folder type and secondarily be sorted by subtype and by Bill number, with unbilled fees at the end of each of folder type
6. The report needs to contain the following columns in the defined order below: 
              - Folder type
              - Subtype 
              - FolderRSN 
              - Bill Number
              - Fee amount
7. The report should also contain totals by folder type, total billed fees by folder type and total unbilled fees by folder type

**Notes:**
- There is an existing report in the ATD library (56110). This query probably needs to be updated.
- If the existing fee report can't be updated to match the requirements, then once the new report has been created, the previous one (56110) needs to be removed. 
 
- Tracy has a lot of unpaid fee queries that may be useful

## Background

The city's yearly [Budgeting Process](https://financeonline.austintexas.gov/afo/afo_content.cfm?s=1&p=57), Department Fee schedules, Fee Logic/Workflow and Fee amounts have to be updated in AMANDA, if it has an applicable change, by September 30, 2022 and Go live date of October 01, 2022. With this being a large public facing project, it will require a Project Based approach to be delivered on time and to specs.

## Scope & Deliverables

_**In Scope:**_
-  Updating the AMANDA Budgeting Processes, Department Fee schedules, Fee Logic/Workflow and Fee amounts have to be updated in AMANDA, allowing staff to be able to Process approved FY23 fees in AMANDA.
- Budgeting Process, Department Fee schedules, Fee Logic/Workflow and Fee amounts have to be updated in AMANDA, if it has an applicable change, by September 30, 2022 and Go live on October 01, 2022.

_**Out of Scope:**_
- Fees on the fee schedule that are not, or should not be maintained in AMANDA are out of scope. 
- Any non-AMANDA solutions are also out of scope.

_**Constraints/RoadBlocks:**_
    - CTM's V7 Upgrade Project
    - Payment connections between AMANDA and CityBase
    - Testing payments on V7
    - Changes to FY22 fees must go live on Oct1 2022 only and cannot impact current PROD environment and its fees

## Desired Outcomes
-  All updated AMANDA Budgeting Processes, Department Fee schedules, Fee Logic/Workflow and Fee amounts will be UATd and verified properly prior to and after implementation.
- 2-3 week stabilization period for any changes
- All new fees and their changes are implemented properly and working on Oct 01, 2022
Impact this project can have, success metrics

## Timebox

All changes to fees must and will be implemented by September 30th, 2022 and go Live on October 01, 2022

**_Components:_**

Scoping: April - May
Technical requirements and documentation: May - June
System development: June - July
User acceptance testing: July - August

**Ready for Development?:** No

**StakeHolder:** Palmoa, Kim
**DTS Manager:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement the same solution DSD is using on other folders with smart housing (like BP)
- Before adding fees, the system validates folder infos to determine if Smart Housing adjustments are necessary
    - Info **50920** Has Smart Housing Been Approved - value must be Yes
    - Info **50921** Smart Housing Waiver Percent - Must not be null
- When the user inserts folder fees, the system adds an adjustment line, reducing the fee by the percentage in info **50921**
- When the smart housing info y/n is yes, the fees will auto-adjust themselves, similar to or exactly how DSD is automating this process. 
- **Only** the Inspection Fees are to be Waived, **NOT** the Permit Fees
- Per Kim, the DSD fees on the DS folder are auto-adjusting, so we need this logic applied to all folder. 

Auto waive SMART Housing fees

We would like to see if you’d be able to change the number for inspections in the conditions box on the EX permits to 512-660-0417 instead of the 512-974-7161 number for future permits that apply to our group.

Just a change to the Permit Reports and/or Pick Field language from the Folder Tab on EX and DS permits.

None.

For RW Valet Permits: 
- Currently, system updates the folder issue and expiry dates with dates that are provided in Process info of Valet Permitting Process (50630) (this is already working)
- System should update the folder status of RW folder to 'Active' when user makes an attempt of 'Update Issue and Expiry Dates' in Valet Permitting Process (50630) if the new expiry date of the folder is greater than the current date. (this needs to be implemented)   

For RW TURP Permits: 
- Currently, system changes the folder status to Active when fees are paid on an Expired Permit. (This currently works, but needs to be modified)
- System should change the folder status to Active when fees are paid on an Expired Permit only when expiry date of the folder is greater than the current date.

<!-- Email -->
<!-- paloma.amayo-ryan@austintexas.gov -->

### As the system, I need to email the folder applicant a copy of the permit when the bill is paid online. 
### As the system, when multiple bills are paid online, I need to email the folder applicant a copy of the permit for each folder/permit that was paid.

The Acceptance Criteria provided below applies to all DS, RW and EX folders: 

- When user pays for multiple invoices at the same time through the My Bills page on Portal, system must attach each permit paid to an email and send the email to the user. 
- Currently, system sends email for each invoice paid. But, only the first Permit document is sent multiple times. For example, if customer pays 6 invoices in one transaction, they get 6 copies of the first permit. 
- This functionality needs to be validated for different invoices from all folders.  


> What application are you using?

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

When applicants go to pay a bulk of invoices (I believe AMANDA allows people to pay up to 25 invoices in one transaction), they are allowed to pay all and all permits that were paid for become active but it only send the applicant the permit associated with the first invoice in the “queue” to pay. And it sends them as many copies as invoices. For example, if they pay 6 invoices in one transaction, they get 6 copies of that first permit. This is causing me to go back in and manually email those permits to applicants, thus, taking time away from other reviews. As events start picking up post-COVID shutdown, I see this being a persistent and growing problem as many of these permits usually get inputted, reviewed, and issued in bulk. 

> Is there anything else we should know?

This issue has been reported for DS and Parking permits.  I suspect it is effecting all folder types.  

Additional info regarding this has been forwarded to Kimberly P and Isabell P.  (I'm out of the office starting now through July 19th. Woohoo!)

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim
**DTS Manager:** TBD

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System should run a daily batch that checks to find LC folders that are 9 days away from expiry, and send an email to 'Right-Of-Way Contractor' of those LC folders if they are associated with any 'Active' status DS or EX folders. 
- System should send an email for each 'Active' DS or EX folder the Right of Way Contractor is associated with
- Text for the email
 
Subject: ROW Permit Expiration Notice

Dear Michael Miller *(Right-Of-Way Contractor People record First Name and Last Name)*, 

This email is to advise you that your permit # 2020-140984 EX *(Associated DS or EX Permit Number)* for 605 W 4TH ST *(Primary Property Address of associated DS or EX Permit)* will be expired due to your Concrete License 2007-123456 LC *(LC folder Permit number)* expiry on 12/31/2020 *(LC folder expiry date)* . To renew your Concrete License, email current versions of your documents to rightofway@austintexas.gov. For further information, click on the link below: 
https://austintexas.gov/page/right-way-contractors 

- System should run a daily batch that checks for LC folders that have a status of 'Expired'. 
- System should then check the People record of LC folders that have a type of 'Right-Of-Way Contractor' to see if they are part of any DS or EX folders 
- If there are any DS or EX folders for the People record that have a status of 'Active', system should change the folder status of these folders to 'Expired - License'
- System should also check daily if any LC folders have changed from 'Expired' to 'Active'
- If there are any LC folders that are now 'Active', system should change the corresponding DS and EX folders from 'Expired - License' to 'Active'  

**Note** - The status 'Expired-License' does not exist currently. It needs to be newly created.

**Stakeholders:** Kim, Paloma
**DTS Manager:** Tracy
**Acceptance Criteria:** 
- A new folder info needs to be created for DS folders with name 'Driveway Sidewalk Inspector', similar to Excavation Inspector (76155) info field from EX folders 
- The new info field 'Driveway Sidewalk Inspector' should be of Pick type. 
- The values for the new info field should be inspector names that come from GIS Map layer 'Service Areas -> DSD Street Inspector areas' 
- System should update the assigned user of the following processes when the info field is updated with a value
     - 200 Pre-Construction (50113)
     - 201 Sidewalk Prepour (50115)
     - 202 Final Sidewalk (50135)
     - 203 Driveway Prepour (50120)
     - 204 Final Driveway (50130) 
     - 205 Curb/Gutter Prepour (50127)
     - 206 Final Curb/Gutter (50129)
     - 207 DS TCO Occupancy (50132)
     - 208 DS TCO Occupancy (50133)
- The assigned user should be the corresponding user account of the inspector value chosen in the 'Driveway/Sidewalk Inspector' info field
- System should update the assigned user for a process only if the process does not have a Started Date
- System should update the assigned user only for DS folders 
- System should allow the user to type in a value and save it for the new info field 'Driveway/Sidewalk Permit', and then update the assigned user for the processes if a matching User Account is found. For example, if the user types in John Smith in Info field Driveway/Sidewalk Inspector, system must look to see if there is a John Smith user account. If found, system should assign the processes to the John Smith user account.

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Izzy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- On process 50860 Excavation Final
- New process attempt: Deferred 
- Deferred attempt requires attempt comment before saving
- When Deferred attempt is saved, the system updates the process status to Deferred

> Describe the problem.

AMANDA request:
I’d like to add an attempt or process to the EX folder (process tab) that would allow us to indicate when final restoration has been deferred.  The catch is that it shouldn’t impact the status or fees or really anything else … or at least I don’t think it should.

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

AMANDA will house deferred restoration agreements.  All impacted parties (i.e. Inspections, ROW Permitting, and Customer/Application) will have formal documentation in the system of record.

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim
**DTS Manager:** TBD

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Info field 'Number of after hours of service' (Info code 75947) should be removed from any RW folder (Currently exists, needs to be removed)
- Users should be able to see a new info field 'Rate if metered (in $ per parking meter)' (No infocode exists, needs to be added) in RW folders of subtype Parking Spaces and worktype Load/Unload
- System should insert the Parking Space Permit Fee (50170) when 'Approved' attempt is made in Parking Parking Review Process (50662) in RW folder of subtype Parking Spaces and worktype Load/Unload 
- System should also create a bill when the Parking Space Permit Fee (50170) is inserted in Right of Way folder of subtype Parking Spaces (Fee code exists, logic needs to be updated)
- The amount for Parking Space Permit Fee should be calculated as follows:
Metered Fee = Value in Info Rate if metered (in $ per parking meter)   **X**   Value in 'Number of Days' Info field (Info Code 75390)  **X**   16   **X**   Number of 'Parking Spaces : Meter Number' Rows in Property & Street Information Freeform

Parking Space Permit Fee (50170) = Metered Fee + Unmetered Fee

**Note** 
- '**X**' in the payment logic above denotes multiplication
- Values 16 and 3.20 are variables and may change in the future. These should not be hard coded and should be added to a lookup table (Tracy mentioned this was lookup table 5025)
- The logic for inserting the fee may currently exist. If it does, it needs to be updated or removed to account for this new change in logic

Hi all, 2022 024861 000 00 EX was in Application Incomplete since 02/22/22. Yesterday it went into Internet Pending and now it's showing an ""In Date"" of 02/22/22. 

Last year, we corrected the system so that the ""In Date"" reflected the date that the Applicant *actually* submitted the request (as opposed to the date that they began the application).

At some point within the past couple of months this fix was lost.  This causes data infidelity and invalidates our permitting measurements.

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

Customers must be able to pay fees on permits, EVEN WHEN those permits are in a ""Rejected"" or ""Closed"" status.  (This was possible at one point in time but apparently is not right now.)  This is resulting in uncollected revenue.

> Is there anything else we should know?

The Status of the Mobility Bond Review Process (51093) defaults to closed no matter the attempt result.  This happens on Small Cell Permit and ROW Permit Folders.  On Land Management Folders the Status drop down reflects the result. This is a manual change to the drop down each time. This function is important for the Small Cell Permit Folders due to the fact that the applicant receives a Master Comment Report and the status needs to be reflected.

Cleanup ""Insert and run procedure"" menu on RW, DS, and EX folders - part two.  Presently working to remove unnecessary fees.  As a next step would like to *ADD* fees which should be in the ""Insert and run procedure"" menu (that are presently only able to be pulled up via the Insert function).  And then would like to standardized the naming of fees across all of these menus.

This will ensure we are assessing fees accurately and consistently, benefiting our customers and our department.  (Avoids over or under collection.)

We add fees via the Insert menu but that requires knowing the fee name or code.  Some fees are named so similarly that it can be difficult to discern which is the correct one to assess.

**From Izzy**

_regarding an extension for #2021-160444 RW. The dates on the permit are not updating after the extension process has been completed in AMANDA. The status of the permit is not updating when we send the copy of the permit to the applicant. I experimented with the activate upon payment field on the info tab, but it had no effect. The status in AMANDA is essential for PLAs when running a conflict check. Also, if an inspector looks in AMANDA, then they could potentially issue a violation to the contractor for working without an active permit._

Hello Everyone!

 

As you may be aware, Amanda is going through an upgrade to a new version (from v6 to v7). As part of the project, the Amanda application (v7) will be connected to our current (AB+C) Portal (aka Portal II); and all functionality will need to be tested.

The project team has completed unit testing and we’d like your help testing this further and letting us know of any bugs/ issues so they can be fixed prior to full UAT (user acceptance testing) planned in January 2022.

 

Here is the new Portal II TEST link that is connected to v7 Test database.

Important : You will need to go thru the registration process as this is a new portal link. Please reach out to me or Sam Dolling (for DSD) for any assistance with log in or access issues.

Here is the Amanda application (back office) v7 Test link-

Could you’ll please test this by Dec 17, 2021 and email your feedback with details and screenshots to me?

 

Thank you all so much for your assistance and support!!

## [TURP](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/data--technology-services-5caf7dc6ecad11531cc418ef/issues/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/6564)

### Remove the following functionality:
- [ ] The current fee insertion and work type selection triggers for RW-TURP folders need to be removed as they are all going to change (#4469, #6322) . Provided below are some places where these triggers have been identified. Make sure Extension Fee inserts based on Property & Street Information irrespective of the WorkType: PVT Long Term

- [ ] Info field Event Start Date (75980) and Event End Date (75985) determine appropriate work type for the folder. This functionality needs to be removed.
- [ ] Any functionality based on Info field Project Sponsor (76765) needs to be removed.


### Create new fee logic for the fees provided below:

- [ ] **TURP New Permit Fee**

- Applies only when sub type is NOT 'Franchised Utility -Gas Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Other Electric Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Telecommunication/Cable Utility'.
- This fee needs to be added when a new application is created either from portal or back office
- Fee needs to be added only if folder Info 'Emergency' (#6641) is answered 'No'.
-Applicant must pay this fee before folder status updates to Internet Pending


- [ ] **TURP Extension Permit Fee**

- Currently the system inserts TURP ROW fees for extensions when attempt 'Extension Granted' is made in Permit Extension Process (50680).
- System needs to insert the TURP Permit Extension Fee at this trigger along with other fees.
- Applies only when work type is NOT 'Franchised Utility -Gas Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Other Electric Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Telecommunication/Cable Utility'.



----
## [EX](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/data--technology-services-5caf7dc6ecad11531cc418ef/issues/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/6565)

### Remove the following functionality:
_The following fee procedures and logic need to be removed for the EX fees:_

- [ ] The Excavation/Concrete Permit fee - Transport (50348) is inserted when application is created through Portal. This fee insertion needs to be removed.


### Create new fee logic for the fees provided below:

- [ ] **Excavation Permit Fee - New**
- Applies only when worktype is NOT 'Franchised Utility -Gas Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Other Electric Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Telecommunication/Cable Utility'.
- This fee needs to be added when a new application is created either from portal or back office.
- This fee should be added only if Info field 'Emergency' (#6641) and Info field 'Secondary' (#6321) are answered 'No'
- Applicant must pay this fee before folder status updates to Internet Pending.

- [ ] **Excavation Application Fee - Secondary - $95**
- Applies only when work type is NOT 'Franchised Utility -Gas Utility', Franchised Utility - Other Electric Utility', Franchised Utility - Telecommunication/Cable Utility'.
- Fee needs to be added only if folder Info 'Secondary' (#6321) is answered 'Yes' and Folder Info 'Emergency' is answered 'No'.
- This fee needs to be added when a new application is created either from portal or back office
- Applicant must pay this fee before folder status updates to Internet Pending



- [ ] **Excavation Application Fee - Extension - $175**
- This fee should be inserted manually when user navigates to fee tab and clicks Add->Insert.
- The manually inserted fee should be inserted with the fee amount of $175.
- Applies only when subtype is NOT 'Franchised Utility -Gas Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Other Electric Utility', 'Franchised Utility - Telecommunication/Cable Utility'.

## As an OSE reviewer, I'd like the system to auto-create the RW Street Event folder when a certain info is clicked 'Yes' on the SE folder. I'd also like the common folder details/info to copy down to the child RW folder. 

**Stakeholder:** Maria A
**DTS Manager:** Nate

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- If any of the three infos in the ""Right of Way Details"" section of the SE is selected it should create the ""ACE ATD Review"" process and cause it to be reviewed
- Same goes for if any of the three infos in the ""Right of Way Details"" section of an ACE Parent folder (SE) is selected it should create an RW Street Event Folder (at least the shell)
- Tier Level section in the info tab of the SE folder should be the same as above and required  for Tiers 1 and 2
- It should copy over the information from the other folder and insert the ""ACE ATD Review"" process
- If any of the three infos in the ""Right of Way Details"" section is selected it should insert the ""ACE ATD Review"" process
- When the RW SE Folder is created from selecting any of the three infos in the ROW Details section on the SE, the folder should start in a **""Pending""** status
- It should also have the ""ACE ATD Review"" Process inserted automatically
- The ""ACE ATD Review"" Process when inserted will need to have an attempt result of ""Create Child Permit(s)"" (Copy Building Review Process workflow)
- When the attempt of ""Create Child Permit(s)"" is entered it should trigger the process info tab to populate the necessary infos to be filled (See below for infos wanted):

From RW SE folder:
Event Type
Parking Reservations
ACE Application submitted

**Concern** When they were checking the Building Review, nothing from the SE Folder info copies over only the Description and Title and whatever Process infos that are in the ""Create Child"" Attempt
From the Building Review Process

**Old Notes:**
Will you be using any aspect of the ROW? - If the value is anything other than 'No', create an OSE folder. 
    - Ideally this would only work if the folder status is 'In Review'
    - Ideally this would only work if the ACE folder info 'Tier' value is a 1 or a 2.

The Acceptance Criteria provided below only applies to folders of type GF with subtype ATD and no work type: 

- During Folder creation, system must insert TCP Review fee and ATD Tech Surcharge in the folder (Being implemented as part of #7682).
- System must also check to see if the Info field 'COS Partner Department?' on the GF folder is answered 'Yes' (#7465).
- If COS Partner Department is 'Yes', system should automatically pay the TCP Review Fee and the ATD Tech Surcharge. 
- Payment type should be recorded as 'Cost of Service'.
- The stamp user for the auto-payment should be AMANDA.

## Background
Construction related road closure permits often give the contractor an approved timeframe for closing the road. For example, ATD may give a contractor 7 calendar days to perform 2 days of work. As such, it is impossible to know when a contractor is actually in the right of way. This hinders ATD’s ability to coordinate activity in the Right of Way, and it impacts the traveling public’s ability to plan their routes. 

Due to the nature of construction, giving the contractor a ‘window’ is necessary, so we must design a solution that allows for us to continue giving them a window and will also allow us to gather data from the contractor on-site, when they are closing and re-opening the Right of Way. 

## Scope & Deliverables
**This project includes:**
- Updating internal permitting workflows to include processes that will make real-time road closure data possible.
- Building a customer-facing solution for permit holders that will allow them to easily notify ATD when they begin a road closure, and when they end it. 
- Designing the real-time road closure data to conform with Work Zone Data Exchange specifications.
- Publishing this data for public use, especially for existing public mapping tools like Google Maps and Waze

## Desired Outcomes
Success for this project means city staff, permit analysts, right of way coordinators, and the public will have access to real-time permitted road closure information. This will reduce the amount of permitting conflicts in the Right-of-Way, which, when they happen, have adverse effects on the contractor’s ability to perform their work and can cause unnecessary traffic congestion. This will also allow the public to better plan their routes and avoid delays caused by permitted road closures. 

We also hope that by openly publishing this data, companies that provide mapping products will be able to integrate this data into their product and provide their users with real-time closure data. 


## Timebox
This is a complex project with heavy scoping/analysis needs. While we have already performed much of the scoping, we will need to refresh the analysis when the project is picked up. 

**Expected Timeline:**

- Scoping & Analysis: 1 Month
- Review Possible Solutions: 1 Month
- Writing Requirements and Acceptance Criteria: 2 Weeks
- Development: 1-2 Months
- Testing: 1 Month
- Training Staff & Permit Holders: 1 Month
- Total Duration From Start to Go-Live: **6 Months**

<!-- paloma.amayo-ryan@austintexas.gov -->

**Acceptance Criteria**

- There needs to be a new attachment type added to PSM folders called 'Application'. 
- This new attachment type must be visible both in the portal and the Back Office. 


- User should be able to submit attachments through the portal after the permit application has been submitted
- This currently happens in the DS and EX folders. PSM needs to have the same functionality. 

- When adding a new People record to a PSM folder in the back office, user must be able to choose from all available People types. Currently only the Applicant option is shown. 
- This works correctly in RW-TURP folder, for reference. 

- Info code 86110 should be changed to: Historic Designation Approval - 6th Street from IH-35 to Lavaca Street. 



> What application are you using?

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

The Public Space Management (PSM) folder in AMANDA + ABC Portal needs a few tweaks.  (Some of these may be bugs not identified during original development of folder.)  PSM needs are:
- Add an Attachment option for ""Application""
- Allow portal users to attach documents after application submittal
- Allow other people records to be added to the Folder tab
- Correct the boundaries listed under the Historic Designation field in the portal application

![image.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/5e8dfbfabf171441c3a5684e/d5fca065-ca16-4e12-9055-f165f68b2b74)


> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

Our team *and* our customers will encounter a more functional/efficient PSM folder.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

For the attachment issues, customers must email the Permit Analyst who then attaches documents on their behalf.  (Which is burdensome when you consider the fact that the customers rarely know which Permit Analyst to email.)

For the other people records there is no work around so we are collecting incomplete data.

For the historic designation issues there is no work around so customers are seeing incorrect information (which contradicts the correct info we have published online).

> Is there anything else we should know?

The sooner the better as we are expecting an increase in PSM applications over the coming months.  (A number of businesses are participating in the temporary ""Shop the Block"" program and hope to transition to our Sidewalk Cafe/Street Patio permit option before that program expires.)

An internal city audit performed in 2018 identified the need for ROW’s traffic control inspection group to better prioritize the inspections they perform. On an average day there are over 4,000 active Right-of-Way permits that are eligible for a traffic control inspection. This number far outweighs ATD’s available resources to provide inspections, resulting in a need to prioritize the inspections we choose to perform. 

Right of Way Management has identified key metrics that will allow us to rate inspection priorities based on things such as location, proximity to critical infrastructure, project impact, and the contractor’s history of traffic control violations. 

## Scope & Deliverables
The scope includes developing automated tools that will score permits based on key metrics, and provide the traffic control inspections group with a prioritized list of inspections. Phase 2 of this project may include a dashboard for the inspectors. 

## Desired Outcomes
Success for this project means the traffic control inspectors are better able to identify the highest priority inspections, resulting in our ability to correct deficiencies in our highest impact areas. Deficiency correction provides safer roadways, and better traffic flow.

Austin Energy folks (Lucas Haydon) are attempting to make changes on ROW permits in AMANDA including work taking place and dates when they should not have that access. I spoke with Paloma Amayo-Ryan who has said that this has been an issue in the past but appears to be increasing again.

As soon as possible. This is causing info to be erased or altered on ROW permits and this can create issues if not caught early.

- Option 1: Reuse existing processes where they exist, and update the attempt types...
- Option 2: Create a new process to use across all permit types

We're unsure which of these options is best; we'd like to ask Subha to analyze the existing processes and make a recommendation or at least present findings to help us make this decision. Vish said he can work with Subha on this and assist with documentation.

- Info type: Boolean
- Default Info Value: 'No'
- Info should be Required for Insert and Required for Issue (Is mandatory for folder creation & issuance)
- The new Info field must be displayed on portal as a mandatory field for EX and RW-TURP applications
- The folder info needs to be a part of 'Project Information' Info group, same as #6321

  -  The EX folder has a link on the infos page on portal (Subha will look at the code)

  -  The Help text is below:

> EMERGENCY OPERATIONS means operations or repairs of facilities to prevent imminent harm to the health, safety, or welfare of persons or property.

**Request information**
> What application are you using?

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

Add an ""Emergency?"" Yes/No field to the Info Tab of the RW - TURP folders.  (Both in AMANDA and Portal.)  This field would mirror the one already established on the EX folders.

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

ROW will use this field to accurately calculate the new permit fees (to be effective 10/01/21) assessed to City Departments.  This will also be a valuable field for other reporting needs.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

We capture a TURP's emergency status using the Priority field on the Folder Tab.  This is being done on the back end by Analysts.  Moving this to the Info Tab will allow it to be entered by the *applicants*.

> Is there anything else we should know?

Yes, 10/01/21.

> What application are you using?

AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

UC Folder Info Tab:
Will the Facility Owner/Project Sponsor info field but updated with the same info as the EX + RW?

We would like to also add the CIP - Yes or No info field.  (This would function the same as the addition we've made to the EX and RW folders.)

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

ROW will be able to run a report that indicates whether or not a UC is tied to a City project and if so, which City department it is connected with AND whether or not it is a CIP funded project.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

We have none.  Presently we do not collect or report on this data.  Once we begin feeing for UC review, this will be essential.

> Is there anything else we should know?

October 1st, for compliance with the anticipated new fee schedule.

Capture Right-of-Way permitting metrics data, and 2.) Create all AMANDA reports requested by ATD Executive Management. 

## Background

ATD Executive Management has requested a series of AMANDA reports related to Right-of-Way permitting and has identified 4 major reporting metrics. Unfortunately the majority of the data required for this reporting does not currently exist. 

## Scope & Deliverables
There will be two (2) phases of development. 

- Phase 1: Update AMANDA permitting folders so the necessary data can be captured.
- Phase 2: Create the reports for our stakeholders.


Desired   Outcome | Deliverables
-- | --
Staff   can create and view data related to permitting turnaround times. | All permit folders updated to   capture dependable application and issuance timestamps.
Staff   can create and view data related to permitting review cycles. | All permit folders workflows are   updated to capture review cycle data.
Staff   can create and view data related to permitting review duration. | All permit folders workflows are   updated to capture data related to duration of reviews.
Staff   can create and view data related to permitting review deficiencies. | All permit folders workflows are   updated to capture data related to permitting deficiencies.
Staff   has access to on-demand reporting for Right-of-Way permitting metrics. | Custom AMANDA permitting metrics   reports are available in the ATD AMANDA Custom Report Library, which is   available to all ATD staff.
Staff   understands the new enhancements and how to use them. | Employee training is provided to   Right-of-Way management.





## Timebox

----
**Stakeholders: Isabelle P., Paloma A.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System should update the assigned user for the following processes when the info field Excavation Inspector (76155) is updated 
               - Backfill (50805)
               - Concrete (Paving) (50810)
               - Concrete (Misc) (50855)
               - Pre bore (50815)
               - Consultation (50820)
               - Asphalt (Paving) (50830)
               - Plate (50835)
               - Excavation final (50860)
- The assigned user updated should correspond to the Inspector value chosen in Info field Excavation Inspector (76155). For example, if excavation inspector is chosen to be John Smith, the processes mentioned above should be assigned to the John Smith User account.  
- System should update the assigned user only if the processes mentioned above do not have a Started Date 
- System should update the assigned user only for EX folders
- Excavation Inspector Info field (76155) currently allows a user to type in a value (since it is a Pick type info field). System should look for a matching inspector user account and if found, assign the processes mentioned above to the assigned user. For example, if the user types in John Smith in Info field Excavation Inspector, system must look to see if there is a John Smith user account. If found, system should assign the processes to the John Smith user account.  

**Note:**
- Currently the info and assigned users are updated when GIS info is pulled for the folder. The implementation of this functionality should not affect the GIS pull.

Sometimes the attachments go to non related folders.

**Stakeholders:** Kim, Paloma
**DTS Manager:** Nate

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When the portal applicant clicks 'Submit' on an EX application, the attachments are added to the parent folder
- When the applicant clicks 'Submit' and multiple EX folder are created, the additional folders are made children of the parent folder. 
    - This will allow the users to easily find the attachment by clicking the 'View' button. 
- We need a solution/feature that informs the user, while looking at a child folder, that there are attachments available on the parent folder. 



- Reviewers will be able to access all of the files that are attached to the EX permit during the initial submittal phase, to avoid searching for the attachments on other folders other than the EX folder
- Reviewers will be able to access the attachments from the intitial submittal phase or any added after the submittal phase on any folders or child folders related to the EX Permit


----------

Description From Paloma:

> ""When applicants submit for an EX they are able to select multiple streets to be impacted and AMANDA will separate that in to the necessary permits by street name.  However, it appears that AMANDA is only adding the attachments to one of those permits at random.  It’s not the biggest deal in the world but if there was a way to straighten out that kink it would be nice.
> 
> E.g., 3 or 4 files are attached that are meant to apply for the entire application. We need these files attached to all related folders. This only needs to happen upon initial submittal. The folders do not need to stay in sync after submittal. This enables permit analysts to quickly check if required documents have been provided.
> 
> Sometimes will be parent-child folders, sometimes the folders will not be connected.
> 
> CTM may flag this approach because file records will be duplicated in the AMANDA DB.
> 
> *Migrated from [atd-amanda #72](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-amanda/issues/72)*

Requirements:

- Attachments added during the initial submittal phase are added to the main folder instead of any child or related folders
- Attechments added during the initial submittal phase or after need to be accessible from any child or related folder

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Public Portal users should be able to view and make payments on DS folders with status  'Void'

**Notes:**
- We tested this online; DS payments cannot be made when folder status is VOID. (5/3/21)
- Surya mentioned the ability to view folders in portal is controlled based off lookup table 99052. She believed adding two new rows here for these statuses should fix the issue. 
- Can the functionality be modified to only view Withdrawn or Void folders ONLY if they have outstanding fees? Need estimate from developers. 
    - If this is possible, I'd (Tracy) prefer it be developed in a separate issue.

Description: Application Incomplete Issue: When a portal applicant starts an application but does not finish it, a folder for the permit is created in AMANDA with the status ‘Application Incomplete’.

This project also includes identifying a business intelligence tool for permitting managers to ingest, analyze, and report on permitting data.

## Background
This project began with a finding from the City Auditor related to traffic control inspections; we were asked to implement better methods for prioritizing and organizing the inspections being performed. These new methods depend heavily on permitting data which isn’t easily accessible in it’s current database. Permitting and inspection managers also need more access to this data, and to have the ability to perform independent queries and produce their own custom reports.

## Scope & Deliverables
The project scope includes identifying and publishing Right-of-Way permitting data on the City’s Open Data Portal. Also in scope is identifying and possibly implementing a business intelligence tool for permitting managers to work with and report on this data.

"538","Needs Scoping","ROWMAN6 Deliverables (Needs cleanup)","Workgroup: ROW, Service: Product, Epic, Project: ROWMAN Ph 6, Product: AMANDA","Phase 6 of the ROWMAN Replacement Project will develop new portal features that allow Excavation and Right-of-Way permit holders to add information to permit folders that already exist in AMANDA, and are pending a customer submittal. It will also explore solutions for enabling external reviewer features that would allow our external partners to provide review comments without using AMANDA. 

## Background
The AMANDA permitting system used by ATD to manage Right of Way permitting has been upgraded recently to auto-create Excavation (EX) and Right-of-Way-Use (RW) permits when requirements for needing a permit have been met during another, related review. For example, when a Small Cell Permit (SCP) is approved the applicant is required to then apply for the EX and RW permits needed to perform the work. Currently the customer must start those online applications from scratch, which includes providing us with information we already have. With this upgrade the EX and RW permits will create themselves after the SCP is approved, and the customer will be able to pick up the already existing permits online and finish applying for them. 

In addition to auto-creating permit folders from Small Cell Permit reviews, we'd like to expand this feature to include General Permitting reviews and Utility Coordination reviews. This feature is especially valuable to Capital Improvement Project Managers; automating the creation of related Right of Way permit folders will enable to project managers to stop having to manually create each permit and delegate the permitting tasks to the CIP contractor(s). 

Some Right of Way permits include multidisciplinary reviews with internal and external stakeholders. Currently there is no feature to allow our external stakeholders to provide review comments directly to the associated AMANDA review folder. We we explore possible solutions that would enable those stakeholders to participate in the multidisciplinary reviews without needing AMANDA access. 

## Scope & Deliverables
Project Deliverables Include:
- Contractor self-assign features for EX and RW permit applications
- Automated child folder creation for UC and GP reviews
- Scoping solutions for external review features

## Desired Outcomes
Success for this project looks like:
- Auto-creation of Right of Way permits from their parent GP, UC, or SCP review.
-	Customer notification when an EX and/or RW permit requirement has been identified during another related review, with clear instructions for how to finish the application.
-	New AMANDA Portal features to allow the customer to find their pending application, provide missing details, and submit for staff review.
- A clear direction or solution for our external reviewer needs. 
 
## Timebox
The development for this project was performed in 2019 after which the project was put on hold due to re-prioritization. When this project is picked up again we will need to perform user acceptance testing, and training. Time to completion is around 3 months.

## Background

ATD’s online Right of Way permit applications include a map selector tool that allows customers to use a map to identify the properties and Right of Way they wish to add to their application. This tool is capable of more features that we aren’t currently utilizing, which if used would provide greater value to customers and permit analysts. 

## Scope & Deliverables
New map selector features that we intend to develop include:
-	Copying properties from already existing applications to a new application, with the ability to edit before submitting
-	Selecting individual parking spaces, as opposed to selecting a block range and manually providing the parking meter number further in the application. 
-	Integration of existing GIS layers that will increase the applicant’s ability to self-coordinate their activity
- Integration of CIP data that will allow CIP Project Managers to import CIP data into the permit application.

## Desired Outcomes
Success for this project looks like:
-	Applicants saving time during application submittal
-	Applicants being able to identify Right-of-Way conflicts before permit submittal
-	Better parking space management across ATD
-	Increased coordination with CIP projects

## Timebox
This project is currently in the backlog, so an exact delivery date is not available at this time. We estimate that from start to completion, this project will take 3 months to deliver.

Email from Evelyn:

> Good afternoon Jamie,
> 
> My name is Evelyn Powers and I am a Project Coordinator with Right of Way Management. 
> 
> I’ve had a few discussions with Public Works and the Office of Real Estate regarding vacated streets and how Right of Way can have access to that data. We envision updating a GIS layer in one of the tools, ROWPACT, we use to reflect which streets have been vacated. ROWPACT is a GIS map which houses all kinds of information (ex: conflicting permits, jurisdiction, TCAD information, and street classification just to name a few).
> We are interested in the street layer, which shows street classification, being able to display if a street is Vacated/Private. Please see the screen shots below for how we imagine that working.
> 
> We would like you to be part of the conversation we have with your counterpart at Office of Real Estate (where the vacated street information is housed), Millicent McDonald. There seems to be some confusion as to whom would facilitate this ask. Our hope is, that by you being part of the conversation, you can bridge some of the gaps we are having, as you will “speak the same language” as them. I don’t think Office of Real Estate is quite understanding our ask since they believe the street layer would be managed by CTM. We are not asking for Office of Real Estate to make the changes, but to provide Public Works (who does manage that layer – Bryan Thompson) the GIS information they would need.
> 
> Office of Real Estate (Melissa Torres and Millicent McDonald) also mentioned that GIS has an upcoming enterprise update in the next few years and we could make the change then. Our need is a bit more urgent then that, due to Right of Way having already incorrectly permitted and charged applicants to occupy streets that have been vacated. With this new street classification being added to our arsenal, the margin for error would be significantly decreased. 
> 
> I appreciate any help or guidance you can offer on this, and if you need any clarification please let me know.

- Test RSNs: 12384690, 11815436

**What Happened:**
✔ System emailed permit applicant w/ instruction
- _Is it possible to make the URL shorter?_
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49930868/99290713-4787e280-2804-11eb-8f2f-d175545faf58.png)

✔ System updated 'Years Paid For' info to 1

✔ System updated the folder status updated to 'Pending Payment'

❌ System removed all existing fees from the fee tab (accountbillfee)
    - The fee payment records are still there (accountpayment)

❌ System double charged; two identical sets of fees were inserted & billed (RSN 11815436)

❌ User logs into portal to pay fees
- RSN 11815436 was not available in 'My Bills' or 'My Permits' - _why?_
- RSN 12384690 was not available in 'My Bills', but I could open it via 'My Permits'. 
    - I could see the outstanding fees but was not given the option to pay it

✔ I was able to make a payment on the double fees from backend (RSN 11815436))

✔ System updated folder status to 'Active'

✔ System updated folder expiration date correctly

### ➕ New Requirement: I'd like the system to send the folder applicant a confirmation email. Template below:


**Subject Line:** SCP [Permit-Number] - Renewal Complete
- _Example: SCP 2017-136986 - Renewal Complete_



**Body:**
Your Small Cell Permit has been renewed for 1 year and will expire on [folder expiration date].

**Enhancements Needed**
- Enable searching by street name instead of address
- Change language from 'Parcel' to 'Address'
- Add help on Parcel feature to make it obvious that it's optional

**Stakeholders:** Michael Jones, Deborah Fonseca (DSD)
**DTS Manager:** Tracy

**NOTE:** In DSD's backlog in Service Now. **INC0086688**

### Solution:
- On DS folders, process tab
    - All inspection processes used by Mike Jones' inspectors
    - **Process names & codes need to be identified and documented**
- And for these attempt results: Pass, Fail, Failed / No Work

**Pass Attempt:**
1. The inspector (user) saves attempt 'Pass'
2. The system emails the folder people Right-of-Way Contractor 
    - Email template TBD, awaiting template from Mike
3. The system inserts the email content as a new record on the Comment tab.
    - As is doing on the BP folder when finaled. 
    -

**Fail or Failed/No Work Attempts:**
1. The inspector inserts one or multiple process deficiencies
2. The inspector saves attempt 'Fail' or 'Failed/No Work'
3. The system emails the folder people Right-of-Way Contractor 
    - Email template TBD, awaiting template from Mike
4. The system inserts the email content as a new record on the Comment tab.
    - As is doing on the BP folder when finaled.

**Note**
- In the scenario when multiple inspections are performed on the same permit, we would only want to send 1 email with both results. 
    - Example: Driveway Pre-pour & Sidewalk pre-pour are performed in one visit. Both inspection results should be included in one email to the Right-of-Way contractor. 
- This solution won't be effective if the Right-of-Way contractor record doesn't have an email address. This will need to be done with Paloma's staff.

## Background
The [current AMANDA user portal](https://www.austintexas.gov/page/austin-build-connect-abc) is using outdated security technology that has consistently caused critical performance and security issues. It also limits our ability to develop new features. This upgrade will fix all security issues and provide us with a robust platform that will be able to grow with our business needs.

## Scope & Deliverables
The project scope is limited to duplicating all current portal features, and only includes one new feature: a permitting wizard. Currently there are two ‘Apply for Permits’ links, so we want to condense it to one.

## Timebox
This project started in October 2020, and is expected to go-live in January 2021.
-	1/4/21: Begin user acceptance testing.
-	1/11/21: Begin user training
-	1/25/21: Go-live

**Questions:**
- Are the fees the system inserts during folder insert providing value, or are they deleting them? 
- At what point in the real-life TIA workflow are fees collected? How many times are fees collected?

### From the Customer:

_It looks like AMANDA stopped generating “estimated start and completion date” on the permits. It can be added but wanted to advise as it can populate an error message without them being entered. It looks like it started at the tail end of the day on the 17th of this month, at lease for excavation permits. Attached are a couple screen shots of permits with the option indicated and without. Please let me know if you need anything else._

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim

**Acceptance Criteria:**
Assuming user is logged in to Portal 
1. User should be able to upload attachments to portal pertaining to their applications 
2. System should be able to accept attachments based on system defined attachment types 
3. When user uploads an attachment, they system should insert a folder comment.
4. System should be able to assign the folder comment to the assignee who is handling this process. (Web application acceptance) (process code: 70,000)
5. System should  display comment at the bottom of task list for the user the comment is assigned to.

Note: comments appear under the folder and Not under the process. comments get assigned under each individual reviewer. There is also a common folder where the comments can appear which Paloma reviews. 

Questions for Paloma: What is the status of folder when waiting on attachment? Internet Pending? What is the name/type of the attachment?

=------------------ --------------
Notification when attachments are added. 

ROW routinely asks customers to add documentation to the ABC Portal. Customers constantly add documents after the initial submission. Currently ROW asks customers to notify ROW but that doesn't happen consistently. Customers end up very unhappy.

**Stakeholders:** Joan M., Nazlie S, Nathan A, Sangeeta, Amber

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- TBD

**Notes for Scoping:**
- Which folders need this feature? (Zoning, Site Plan, any others?)
- What logic will the folder use to know when to create a child permit? 
- What status should the TIA folder be created in?
- What task/process will be used to assign review to TIA reviewer? 
       - Who should it assign to?
- What information, if any, will be copied from parent folders into TIA folder?
- What actions need to be done in the parent folder when a child TIA is created? (folder status change, etc.)



-----

**Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.**
New TIA folders will show up on my AMANDA task list for review. 


**Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.**
Currently we manually insert the folder ourselves, then we enter the info again in our TIA Primary List spreadsheet.


**What else should we know?**
This feature request came about during a requirements meeting for the TIA Module project. The requester is Joan M with the TIA group. 

**Acceptance criteria**

**Currently, we're unable to do this because the DS folder doesn't capture when we receive the permit request, or how long it take us to perform a review.**
**- To be scoped with #1994**

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim
**DTS Manager:** Tracy

**Acceptance Criteria**
- When a DS folder is created, system should automatically insert a new process ""DS Permitting Review""
- User should be able to make the following attempts on the DS Permitting Review Process: Start Review, Complete
- Attempt date should automatically be recorded when user makes an attempt in DS Permitting Review Process (this is a default AMANDA feature)
- Process status of DS Permitting Review process should be updated to Start Review when Start Review attempt is made
- Process status of DS Permitting Review process should be updated to Complete when Complete attempt is made
- System should insert the process Ended Date in DS Permitting Review process when attempt Complete is made
- DS Permitting Review Process should be mandatory for folder Issuance



Note: New Folder process to be created for DS review. List to be used “ROW INTAKE GROUP” 
 - Changes should not affect Post payment process. 


### Current Workflow
_As explained by Tracy_

1. DS permits are primarily created as part of the DSD development process, and are children of a parent BP folder
2. DS child permits, when created, default to folder status 'Pending'
3. DS customer may not initiate contact with ROW to get the permit until many months/year after the folder was created
    - For this reason, the folder In Date does not represent when the customer initiated permitting with ROW
4. When the customer initiates permitting with ROW, the permit analyst updates the folder tab, the people tab, the info tab, and the fee tab. No folder processes are used in the current workflow. 
5. When permit review is complete/approved, fees are billed and paid. 
6. The permit is issued after payment of fees
7. Due to this workflow, ROW is unable to answer these questions:
    - When did the customer initiate permitting with ROW?
    - How long did it take ROW to perform the DS review?


------

Description: Currently the DS folder is not configured to capture when the PLA receives a request to process the permit, so performance measure tracking is not possible.

- Updates apply only to RW-Street Event

- When updates are saved to the folder info tab, the system will insert the correct value in info 'Number of Blocks', it will overwrite the existing value with the correct value.

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Ryan M., Kim
**DTS Manager:** Tracy Linder

**Further Info:**
- 'Return to Work' is only used by staff when 'Project Suspension' has previously been saved
- When 'Project Suspension' attempt is saved, the folder could be in any valid status
- When 'Project Suspension' attempt is saved, the folder status updates to 'Suspended'
- When 'Return to Work' is saved, staff expects the folder status to update to whatever folder status was in place when the 'Project Suspension' attempt was saved
    - Currently the system updates folder status to 'Active', which creates issues for staff, and customers. This is problematic for any scenario in which the folder was not 'Active' when the Project Suspension took place. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 'Return to Work' attempt on 50685 Traffic Control Inspection will not save if 'Project Suspension' attempt does not already exist.
- Saving the 'Return to Work' attempt will update the folder status back to what is was when 'Project Suspension' was saved
    - Exception: The folder status should not update to 'Active' if the folder expiration date is in the past. Instead, it should update to 'Expired.
- These features work on the following folder types: DS, EX, RW, ECV
- These features work not just once, but as many times as needed on the same process

**Old Notes**
Description: Per Richard, inspection processes aren't closing out of their AMANDA task list. This is a problem for inspectors who also review plans, as it makes it difficult to find relevant review tasks.

> Name

Ryan Mooney

> What application are you using?

Other / Not Sure

> Describe the problem.

ROW has been directed to gather data related to our CIP case load.  I believe step one to this will be a custom report.

We would need to see all EXs and RWs  that have any entry (alpha or numeric) in the “CIP Project Manager” field. This info field lives on the Info tab and, in case it helps, the code is 76360 and the type is A. This is the immediate need.

Eventually, we would like to further develop our reporting to capture information on franchised utilities as well, to see the permit load for them as opposed to CIP, city departments, and private development.


> Describe the solution you have in mind.

A Crystal Report with the above information broken down by folder status, such as 'Active' 'Pending' 'Internet Pending' 'Expired' and 'Final'. 

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

If we can get a view on CIP projects.

> Users

ROW staff, Jim Dale, Rob Spillar, Richard Mendoza.

> Sponsorship

Jim Dale

> Which Strategic Direction 2023 “Mobility” indicators would this new application impact?

System efficiency and congestion,Safety,Condition of transportation-related infrastructure

> Which Austin Strategic Mobility Plan goals would this new application support?

Health & Safety — Protect Austinites by lowering the risk of travel-related injury and promoting public health.,Affordability — Lower the cost of traveling in Austin by providing affordable travel options.,Sustainability — Promote integrated designs and quality additions to the built environment while reducing impacts and promoting efficient use of public resources.,Economic Prosperity — Promote economic growth for individuals and the city through strategic investments in transportation networks that meet the needs of the 21st century.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

None considered.

> Is there anything else we should know?

Rob has asked us to get back to him by the middle of next week.

> How have other divisions/departments/cities addressed similar challenges? 

This would be unique to ROW I believe.

> What application are you using?

Other / Not Sure
AMANDA v6 Portal: Austin Build + Connect (see attachment)

> Describe the problem.

I'd like to add some language to the Apply for Right of Way Permits / Special Events initial/splash page.

Include the following as a second paragraph:
""Right of Way Management only issues permits for City of Austin Full Purpose Jurisdiction (COA FPJ).  Before submitting your request, check here to determine the jurisdiction.  Application fees are not refundable for requests that fall outside of the COA FPJ.""

The customer would be linked to the City's jurisdiction map - https://www.austintexas.gov/gis/JurisdictionsWebMap/ 



> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

This will help our ROW customers from needlessly applying for (and paying for) a permit which we don't review.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

Currently we refund customers who errantly submit applications outside of the FTJ.  This is counter ordinance which states that application fees are non-refundable.  We've considered not issuing refunds to these customers, since our main permit webpage already addresses this, but this hasn't gone over well with customers.

> Is there anything else we should know?

No specific date but as we push more customers online the need becomes more pressing.  Hopefully this is a quick/easy fix though!

### Overview:
- Dec 2018: SCP Phase 2 went live
    **- Included in this release was an update to SCP fees, instructing the system to calculate the % of fee breakdown to each FDU**
- March 2019: DSD reported a bug with their FDU report caused by the update to SCP fees 
- Spring 2019: Controller's Office reported a massive backlog of AMANDA fees collected that were unable to be deposited due to the SCP fee bug(s). 
    **- Basically the way the SCP fees were configured makes it impossible for the related FDU code to populate on any of the reports that finance staff & other finance systems depend on.** 
- 6/13/19: All SCP stakeholder departments met @ Barton Oaks to discuss this issue & solutions
    - An interim solution was implemented; DSD agreed to manually populate FDU codes for the controller's office. This will allow the money to be deposited while the fee fixes were being developed. 
- Summer 2019: CTM engaged Unisys to perform the development needed 
- 8/5/19 - George w/ CTM promoted Unisys' dev to TEST
- Late Aug 2019 - DSD & ATD provided UAT feedback
- 11/8/19 - Tracy L, Deanna D, & Mark C synced on the project & identified next steps
    - CTM committed to performing the necessary development to get this to PROD

Description: User Story From Richard: ""The issue with the Amanda system when logging my deficiencies is if I have multiple missing items checked ( Missing barricade, missing sign, missing TCP) when adding my comments all task are listed as missing for each one. This makes it hard to determine if I am logging the correct deficiencies under the correct code/tab."" 

Deficiency Text needs to be more specific as it currently only says one word in some cases like ""Missing"". This causes confusion when adding other items to the deficiency as the Category and Subcategory of ""Missing"" is not explicitly shown. 

**Customer:** Nathan C.
**Ready For Development?** No

Can select multiple deficiencies from nested items but when they go to add notes they can't see what notes go with what deficiency because at that point the name of the specific option isn't visible. 

Goal after AMANDA 7 upgrade is to use Inspector App.

### As an SCP case manager reviewing the Transport Facility subtype, I need to know how many total network nodes the Transport Fiber is feeding, as a folder info. 

### As an SCP Transport Facility applicant, I need to pay the correct application and approval fee amounts, based on total network nodes. 

**Stakeholder:** April Sellars
**DTS Manager:** Tracy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- These updates only apply to the Transport Facility subtype of the SCP folder
- The portal application no longer asks the customer to provide any data for the Network Nodes/Attachments free form tab (see image below, the section that is crossed out). 
- A new folder info is created, Info Description: # of Network Nodes Fed by Transport Facility
- The new info populates on the portal application for the customer to fill out. It is a mandatory field, and the portal description is 'How man network nodes is the Transport Fiber feeding?' 
- When the portal applicant clicks 'Submit' the correct application fee is inserted & billed
- The application fee logic is as follows:
    - Fee calculates based on the value of the new info '# of Network Nodes Fed by Transport Facility'.  A $500 flat fee is charged for nodes 1-5. For each pole over 5, $250 is charged.
    -  If value is 1-5, the fee is $500 
    - If value is greater than 5, $500 + $250 for each value over 5 is charged
    - Example 1: Value = 6, Application Fee = $750
    - Example 2: Value = 4, Application Fee = $500
    - Example 3: Value = 8, Application Fee = $1,250
- When the system bills the SCP Approval Fees, the logic is updated as follows: 
    - A prorated ROW usage fee is calculated for the remaining months in the year. Fee logic is $20.83 * Total # of Nodes/Poles * # of full months left in the calendar year. The Total # of Nodes/Poles value is retrieved from the new folder info. 
    - An annual ROW usage fee is calculated. Fee logic is $250 * Total # of Nodes/Poles * Years Paid For. The Total # of Nodes/Poles value is retrieved from the new folder info. Years Paid For is retrieved from folder info 76116
    - The prorated fee and the annual fee are added together, and inserted as a total amount.

**People record type ‘City Owner’ Info:**
-	ATD uses this people type as a solution/workaround for entities that are performing ROW work, but do not require a ROW license because they’re COA or a franchise. 
-	Currently there are 433 ‘City Department’ people records. Only a small fraction of those represent entities that do not require a ROW license.
-	This causes the ROW portal applications to display hundreds of inaccurate ‘valid contractors’ for applicants to select from
-	This may also lead to ROW issuing a permit without a valid contractor listed. 
-	Our goal is to only populate valid contractor records for the portal applicants
**Questions for AOB:**
-	Is anyone using ‘City Department’ for a specific business need?
-	If we cleaned up ‘City Department’ records to only those that ROW needs, would that have negative impacts?
-	If cleaning up the ‘City Department’ records is not an ideal solution, we’ll need to create a new people type. Any objections?

    - All active LC folders
    - All people records type: City Department
- DS & EX folders are coded so that the people tab requires a valid ROW Contractor people record. The folder will not issue without one. We must keep this in mind as we develop a solution for this issue.

- Takes user back to Assign Permits
- Updates the folder status to 'Application Pending'
    - This essentially makes it impossible for any customer to pick this application up and finish it

**On the attachments page, pressing the 'Cancel this application' button does the following:**
- Takes user back to Assign Permits
- Updates the folder status to 'Aborted'
    - This essentially makes it impossible for any customer to pick this application up and finish it
    - Also, this folder will end up being deleted by the system if this isn't caught in time by staff/customers

### Questions for Unisys re: Solutions:
- Info Page: Remove 'Search Again' as an option
- Attachments page: Remove 'Cancel this Application' as an option
- See #2950 - add the button that makes saving & continue later an option
- Give the customer the ability to abort everything they've done, and update the folder so that another customer (or the same one) can come back at another time to self-assign.

### As they system, I need to set the RW-Film permit expiration date to the last date of permit approval.

**DTS Manager:**
Tracy Linder

**Stakeholders:**
Kim, Paloma, Evelyn Powers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Upon folder issuance, the RW-Film folder inserts a value in the folder expiration date that follows this logic:
    - (Value in folder info 75605 'Start Date') + (value in folder info 75640 Total Number of Days) -1 = Expiration Date
    - Day 1 of permit approval is the start date, that's why we subtract 1 from Start Date + Total # of Days
    - Example: (Test Folder RSN 12317823) Start Date info is 9/16/19. Total # of Days info is 3. So the folder expiration date should be 9/18/19.
- The RW-Film folder status updates to expired at 3:00 am the day after folder expiration
    - Following the above example, the folder should expire at 3:00 am on 9/19/19

Description: The film permit expiration calculation is odd and not always consistent. Evelyn should be able to explain more.

Hi Team,

The testing instructions I promised you are below. Hopefully everyone can still meet the testing deadline of this Friday. Please text or call my cell if you need any help. 

Thanks Everyone!
Tracy


**Testing Instructions** 
 
1.	Log into AMANDA TEST & Portal Test
a.	Reset password here if needed 
2.	In AMANDA Test, locate an SP folder to test on
a.	Folder Status shouldn't matter, but In Review is easier to work with
b.	Make sure the folder doesn't already have child UC/LM folders
3.	On the People Tab of the SP, make yourself the applicant
a.	Replace the current applicant with your test people record. Ask for help with this if needed. 
4.	On the Info Tab of the SP, update the UC or LM review info to 'YES' & press Save
a.	 
5.	Verify that a child folder was created 
a.	If no child folder was created, testing cannot continue; contact Tracy
6.	Verify the status of the new folder is 'Pending Customer Action'
7.	Verify that you received an email (as the applicant of the SP folder)
a.	Does the email say what you want it to say? Do  you have email feedback? 
b.	If you didn’t receive an email, check to see if you followed step #3
8.	Open the child UC or LM folder; you will need the permit number & folder ROW ID to continue
9.	In Test Portal, click 'Assign Permit'
10.	Follow the on-screen directions to enter the permit & pin #
a.	The pin # is the Folder ROW ID
11.	Submit a test application
12.	In AMANDA, open or refresh the folder that you just submitted an application for
a.	Status should be Internet Pending 
b.	Everything else about the folder should match what you expect an internet pending folder to look and behave like

As AMANDA testing potentially ramps up, it will be necessary to ensure that testers have the proper level of permissions.  Beyond this, there is a function (perhaps two) that cashiers currently do not have access to and we would like to remedy that.

**Note:** We discovered that both these issues are part of the same user story.
    - #211 will be closed 

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim, Mooney

**User Story:** As the ATD Cashier at Toomey, I need to record all fees i accept in one system of record. The few remaining fees not in AMANDA should be added ASAP. 

**User Story:** As the person paying an 'out of process' fee, I need to be able to pay those fees online.

**Future State:**
_When ROW staff need to collect an 'out of process' fee_
1. In AMANDA, create a new GF folder, choose subtype ATD
2. Add the project location (site address) to the folder property tab
3. Add people record types Applicant, and Billed-To to the people tab
4. **Need SME Input** Complete required info fields on the info tab
    - Kim was unsure if TCP Review staff will want any info tab fields. Perhaps the TCP #? 
5. Insert & bill the fee(s), provide customer with the invoice
    - The folder status will be 'Pending Payment'
6. The customer pays the fee
7. The folder status updates to 'Payment Complete' -End Process-

- Brandi is best to ask for a list of fees collected outside of AMANDA
- The General Fees (GF) folder in AMANDA is what other departments are using to record fees outside of a specific case folder
- TCP Review Fee is being collected manually
    - **Need SME Input**
    - Amount? Flat Fee - no logic
    - Name of Fee?
    - ATD Surcharge?
---------

Old Description: ROW Fee audit recommendation that out of process TCP review fees be captured in AMANDA ASAP. 
Two Options TBD:
1. Create new fee and apply it on existing folder types
2. Create new (very simple) folder and fee

-----

**Meeting Date/Time:**  June 4, 2020 @ 130-2pm
**Attendees:** Nate, Tracy, Sree, Paloma, Kim

- A demo from Sree on 6/3 showed us that if there any unpaid ATD fees for the people ID used, AMANDA would throw a Warning upon issuance of Folder. Once the message is ""OK'd"", the permit is issued and goes Active.
    - The Issue we found with this is that the permit should not be issued or go Active if there are unpaid fees once the Warning is accepted.
    - This also raised the concern of the giving the Reviewer the option to issue the permit if it is a special situation or case.
- The verbiage on the error was changed to say total amount of fee owed and people id. Does not say what folder or fee (Reviewer will have to Research).

### Solutions Identified for Stakeholder Consideration:
- Change process to a folder Process attempt (This is a good one but will it hinder workflow or add value?)
- Set monetary limit for hard stop (permit not issued) and any fees less have warning (Permit is issued)
- Hard stop (Permit not issued)
- Warning only (Permit is issued)

**Challenges:** 
- Reviewer needs the option to issue or not issue the permit if there are any unpaid ATD fees
- Current Permit issuance process does not check to see if the process has already been done for that particular permit/PeopleID in order to NOT issue the permit and allow the Reviewer to see what unpaid fees there are. 
- Cannot make changes to Main Folder Page error (allows for more options in the warning) due to it being a web page code configuration change that would involve CTM.

**Next Steps:**

- [x] Create Meeting w/Kim and Paloma

- [ ] Get feed back on which option they would prefer going with

- [ ] Get LIT Estimate of work/complexity from changes (possible time frame)

I wanted to elevate this issue to you as we’ve been experiencing PNTS Geoloader errors ongoing for the past number of weeks, which has made it difficult to plan often time-sensitive communications work around. I and others have submitted tickets to CTM and emailed Prentice Mooney (e.g., tickets for Parkfield, Cherrywood, 46th-47th and I know of Webberville, one of the Shoal Creek construction notices, Healthy Streets). 
 
Prentice seems to think that it may be maintenance to the AMANDA system, scheduled or unscheduled, that prevents AMANDA from creating corresponding folders for the PNTS using the GeoLoader. Sometimes it resolves itself in a day or two, but you have to check back repeatedly. The workaround for smaller address pulls is to do it manually using Google maps, but this doesn’t work for larger projects. 
 
Would it be possible to reach out to whoever manages the AMANDA system and see if there’s another solution than just hoping it’ll work when you need it to? It might be helpful to better understand the system’s maintenance schedule, or if there’s a solution to keep the GeoLoader from breaking so often that someone is working on. 
 
Thanks for your help with this,
 
Dylan J.

------

### Resolution:

No helpful resolution can be identified at this time. Prentice with CTM-GIS thinks this issue is caused by attempting to run PNTS while AMANDA is down for maintenance, but I'm not convinced that is the true cause. She's added all PNTS users to the AMANDA user distribution list, so they can plan around scheduled maintenance. **I've asked users to send me an email each time they encounter this error,** so I can compile a log that will allow us to find the related system error logs and hopefully get to the bottom of the error. We can also use it to compare to AMANDA system maintenance and determine if that is truly the issue.

## Unpaid Fee Flag
_AKA # 46 Unpaid Fee Flag on Permit Issuance (Audit Request)_

**Stakeholders:** Paloma, Kim, Mooney

**User Story:** As a ROW permit analyst (PLA), I need to know if any of the folder people have unpaid ROW fees BEFORE the permit is issued, so I can place the permit on hold and attempt to collect the outstanding fee(s).

**Current State:**
1. The PLA, prior to permit approval, performs manual research to identify any unpaid ROW fees for ALL people listed on the people tab (Contractor, applicant, contact, whoever). 
    - They do not collect fees billed before 10/1/2013.
2. If no outstanding fees are identified, the permit is issued. End process. 
3. If outstanding ATD fees are identified, the PLA provides the outstanding fee information to the person/entity responsible for payment. 
    - So if there are 3 unique people/entities on the permit, each entity will be provided with their unique fee information. 
    - The people/entities are provided with instructions for paying, all outstanding bill numbers, and the total for each bill number. 
4. The PLA adds a note to the folder description: ""Pending Outstanding Fee Payment **TL""
5. The customer will pay the fees, either online or in person. 
6. The customer notifies PLA of payment
    - When this step is missed, it leads to customers working in the ROW without an approved permit
7. PLA issues the permit. End Process. 

**Future State:**
1. Folder issuance is attempted, either by a user from the folder tab, or by a system procedure like post payment.
    - We need to be sure any new procedure doesn't cause payment update failures when the fees are paid online. (Put simply, lets learn from the issues caused by the Post Payment upgrade.)
    - This feature may have to be split into 2 features, one for running this procedure when issuance is initiated by the user from the folder tab, and another for running this procedure when issuance is initiated by a post payment procedure. **Will need LIT feedback on this.**
2. The system performs the unpaid fee verification
    - See # 1 in Current State; the system needs to do this instead of the PLA
    - Query all unpaid fees for each people record on the people tab. Of those fees, exclude any not in folder types RW, EX, LC, ECV, GF, or DS. Of those fees, exclude any created prior to 10/1/2013. **Now you have a list of qualifying fees.** 
3. If **qualifying fees** are found, an alert window opens informing the PLA that unpaid fees were found. 
    - The window will display this text: A people record related to this permit has unpaid ROW fees!
        - **Stakeholder input needed.** Please provide feedback on the proposed content of the alert window:    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49930868/74903386-60935e00-536e-11ea-9440-7aa50dc414c4.png)
    - The window will facilitate the following actions:
        - Allow the user to click a button to continue with permit issuance
        - Allow the user to click a button to abort the permit issuance, and view information related to the qualifying fees
        - The people invoice list view is an example of how we might provide the user with data about the qualifying fees:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49930868/74903558-e0212d00-536e-11ea-968f-a603023fc067.png)
4. PLA will provide the unpaid fee information (see list view above) to the customer, and note 'Pending Outstanding Fee Payment**' in the folder description.
    - If it's possible to email the 'list view' of unpaid fees to the customer from the window in AMANDA, that would be ideal **Will need LIT feedback on this.**
5. Customer pays
    - Jump to # 8 if customer does not pay
6. AMANDA notifies the PLA (or perhaps a resource task list?) that the permit needs to be issued **Stakeholder input needed. How would they most like to be notified?**
7. PLA issues the permit. End Process.
8. **Stakeholder input needed.** Will ROW need/want to know that these fees are still unpaid after a certain amount of time? For example, a monthly report emailed by the system with info about all 'fee flag alerts' that occurred in the previous month; only include info for fees that are still unpaid.
    - This would be another story/feature however LIT needs to be aware of the reporting requirement when developing the fee flag feature. 
------


Old Description: Requesting an alert to notify analysts when there are unpaid fees affiliated with any people records tied to a folder. Something similar to the current alert received when an analyst attempts to issue a permit that has violations affiliated with an address records tied to a folder.

There isn't anyone on the TDSD team to create/maintain these polygons. Could be handled TDSD intern, AECom, or the DTS GIS team. 

Examples of layers:
- Active TIA cases - these would be the same as site plan polygons; could ask CTM to enhance the existing field by adding a TIA number
- Transportation mitigation -

Add to maps including:
- Property Profiles
- AMANDA web maps
- ATD Development Review ...

### Email From Ryan Ward 9/18/19:

Tracy,

I would like to request a daily report that captures Violation Fees. We’re working on process improvements to add Quality Control (QC), as to how we fee the customer. There have been some fees contested recently and we review each one of those instances. This list would give us the ability to see what fees were assessed each day, so we can review validity. Just another transparency effort on our part.

Let me know if this is something you can generate or if it will have to be a project. Also, what the timeframe would be for completion.

On another note, could you run a report that shows each inspector, with relation to the fees they have assessed, broken down monthly for this FY?

Thanks,
Ryan

## Report #1 - Daily Fee Report
**Purpose:** Allow the supervisor to perform an accountability review on all inspection fees billed on any given day.

**Primary User:** Inspection Supervisor (Mani)

**User Search Parameters:**
* Start Date 
* End Date

**Query Parameters:**
* TCI Inspection Fees
* Start Date
* End Date

**Report Data (Include for each Item that meets parameters):**

* Fee info (name, amount, date billed, payment status, bill #, invoiced by user ID)
* Folder #
* Contractor info

**Misc:**
* Group the report data by the permit #
* A daily batch report would be nice, not necessary

My UC Folder in AMANDA needs to have my name added back to the ROW Reviewer Lookup Table. I was removed as a reviewer without my permission. the ROW Review Discipline 61130.  Sarah Doersman and Reza Sedhgy need to be removed. They do not work for ROW MGMT anymore.

**Although we should consider the ramp up time that new resources take, it is alarming that no issues have been completed. Luckily however, we've identified this issue early enough to implement proactive solutions.** 

**Probable Cause:** AMANDA DTS issues are getting stuck at Review/QA and Ready to Deploy.
- 4 Issues in Review/QA
- 2 Issues in Ready to Deploy

**Other Indications that UAT is the Block:**
- Stakeholders expressing wanting very much to provide feedback, but just not having time to finish
- Poor results when attempting to elicit feedback by email
- Better, good results when attempting to elicit feedback by scheduling Teams meetings

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Schedule a reoccurring weekly meeting with this group of stakeholders to gather feedback and to facilitate testing. 
- Educate stakeholders on our approach to development, especially our sprint cadences, and what to expect
- After each sprint planning session, email stakeholders with the sprint goals, and together measure if the stakeholders have the resources for each item in the sprint. 
- Create a standard process for DTS AMANDA to follow when an issue is pending customer feedback
    - Add **Status: Pending stakeholder response** to the top of the issue description (Tracy not a big fan; too much overhead)
- Ask ROW to designate a SPOC from their group of power users (PU).
    - It's difficult for us to know which PU should be contacted for any given issue, resulting in having to include all of them on emails, which in turn creates some unnecessary email clutter. 
    - The thought is we can email the SPOC, who can forward it to the correct power user. 
- Tracy and Nate to learn more about what each PU does, and how they contribute as a PU. 
- To help improve the efficiency of email communications, Tracy will introduce email standards to the stakeholder team.
    - Subject Line should begin with the DTS ticket number & name (or shortened name, be flexible)
    - Tracy or Nate will add a link to the github issue when sending the first email in a thread, or responding for the first time in a thread
    - Only discuss 1 DTS ticket per email (unless it makes more sense to discuss multiple, related tickets. Be flexible!) 
- Use a new label like 'Awaiting Response' to better identify issues that may be delayed due to this issue, and will need more followup than we may have considered. 
    - Per team feedback, we'll try using the Blocked pipeline to meet this need, and circle back if it doesn't help. 
    - If we do end up using a label, be sure to use a Status: type. 
- Schedule bi-weekly check-ins on this issue to determine if these solutions work. We'll know we've solved this issue when we start seeing issues consistently update to Closed.

In the Utility Coordination (UC )Folder in AMANDA, Austin Water has requested a new SOP for Austin Water utility (AW) Reviews within the UC folder to meet a critical business need for them, ATD, CPO, and for applicants such as PWD, Watershed, and other Depts. 
The new AW SOP requires that;
1. AW Infrastructure Management Reviewer 51374 reviews first 2 submittals
2.  If Rejected by a reviewer within the AW- Infrastructure Group, that reviewer will also reject the AW Pipeline Engineering Review  51364.
3. Once AW Pipeline Reviewer Approves that folder, that reviewer will Approve both disciplines. 
Request:  Please allow permission within the UC Folder to allow for any of the AW Infrastructure Management Reviewers lookup table to attempt the process within the
AW Pipeline Engineering process 51363 and vice versa. 
On the UC Folder, both sets of reviewers should be able to complete processes for the other. 
Please note that we will be utilizing the ""AW-Pipeline Engineering"" Group Account within the reviewer lookup table 51374 until an individual within that group is assigned. 

> How soon do you need this?

Soon — This week 

> Is there anything else we should know?

The Corridor Program Office has critical work that required this new AW process to be in place to complete our reviews in a timely manner. ATD-CPO has 2016 Mobility Bond plans and waivers in the AW Review queue that are being held until we can get these requests into the AMANDA UC Folder. The new AW process will delay these critical safety projects if we cannot get these permissions up and running quickly. 
As the owner of the UC folder, creator of the UC processes, and the AULCC Chairman, no other permissions should be required to complete this request FOR THIS FOLDER ONLY! I am working directly with AW for this request. If this changes anything within the enterprise-wide folder processes, please let me know ASAP. 
Thanks for the help!!

**Stakeholder:** Kimberly P. w/ ROW, copy Paloma
**Service Now:** CALL0036082

The EX folder portal application is programmed, when pressing the submit button, to create a folder for each street added to the application. After the customer presses submit, all folders created as part of this workflow should immediately update folder status to 'Pending Payment'. **This is currently not happening anymore.** Instead, only the parent folder updates to 'Pending Payment', and all child folders update to 'Application Incomplete'. 

The system is currently allowing the customer to pay fees on the child folders that are 'Application Incomplete', and when that happens, the folder status does not update, and as such, never lands in queue for staff review. **This is a major issue.** 

Finally, the system is also allowing the customer to continue applying for the child folders with 'Application Incomplete' status, and upon submittal, inserts & bills the same fees that have already been inserted & billed, thereby double charging the applicant and causing staff to have to perform refunds. **Also a major issue.**

**Solution:** Update the code so the child folders of this process update to 'Pending Payment' after submitting.

> Describe the problem.

The AMANDA UC Folder attachments are not visible to the AMANDA Applicant / Internet user through the AB+C Portal/ROWMAN portal. All attachments on that folder should be visible to all people on the People Tab. However, the first step, and most critical step, is to allow the Applicant to see the attachments, including attachments uploaded by the reviewers on the folder such as Austin Water. This is a critical function of the folder and the newly instituted Blue Beam review (Electronic Plan review)  

> Is there anything else we should know?

WIth the Work From Home orders, this is a critical function missing from the UC Folder.
Applicants are not able to complete coordination without this function and ability to see comments made from City Reviewers. This could affect public safety and utility systems.

Hi Tracy,

Promote 3.0.5 and 3.0.6 were promoted to PROD but the EX – work dates in the past and the Issued By issues were fixed following the promote. Could you please Test the following functionality in TEST:

1)	Issued By Field
As the system, when the ""Activate Upon Payment"" info field is set to yes and there is a payment made issuing the folder, the Issued by field should be:
•	DS (residential) - user who created the application fee invoice
•	All others - User who Accepted (AR) web acceptance process

2)	EX - Remove Work Date in the Past Check
Remove the check on EX folders that looks at the Work Dates in Past when being issued.

Once you confirm these are working in TEST, we can promote to PROD.

Thanks,
David G

AMANDA appears to be up to her old tricks.  

Austin Commercial submitted a permit for the 400-1123 block (one segment in AMANDA/AB+C Portal) of S Congress.  For some reason, when AMANDA received this it split the request into two separate permits.  One of the permits - #12395186 – came through without any segments listed on the Property tab.  The other of the permits - #12395196 – came through with the appropriate segment on the Property tab.  

Additionally, the requestor had to pay an application fee (+surcharge) for each of those permits.  They are not interested in the refund. 

Any thoughts on what may have triggered this? 

Thanks!

Hey Tracy,

We just realized that several EX subtypes are not able to add attachments after they’ve submitted their AB+C Portal application.

Here’s the list of the EX subtypes that are NOT working:
Austin Energy Chilled Water, Austin Energy Electric, Austin Transportation, Watershed Protection Storm Drain

We previously thought this was only an issue with ATD subtypes but it turns out AE is impacted as well and they’re a high-volume customer.  We tried to figure out when this might have broken but it’s hard to say.  The incident email that’s attached could have been the trigger or perhaps it’s been broken since we first identified the ATD issue (see the AB+C Portal attachment).

Let me know if I should submit this as an AMANDA help ticket!
