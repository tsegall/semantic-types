Parking Meters would like to have a Non-311 SR request tracking tool available to them. They would also like to utilized the ""My Assignments"" tab to allow technicians to take photos of the SR being completed. Have already talked to Stephanie and Diana about this request.

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

We would like to see parking enforcement work orders for bike rack damage, graffiti on pay stations, scratched screens etc. show up on our knack page.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

Currently emails are sent and we need a better way.

> Name

Joseph A.

> What application are you using?

Other / Not Sure

> Describe the problem.

Outdated and manual process for parking occupancy data collection. This causes extreme administrative waste, taking 3x the amount of time to complete a parking survey. Manual processes also present more opportunity for transpose errors. Data is being collected in the field and then transposed onto an excel spread sheet. 

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

The ability to have a custom back office to create data entry for parking surveys that a data collection team can enter into a digital tablet which is automatically linked to an analysis form that can generate automatic reports including spatial analysis and map view.

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

When we reduce the time it takes to complete a parking survey, which currently takes:
4 days to create map for surveys for data collection
6 days for actual data collection
7 days+ to input data into excel sheets for analysis
Total = 2 weeks 3-days, if not more since we have only one person that makes the maps and inputs data.

> Users

Parking Enterprise division staff, Ryan Royal, David Bracken and parking staff conducting data collection.

> Sponsorship

Jason R.and Jacob C.

> Which Strategic Direction 2023 “Mobility” indicators would this new application impact?

System efficiency and congestion,Condition of transportation-related infrastructure

> Which Austin Strategic Mobility Plan goals would this new application support?

Affordability — Lower the cost of traveling in Austin by providing affordable travel options.,Sustainability — Promote integrated designs and quality additions to the built environment while reducing impacts and promoting efficient use of public resources.,Economic Prosperity — Promote economic growth for individuals and the city through strategic investments in transportation networks that meet the needs of the 21st century.,Innovation — Draw inspiration from forward-looking cities around the world, change the way we think about what’s possible, and set an example for the rest of the country.

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

An efficient process that will help ATD staff make better curb management decision in a more reasonable time frame with more accurate results. This coordinated process will give more accurate results both visual/spatial but technical. It will help standardize parking studies taken by ATD .

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

> Is there anything else we should know?

As soon as data and technology has time to help with this project, but respectfully, as soon as possible.

~KITS integration is down.~ We learned that it was the KITS system itself that was down. It was a planned outage KH needed to perform an update. 

## Note
This is my first exposure to these scripts. While I'm comfortable with dealing with what they do at a technical level (mysql connections, etc), I am unfamiliar with the task they are meant to execute and who the stakeholders are. Any information and guidance about the degree of urgency this issue has or who I may need to speak to about that remote server is very welcome!

## Details
@chiaberry brought it to my attention that an airflow DAG was failing. The ETL in question [is this one](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-kits/blob/production/atd-kits/signal_status_publisher.py) in the `atd-kits` repo. The failure is [found here](https://austininnovation.slack.com/archives/C013G4RNJ01/p1650994984300209?thread_ts=1650994923.293779&cid=C013G4RNJ01), and indicates an issue with the connection to the mysql server running on `10.66.20.157` which provides a mysql database named `KITSDB`. I have spun up a docker container with a mysql client, and I am unable to connect to the server with the following command: `mysql -u ATD_FME_SERVICE -p***** -h 10.66.20.157 -D KITSDB`.

@dianamartin kindly referred us to some folks: ""Brian C. if it’s server related. But maybe Lance and Allyson know about it (MMC)."", and I have reached out to Brian on teams. I stated:

>[1:08 PM] Hereford, Frank
Brian, how are you doing - I hope well. My name is Frank Hereford and I'm part of the DTS team under Amenity A. (previously John C..)
> One of our integration scripts which connects to a mysql database on 10.66.20.157 to use the KITS_DATABASE there has started to fail with an error. Initially, it through an exception and suggested looking at the server lots, but now I am unable to make a connection to the server at all with a mysql client. 
> Is this something you can help me with, or point me in the right direction?

@chiaberry has disabled the DAG for now, and I will update this issue with more information as I find it.

### Secondary Software Solutions (⏳ permitting)

Crickets... 🦗🦗

### Rejected Software Solutions 🙅‍♀️

**[UIPATH](https://www.uipath.com/)** 
Not testing because they only have a downloadable Windows app
The Task Capture feature/app looked interesting

**[FLEEQ](https://www.fleeq.io/)** 
Not testing this because they offer ""bitesize videos"" and lack the automation I'm looking for here; this is basically serial Snagit with annotation (take a screenshot, highlight/mark up/annotate, and create a GIF or video of the steps)

**[CLOUDAPP](https://www.getcloudapp.com/)**
Not testing because this looks mainly focused on video and GIF capture, with manually added annotations and feedback options (only?); the product is also download only and I suspect they don't offer a Mac version; the demo is behind a sign-up so I can't get a good sense of the product without giving them my info

**[LOOM](https://www.loom.com/)**
Not testing because while this was suggested as a Scribe alternative, it seems focused on video messaging only

**[BLUEPRINT](https://www.blueprintsys.com/)** 
Not testing because this seems more focused on analysis than documentation, does not offer a free trial, and would require a request for a demo

>Additional reading of the [change-logs](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases) going back to the 2.0 release would also be prudent, in particular focusing on any behavior or breaking changes Hasura points out. Luckily, there are few. I’ve brushed through these and don’t see any glaring issues, but I’d want to spend an hour or so carefully inspecting them.
>
>I’d love to discuss any of those behavior changes that anyone thinks could be impactful. It’s my belief that if we were to 1) all :thumbsup: on that list of changes as being safe or understood, and 2) have the app be tested with the testing script that Product maintains, then we could plan for an upgrade in testing, staging and then production.

>This was just a fun exercise initially, but I think it has strong potential to be straightforward. I would be happy to spin this conversation into an issue also at anytime.

Restock Adjustment.
I need to make an adjustment to a restock that was made in error.

Should have been 12” tunnel Louvers (intended restock of 50)
I have modified the name so that they do not appear so similar to limit/prevent future occurrences.
Also, I have 2 transactions that will need to be returned as they have been issued at a wrong price,
I will take care of the returns once the unit price is corrected and reissue them at the correct dollar amount.

> How soon do you need this?

I will be needing this correction to be made as soon as possible due to the wrong dollar value being associated with the tunnel visors. Returns will be necessary to fix the variance.
There are currently 2 transactions with incorrect dollar values.

> Name

Nelson E.

> What application are you using?

Other / Not Sure

> Describe the problem.

It will be useful as a reference point for city employees who wants to leverage available fiscal for their project instead of reaching out to me for any question they might have. 

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

We a considering creating a SharePoint or GIS database (whichever works best) of TIA fiscal and Fee in -lieu database for internal consumption. When completed, it will be share to all city stakeholders to alert them of available funds that can be leveraged for their transportation related projects.

I had a quick meeting with Diana Martin who advised I submit this SR

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

By the share use of the URL

> Users

CPO, ATD, PW, DSD etc

> Sponsorship

Eric Bollich 

> Which Strategic Direction 2023 “Mobility” indicators would this new application impact?

['Safety', 'Condition of transportation-related infrastructure']

> Which Austin Strategic Mobility Plan goals would this new application support?

['Health & Safety — Protect Austinites by lowering the risk of travel-related injury and promoting public health.', 'Sustainability — Promote integrated designs and quality additions to the built environment while reducing impacts and promoting efficient use of public resources.', 'Placemaking — Build a transportation network that encourages social interaction through quality urban design, and connects users to the many places that make Austin unique.', 'Economic Prosperity — Promote economic growth for individuals and the city through strategic investments in transportation networks that meet the needs of the 21st century.', 'Innovation — Draw inspiration from forward-looking cities around the world, change the way we think about what’s possible, and set an example for the rest of the country.']

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

We are currently using excel spreadsheet which is not idea for such large scale data

> Is there anything else we should know?

September 2021

> How have other divisions/departments/cities addressed similar challenges? 

TDS have something similar but theirs is strictly Fee in-lieu from 2018- 2021. Mine is older fiscal and fee in lieu from 1984-2021

- Move ""Trip Data"" to a new tab with a new URL
- Add transactional data to the Fees/Payment page.


Currently, Providers pay a lump sum every six months for all the permits they're renewing. That amount is captured in under the ""Monthly Trip Fee Payment Tracking"" section of the page.

As an addition or replacement, Staff would like to have a table that tracks ongoing transactions/payments by Provider, which includes the number of total permits being renewed, and monthly payment for per/trip fees on the Fees/Permits page.

@dianamartin referenced an achieved license page that we might be able to use to show past transactions.

# C Cure 9000

- Brian Craig and Billy only have access
- Diana was taught by Billy

- Need 2 screens, never close (not sure how to get them back up)
- Enter last name to query user
- Click Enter
- Brings up names in table results
- We don’t delete names, but credentials
- Double click on name

First 3 tabs used

`General` tab

- First name
- Last name
- Personnel type: AMD, ATD
(Click the Three dots advanced sort feature, can export the file)

`Credentials` tab
- Card Number
- Badge number

`Clearances` tab
- See Clearance Groups below
- Ex. ALL ACCESS 24/7

## Removing User/Access

- Remove card number under Credentials tab
- Remove clearances under Clearances tab
- Right click on User's Name, Click Delete employee

## 1st way to add new access (If Badge ID is email to Billy)
- Click Add Employee
- Click New
- Enter First name and Last name
- Personnel
- Add Card access number
- Click Enter

*If shows up in cell it takes the info, sometimes it doesn’t

- Add Clearances
- Click Save and close
- Email David that it’s done

## 2nd way to add a new access (if physical badge is available, Badge ID is unknown)

- Scan card to see who the badged user is
- Able to know the card number from the queue (shows up at the bottom of the list)
- Follow steps in 1st way to add new user (Add Name, Personnel, Clearances)
- Click Save and Close
- Go to front door at 8900, Close and try to open the front door
- Then done!

## Clearance Groups

**AMD:**
8700, gates, all doors except server rooms
8900, gates, all doors except server rooms

**ATD:** (Mirror of AMD)
8700, gates, all doors except server rooms
8900, gates, all doors except server rooms

**Gates only:** trash trucks, mowing people (Never handed our cards or fobs)

**S&M** change to **SMB** later: 8900 front north, 2 back doors, and 8900 gate (Thinks to be a DUP of ATD/AMD)

**Testing:** no idea

**TMC:** only the front north door 8700, only during business hours, 7 days a week

**Visitors:** suppose to be only front south door

## Other Notes
- Brian has poked around to modify the system, he might know more things about it
**Reports**: Door access report (PDF report)

*Pro tip: enter random name so I know if it been touched since I was last there.

**Power Outage?** 
- System goes out people can’t get into building
- There are keys to enter the building: Joe Mike, 2 other keys
- Supposed to be David and Billy, but they didn’t get one.

Motorized Conveyances should not include motorcycles, and scooters are being defined as ""Pedestrian"" in some cases when they should be ""Motorized Conveyances."" 

In order to correct this inconsistency, we need to change the unit_desc_id for ""Pedestrian"" to reflect different filtering. 

**Current Filtering**
unit_desc_id = 1 and veh_body_styl_id not in (71, 90) then ""Motor Vehicle"",
unit_desc_id = 1 and veh_body_styl_id in (71, 90) then ""Motorcycle"",
unit_desc_id = 3 then ""Bicyclist"", 
unit_desc_id in (4,5) then ""Pedestrian""

**Change**
unit_desc_id = 4 then ""Pedestrian""
unit_desc_id = 5 then ""Motorized Conveyance""   <= this set already includes scooters as is.

**New**
unit_desc_id = 1 and veh_body_styl_id not in (71, 90) then “Motor Vehicle”,
unit_desc_id = 1 and veh_body_styl_id in (71, 90) then “Motorcycle”,

Data Tracker

> Describe the problem.

For the TCP Tracker in Knack, we'll need to add a couple items for the TCP Reporting Metrics: 
- Monthly intake volume tracker (for all projects) (including volume of projects before TCP migration to the new ROW portal)
- Monthly intake volume tracker (sorted by project)

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

This can be added to the TCP reporting tab in Knack. 

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

You have to manually export the volumes each month or year. 

> Is there anything else we should know?

Preferably soon, by October when we start the new fiscal year.

> What application are you using?

> Describe the problem.

Would like to develop a cost estimate form that can be used to calculate cost estimates for both signs and markings. 

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

We would like the cost estimate page to look very similar to what we have existing on our ""Invoice Details"" pages and would the printed forms to look very similar to the invoice documents we have in Knack already. This would be the central place that Supervisors, office staff, and the sign shop could all use for creating cost estimates for other Divisions/Departments. 

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

We have several excel forms floating around with cost estimate details. The problem with these documents is that it's difficult to keep all of the spreadsheets updated with accurate costs.

### Vision Zero

Vision Zero is the city's strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable mobility for all. Through a combination of safer street design, targeted law enforcement, evidence-based public policy, thoughtful public engagement, and participation from our community, the City of Austin can ensure our streets are safe for everyone.

### Vision Zero Viewer

The City of Austin Transportation Department has been developing a suite of open-source software tools to help our department and community understand where crashes are most likely to occur. Inspired by NYC's open-source Vision Zero Viewer [project](http://www.nycvzv.info/), our goal is to provide users with easy-to-understand visualizations of crashes occurring within Austin city limits.

[Vision Zero Viewer](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data/blob/master/atd-vzv/README.md) is part of our [Vision Zero Crash Data System](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data), which also includes:

 - [Vision Zero Database](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data/blob/master/atd-vzd/README.md) 
 - [Vision Zero Editor](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data/blob/master/atd-vze/README.md)

### Users

The target audience for the Vision Zero Viewer is:
 - Austin residents
 - Transportation safety activists
 - Local and national journalists
 - Industry experts

 Our goal is to provide the audience with tools to better understand the landscape of traffic fatalities and serious injuries in Austin. With the viewer, we hope to answer the following questions:

 - How many traffic fatalities and serious injuries are occurring in Austin? - Where are traffic fatalities and serious injuries occurring in Austin? - When are traffic fatalities and serious injuries most likely to occur?
 - What transportation modes are more likely to be involved in traffic fatalities and serious injuries?
 - Are traffic fatalities and serious injuries affecting a disproportionate number of people of a certain demographic?
 - What is the human impact of traffic fatalities and serious injuries?
 - **Are we making progress in achieving our Vision Zero goals?**

## Design

- Staging site: https://visionzero-staging.austinmobility.io/viewer/
- [XD doc for in-place comments](https://xd.adobe.com/view/316b4a94-f15d-46b0-5e8c-1a7df8ed16b8-475a/grid/)

## Our ask + caveats

So far, our work on Vision Zero Viewer has focused on basic dashboard functionality for core Vision Zero metrics. We've also used it as a tool to identify refinements to the overall Vision Zero Crash Data System scripts and data architecture. 

We are in the process of adding a Design Researcher to our team in the near future and performing user research and usability testing for VZV will be among their first projects. 

Further, we have not:

- Optimized for mobile. 
- Undertaken [accessibility compliance](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data/issues/583). (Though we are thrilled that both a vision-impaired resident and hearing-impaired resident — both of whom serve on the Pedestrian Advisory Council — have volunteered to test with us once our Design researcher is on board.)  

Tl;dr there is still a lot of work to be done so we're not looking to invest heavily in changes right now. That said, we know there is some low-hanging fruit as is and would also love advice/resources for future work. 

## Questions

- Color recommendations would be especially helpful at this point in time:
  - Recommendations on distinct colors for visualizations with 5+ categories, e.g. the *Race and Ethnicity* tab of the *Demographics* chart? 
  - Can you reccomend any existing high-accessiblity and/or legibility color palettes that we should look at adopting?
- Where should we outline our methodology and disclaimers on how we collected and refined crash data?
- Should we make the ""Fatalities/Serious Injuries"" controls  in the summary page global rather than per component?
- How can we improve the text content?

## Background

The City of Austin has a diverse portfolio of mobility infrastructure projects. These are currently tracked in various platforms — from simple spreadsheets administered by a single workgroup to bespoke enterprise software that tracks capital-funded projects. Without a centralized system of record, cross-workgroup coordination is challenging, analysis and reporting capabilities are limited, and resources are not used with maximum efficiency. 

## Scope

This inaugural Moped release will provide a shared platform for Austin Transportation and partners to manage the City of Austin's complete portfolio of mobility infrastructure projects. 

Moped 1.0 will include all the features and infrastructure needed to support an organization-wide transition to a single application to manage their projects. As a result, core project data and we will publish a rich, high-quality dataset to leverage in public-facing viewers, BI platforms, and more.

The following capabilities, outside our current scope of work, will be considered for future Moped releases or constitute independent products in the Moped ecosystem:

- Integrate mobility-related project data from partner organizations like CapMetro, TXDOT, and others who own and manage mobility-related projects in Austin.
- Establishing an [authoritative geography](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lrglPFdwX4qsOB2iIWk3WsFyOljSmOgq-qqOeiwa7MQ/edit) for department-wide use.
- Creating a GIS tool with capabilities beyond the basic feature editing/creation that ArcGIS does now. (Users must currently define features by drawing them freehand, but a future tool would allow users to select individual points, lines, and features from the authoritative geography and tie them to a project.)
- Building a public-facing [mobility project explorer](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/1106). 

## Outcomes and Deliverables

| Desired outcomes                                             | What success looks like                                      | Deliverables                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The City of Austin tracks its complete mobility project portfolio and mobility activities of partner entities on a shared platform. | • Interdepartmental use of the same tool <br /><br />• Ability to tell the full story of mobility activities in Central Texas <br /><br />• Platform tailored to mobility planning, project/program development, and asset tracking | • Enterprise relational georeferenced database • Published live mobility projects lists and maps |
| Systems are integrated so that data flows between them rather than being replicated. | • Data entered once <br /><br />• Automation keeps data sets up to date in multiple systems (e.g. upon project completion or pulling real-time financials) <br /><br />• Consistent information across channels and systems — from public reports to eCapris | • Standardized naming conventions and data type <br /><br />• Integration with eCapris (capital projects), budget, asset inventories, and partner entity project databases |
| Data is available to inform decision-making for mobility planning, project management, and business process improvement. | • Accurate live data is available and well-structured for business intelligence, analysis (mobility, equity, etc.), reporting, and mapping <br /> <br />• Flexible data framework as needs evolve | • User roles, permissions, and structures that support appropriate levels of access and consumption for reliable security, stability, maintenance, QAQC, and data retention. |
| Platform to facilitate effective and efficient project and program management | • Workflows and structures to support coordination across teams for projects <br /><br />• Flexible cost estimation tools in a centralized platform for consistency and quality <br /><br />• Tracking of funding sources not yet in our financial system (developer contribution or by partners) | • Tracking and workflows to support reviews, agreements, work orders, data collection requests, date tracking, update alerts |

The system [consumes and processes](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data/tree/master/atd-etl) vehicle crash data, most prominently from [TxDOT's Crash Records Information System (CRIS)](https://www.txdot.gov/government/enforcement/crash-statistics.html) and Austin Police Department, and loads it into the [Vision Zero Database](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data/blob/master/atd-vzd/README.md). Analysts on the Vision Zero team can then review, correct, and enhance the data via the Vision Zero Editor 

This robust data is then used to identify [high-injury roadways](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=9d133c89a7944d589e55123aba0ee07f), [prioritize](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4a57b61a0dc9444a9d117dc69f3a898e) [safety improvements](https://austintexas.gov/page/programs-and-initiatives), and track the impact of our efforts. It is [available online](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Vision-Zero-Crash-Report-Data/y2wy-tgr5) and also accessible via the [Vision Zero Viewer](https://visionzero.austin.gov/viewer/).

> This is an issue proposing an upgrade to `graphql-engine` `2.11.1` (up from `2.7.1`, I believe) during our next scheduled moped release. The update would apply fixes for a number of bugs they have identified and add a handful of features. None of the changes listed in the release notes (from an albeit quick read) stick out to me as making this urgent, so I would consider this a matter of maintaining best practices.
The patch itself would be ~ 5 lines and the AWS configuration change can be done without downtime while the netlify build takes place during the launch party.

As this is our first nominal, non-major upgrade, I think expanding this to include the creation of a checklist of actions to put in GitBook is appropriate as well. I'm going to bump this to a `1` to include that work. I'm thinking really like a paragraph or two tops and a < 10 item checklist is all we'll need to avoid a knowledge silo around the process.

UC FOLDERS: It seems like Amanda changed attachment types from External Reviewer to Amanda Images. External Review is how our non-city/non-Amanda reviewers are able to view plans. 

I do not know how many cases were involved but it appears to be many folders.  Can this change be reversed immediately?

I'm not sure there are any significant impacts from this, since the ID columns are used for different purposes. But it definitely confused us when debugging the activity log in https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/9642

I do not know what the best solution is to this. After a _quick_ scan of our editor code i do not see the `staff_uuid` anywhere, so the easiest solution may be to issue Amenity a new staff UUID. I defer to @mddilley @frankhereford and @chiaberry.

----


When the activate upon payment function is yes for DS permits, once they make a payment and the permit gets issued. 
AMANDA reflects that the Portal issued the permit. For AMANDA 6, we had worked DS permits that didn't have a web application process (like the ones pending and attached to BPs) that it would reflect the person who created the invoice. 
However since it doesn't work correctly now AMANDA V7.. to better reflect who issued it, I believe using the person who completed the DS Permitting Review process would work better.

@TracyLinder My concern here is for multiple reviewers at one level (two supervisors) and multiple reviewers simultaneously (send to peer and supervisor at the same time). The ask was not clear on if those would be required. 
Our current model assumes a simple path: 
- Original submitter selects Peer Reviewer from dropdown >

Some feature to identify if a Knack or Amanda permit or CSR is for bike or scooter hub maintenance such as a bike rack or scooter micro-mobility hub 

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

A button or selection field when submitting to label the item as a micro mobility bike or scooter related item because hours are wasted having to open every single one to see if the body of a permit or CSR is for that type of submittal.  Meter Shop is not a large group, and they come in at 4AM. So this would save lots of time.

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

There are no work arounds, just opening every single one to identify in the body if it is for bikes, scooter micro mobility type hub permit or maintenance.

> Is there anything else we should know?

Preferably a week because there are no work arounds, just opening every single one to identify in the body if it is for bikes, scooter micro mobility type hub permit or maintenance. This wastes a major amount of time for employees without this feature.

> Describe the problem.

The importance and need of developing a management methodology through Placemaking is essential to have a user-friendly interface to manage processes, collaborate seamlessly with team members, automate tasks, and track key milestones. This becomes important as placemaking sub-programs are expanding and becoming more complex with limited resources. Additionally, there have been some complications with the current application form and intake process currently in place. The intake form currently places all submissions together, rather than separating each intake application. 

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

Looking for more information about The Knack and how it may support and track key milestones for the internal and external agencies. 

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

A user-friendly platform that can be used by internal and external agencies to track key milestones. The ability to track beyond when applications come in, but the need for lengthy community outreach before installation is scheduled.

It appears that there are a few more platforms that support things like mobile devices can upload information on the spot, or an external intuitive platform may make it simpler for outside users.

It would be best to discuss further on Monday, Wednesday, and/or Friday's if availble.

"1356186316","10143","open","Review/QA","Meeting Notes: Building GIS team workflows","DTS","## Editing/QA workflow

Once our team includes technicians, we'll need a system for assigning, performing, and checking edits. The workflow currently in place for VZ Polygon Maintenance provides a good template:

### Github
-  Polygons that need maintenance are assigned individual issues in github by project managers and are placed in backlog
-  Editors move issues to On Deck and In Progress to queue up and work on the edits requested
- Once finished, editors move issues to Review QA, where an analyst can verify the work

### Edit/QA
- Edits happen in Pro on MAINT data
- Data edits are published from MAINT to AGOL
- AGOL data will serve as our authoritative dataset, used across the city, and available for download by the public when applicable
- The AGOL version of each dataset will serve as reference data to check against during the edit/QA process

## Going beyond

While this workflow works well with VZ because the issues are created on a per-polygon basis, it needs to be enhanced to fit the needs of other datasets that have different editing cadences and general structure. For example, Signs data relies on work orders that are filled in Knack.  CTN edits follow a regular cadence, but no work orders or requests take place. We find that github issues provide a useful, simplified structure that allows us to define the scope of an edit (editing a certain polygon, updating certain attributes, etc), and to perform QA checks. However, to bring all the different types of edits we perform into this structure, and to account for all workflows, whether they rely on requests, work orders, or are self-driven, we need a few more elements that may need some testing.

### Issue - feature service connection

Github is a great platform for assigning work. It is simple enough to use, and issues can carry all the information needed in order to perform an edit. However, we currently don't have a consistent way to geographically reference the area, features, or attributes that need to be edited. In the case of Vision Zero Polygons, we receive issues that reference polygon IDs and issues that only name the streets at the intersection requested. In the case of Signs, work orders have a point location. A common editing task in the CTN is bringing in new streets from the CTM street_segment feature, which may or may not be in the same area.

A common geographic identifier to define the scope of the work would compliment to the issue structure of github. We need to create and test a feature service (and web app) that allows the user (project manager, analyst, stakeholder) to draw the extent area, or drop a point in the location that corresponds to a github issue. This feature would include the following fields:

- `GITHUB_ISSUE_ID`
- `GITHUB_PIPELINE`
- `GITHUB_LABEL`

This would allow the editor to pull the feature service on their Pro map and reference data from github. 

At the moment the issue in github is created, the feature is drawn on a web app, and the issue ID is typed in. We'd like to test if this can be used as a relate field, to fill the remaining fields and make them visible on the map. If a relate is not possible, the `GITHUB_ISSUE_ID` field could be used to simply hyperlink to the issue itself. Creating this issue reference geometry would allow us to assign work consistently within github, regardless of data type and issue source. 

### Template with embedded web map app

Creating this reference geometry needs to be as seamlessly integrated into our current github issue creating workflow as possible so that project managers, analysts and stakeholders are not over-burdened by this step. We'd like to test embedding a web map app into an issue template for epics:

#### Template Issue title

1. Create a checkbox list of the features that you'd like to edit and submit the issue. Include necessary data, like IDs into each checkbox item
2. Turn the checkbox tasks into issues 
3. Use the embedded web app to draw a feature for each item on the list and fill in the `GITHUB_ISSUE_ID` field

- [ ] #10168
- [ ] edit polygon b

#### Embedded Web App

### Label for followup work near closed issues

While github issues help us define the scope of an edit, invariably there will always be more work that needs to happen. Sometimes we come across data that should be fixed, but since it is not the root cause of the issue we're working on, we leave it alone. It doesn't sit well with anyone to leave work on the table, but it can also leave issues open for longer than they need to. In order to track areas that editors see need work, but aren't related to the root cause of the issue, we'd like to create a `geo: revisit` label that we can apply to closed issues. We can then query for this label, and create new issues for the adjacent data that needs editing. This would be most helpful for datasets that don't have a consistent stream of data dumps (like the CTN) or work orders (like signs)

> Describe the problem.

TKs are currently being tracked in an excel workbook that resides on the shared drive.  the workbook lacks real time information and is difficult to access and requires significant upkeep.  This process makes TK information inaccessible to the majority of staff.  TKs are very specific numbers and PMs and employees who use them on time sheets should have a resource where they can validate the TK number they need to use.  Additionally, time keepers need to be able to look up and validate TKs being used on staff time sheets.  PMs also need to be able to track balances and manage the TKs for their capital projects. 

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

Currently TKs are being tracked through an excel based solution saved on the shared drive (G:).  Finance is seeking a web-based solution where TKs can be tracked by TK number and name, show real-time balances, the responsible PM name, division name, and last use (if possible).  This would need to be able to have updated data from a source such as mstr or AIMs that could show the updated balance if modifications are made as well as use.

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

Success would look like a web-based solution that allowed users to search for and see all TKs used by ATD, the name, number, balance, responsible PM or manager, division name, last use. It would also be beneficial to be able to drill down into charges against a particular TK but not a must as eCAPRIS does provide that information if needed.

We have a weekly email that goes out to PMs to avoid negative balances and use excel to track all TKs

> How have other divisions/departments/cities addressed similar challenges? 

Currently all solutions are based in excel to my knowledge.  We regularly have TKs that cause payroll errors due to balances going negative.  We also have TKs used that have been closed on timesheets causing payroll rejects.

> Name

2022 Bus Stop Analysis and Map

> What application are you using?

Other / Not Sure

> Describe the problem.

ATD has an existing tool (https://capmetro.atxvisionzero.xyz/) that we (ATD and CapMetro) use to identify bus stops that should be evaluated for improvement, relocation or closure in order to improve bus operations and safety (what we call “bus stop optimization”). Bus stops are assigned a score based on a variety of metrics (ridership, distance from a safe crossing, etc.), and that score is used to help us prioritize stops to focus limited resources on for improvement. The tool has not been updated over the last 1+ year to include recent data, and it does not include equity as a metric for scoring bus stops. Not having an up-to-date tool that includes equity as a metric makes it a challenge to identify stops for further project development.

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

Updating the existing ""CapMetro Stop Scores"" tool (https://capmetro.atxvisionzero.xyz/) with recent data, and adding equity as a measure in that tool.

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

We have an updated tool that can be used to identify bus stops for improvement, relocation or closure, and we are able to integrate that updated tool into our 2020 bond planning work that's currently being supported by a consultant team.

> Users

ATD and Capital Metro staff

> Sponsorship

Transit Enhancement Program - Eric Bollich, Anna Martin

> Which Strategic Direction 2023 “Mobility” indicators would this new application impact?

['System efficiency and congestion', 'Accessibility to and equity of multi-modal transportation choices', 'Safety']

> Which Austin Strategic Mobility Plan goals would this new application support?

['Commuter Delay – Reduce the amount of time workers spend traveling between home and work.', 'Travel Choice — Promote a balanced transportation network and the ability to make informed choices based on personal needs and preferences.', 'Health & Safety — Protect Austinites by lowering the risk of travel-related injury and promoting public health.', 'Affordability — Lower the cost of traveling in Austin by providing affordable travel options.', 'Sustainability — Promote integrated designs and quality additions to the built environment while reducing impacts and promoting efficient use of public resources.', 'Placemaking — Build a transportation network that encourages social interaction through quality urban design, and connects users to the many places that make Austin unique.', 'Economic Prosperity — Promote economic growth for individuals and the city through strategic investments in transportation networks that meet the needs of the 21st century.', 'Innovation — Draw inspiration from forward-looking cities around the world, change the way we think about what’s possible, and set an example for the rest of the country.']

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

If this tool cannot be updated in the short term (by September 16), I will work with a consultant team to determine how they can make an update by that September deadline.

> Is there anything else we should know?

I’d ideally like it to be completed by September 16th (4 weeks). If that’s not possible, it would be helpful to know what is possible within that timeframe. Besides just needing to use this tool to inform ongoing bus stop optimization work, we’d like to pull the data from the tool into a separate bus delay analysis tool (BDAT) that is in development for ATD by a consultant team. This BDAT tool is being used to help us identify and prioritize larger corridors for bond-funded transit improvement projects. The next step in that corridor identification and prioritization process starts 9/19, and if we can’t get the bus stop tool back up and running by then, or can get it up and running but can’t complete the requested updates, I’ll need to come up with a plan B for including that bus stop information into the BDAT.

Hello,

I am unable to complete tasks/attempts in AMANDA for approving/rejecting License Agreements etc. I should have the same user permission as Ravi Dhamrat, who upon clicking a license agreement is given a popup to fulfill the task, which I am not given. This prevents me from using AMANDA for approvals and therefor rely on Ravi to submit the action.

The only difference between our process is that Ravi assigns *himself* from the ATD reviewer, whereas for me, *he* changed the assignment to me. This could be causing the bug, or it could be my account. I have not yet tested if assigning it myself fixes the issue.

# Background
- There was a work order that had a request from Working Stock for `3` - `12 inch Tunnel Visor w/Universal Clips` 
- There was some back and forth on if it should be on Warehouse Inventory

## Transaction Information
- 16532 - was checked out 3 items - `12 inch Tunnel Visor w/Universal Clips` (Working Stock)
- 16684 - was replenished - from warehouse to working stock
- 17461 - was the return on the 3 items - `12 inch Tunnel Visor w/Universal Clips` 
  - this was pulling the Unit Cost from (Working Stock) in 16532

Ronnie said that was inaccurate and should be - `$26.7235`, it was showing up as `$26.000`
- I ended up removing the link between 16532 and 17461
- I tried to override the Unit Cost (Final) with Ronnie - it worked, we changed it to `$26.7235`
- I reset the connection between 16532 and 17461

Hello, I need help creating a interactive form/questionnaire  (I think sharepoint may be best) to help Finance with transaction requests.  Would like the form to be able to be submitted, send to our Task email then also approved - it needs to have a workflow for completion and approval (if all that makes sense).   Happy to answer questions and give more info - just reach out to me when possible.  Thank you so much!

The intent of the fellowship is to magnify the government technology profession, create a pipeline for technologists who are interested in a future in local government, and complement the growth of the DTS team. 

Fellows will work in partnership with the Data & Technology Services team and other divisions in the Transportation Department. They will receive mentorship in area-specific positions and work on current projects with the DTS team. 

The Fellowship is a 4-month to a 1-year commitment. During the last month of the Fellowship it is understood that the Fellow will pursue outside career opportunities and the DTS team will support the Fellow in this search.

This ticket is to track the creation of that flow, including getting feedback from the dev & product teams. It will also include some brief documentation (see #9998) about how to use the deployment system as well.

These should include listings of dynamic values such as endpoint URLs and the certain environment variables which are generated uniquely for each deployment. 

Additionally, this ticket should include a brief bit of research on what logging, event result searching, and other systems available to us via the prefect cloud service. How this issue is tackled should be shaped by this new learning.

One of the paths that Joseph Alberts uses to fill out banners work orders navigates him to the old work order view. We need the links updated to direct him to the correct work order page.

This is copied from a Banner customer's email about an issue with the payment portal. 

Good morning,
I am trying to make a payment for our two approved banners for The Austin Center for Grief & Loss.  I am in an account circle.
When I enter my email and password, I receive a password error, password doesn’t match.  I then go to reset password, and I receive the message that my email doesn’t exsist.  I go to Register Now and I receive the message that my email is already registered.  

Thank you for your assistance.

"1327748567","9930","open","Backlog","Backend PostGIS updates for all geometry fields",,"We currently store components' spatial data in a `jsonb` column in the `moped_proj_features` [table](https://db-docs.austinmobility.io/atd-moped-staging/tables/moped_proj_features.html).

We should use native PostGIS `geometry` columns to store spatial data. This will allow us to perform spatial queries and other operations against our component data. 

See scoping effort [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/9741).

## Goal
*  Begin to store geometry natively in our database
*  Gain access to all the GIS functions provided by PostGIS
*  Gain access to GIS functions provided by `graphql-engine`
*  Gain access to geographically aware indexing
*  Ease future integrations with ESRI's GIS suite

## Task Process
### Identify geographic data stored as GeoJSON or pairs of `float` fields
* Create a list of each column or pairs of columns which stores GeoJSON or some other geographic data
* Record if each represents a `Point`, `LineString`, or `Polygon` type geometry, or a more complex combination
* Record if each record's data encodes a single geometry or a collection of geometries
* Record at least that the projection is well defined or determine what is being used if not for each column
* Record and assess any properties or attributes encoded in GeoJSON and how that will be retained.
### Create new columns for data
#### Geometry columns
* The columns should be named in a non-generic way and avoid keywords. (`geom`, `geometry`, etc 👎🏻)
* The columns should be typed as specifically as possible. 
  * If certain geometries come in a variety of dimensions, careful consideration should be taken to either remediate them into a uniform dimension or utilize multiple columns, one for points and one for lines, etc.
* The columns should all have a defined SRID and the group should come to consensus on what SRID that should be. 
  * I suggest 2277: [NAD83 / Texas Central (ftUS)](https://epsg.io/2277).
 #### Ancillary columns for storing properties and attribute data
* The typing and schema of the new columns depends on the data found, but generally these choices are driven by the data found
### Populate the geometry columns
* For records with well formed GeoJSON, this may be accomplished with an `UPDATE` statement.
* For those with more complex situations, a python script may be required.
### Deprecate storage mechanism for GeoJSON data
* Delete the columns which contain the GeoJSON
* Update the Moped Application / graphql mutations to use the new columns
  * PostGIS offers functions to generate native geometry from GeoJSON and ability to produce GeoJSON from native geometries, so this hopefully is a manageable, but certainly non-trivial, task. 
  * This is the lion share of this task's work.
* Views can be used to expose the native geometry in a format that is more readily accepted by the application as well.

## Acceptance Criteria
* All geometries are stored using native PostGIS geometry
* No GeoJSON or GeoJSON-like blobs are used in the Moped Database
* App passes all related tests from the testing script
* `moped_proj_features.feature.properties` attributes are accounted for

With the AMANDA upgrade I'm not able to access various items. The training module shows you could customize toolbar for Cashier - but I don't have that selection to choose. Do I still have cashier rights?
Also, monthly I run an AMANDA ""FDU Revenue Report with Waivers (51036)"", but when I try I get an error saying No Data Found.

I need this soon because I am not able to enter payments in AMANDA. Nor am I able to run the AMANDA Waiver report for July 2022 to make the deadline for month end on 8/4/22.

In Amanda 6 I used to run a report (51036) to track our revenue collected and I have tried finding that report in Amanda 7 in the data reporting section but I don't see it.  I use this report to track our revenue by source code and compare it to the Controller's data so we can know what revenue hasn't posted yet that we need to account for.

One method discussed to aid in the testing and updating of our flows is to create a new dockerized-agent configuration which installs the latest prefect libraries, in effect, creating a test environment to work with the new API.

A user with editor access should be able to create a new note

- [ ] Conditionally display form field for ""Date"" and ""Note"" text if user is an editor. Hide when user only has read-only access
- [ ] When the user clicks ""Add"" button, send a graphQL mutation to insert a new record into the `notes` table.

_An open question we may need to re-address in the `notes` DB schema is if we need to store the `created_by` data as a user_id or as an email address. This depends on what's easiest to pull from Auth0, our user management and external authentication database/provider. We'll need to reference the the Users/Staff page to review queries and Auth0 data._

> Describe the problem.

Using https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/8059, I'd like to focus on Vulnerable User Analysis (Pedestrians, eScooters, and Bicyclists) using the VIN of the motor vehicle and the interaction with the vulnerable user.

> Describe the solution you have in mind.

Using the VIN decoder we can see additional data points that could lead to safer outcomes in interactions between motor vehicles and vulnerable users.

> How will we know that our solution is successful?

Identifying characteristics of the roadway, motor vehicle, vulnerable user, or others that could assist us in marketing plans or safety recommendations.

We'd like to have to button to these forms available on the Jobs | Markings page and on the My Work Orders page for the technicians. Another page will need to be created for the Supervisors to see the historical pre-trip and post-trip forms. Attached is the current paper forms for pre-trip and post trip that we are wanting to replicate in the Signs and Markings app.

## Scope & Deliverables

We will create a ROW Performance dashboard that incorporates data from:
- AMANDA

> Describe the problem.

Request from HR/Equity:  Every semester students here in the GIS department at ACC work on a service-learning project where they volunteer their knowledge, skills, and abilities to complete a set of GIS projects for a local agency or organization.  This is an opportunity for them to gain real-world experience while benefiting the community.

Previously, students have collaborated with TreeFolks, the Southwest Travis County Groundwater Conservation District, the City of Sunset Valley, and more.  As you can see in those links provided, students work on a variety of projects.  

We would love to collaborate with the City of Austin to develop a list of projects that you might be interested in having students complete.  They would begin the projects mid-semester and finish up the projects near the end of the semester - about 8 weeks total.  The time obligation on your end is quite minimal.  We will develop the project statement to work (similar to those links above) after discussing your project ideas with you.  After that, we just ask that you meet with us and the students for a kick-off meeting to get the ball rolling and then again for a showcase meeting where they present their results to you.

> Describe the problem.

AMD is getting ready to roll out citywide Signal Cabinet Security Upgrades.  We need to issue WRKs to all signals so e-locks (inventory) are charged to appropriate location.  Can DTS help to create a batch of WRKs for this purpose.   There will be 2-3 inventory items per signal (per WRK).  

Additionally -- after project is completed we'll need to add serial number information from vendor website to traffic signal assets - cabinet front door, cabinet back door and BBS cabinet

> Describe the outcome you'd like to see when this feature is implemented.

ATD deployment staying on target by not having to create 1100 individual work tickets in data tracker. 

> Describe any workarounds you currently have in place or alternative solutions you've considered.

Besides assigning e-locks to each location (via serial number thru vendor application)  he will have to create one work order per location to charge the lock to inventory.  

> Is there anything else we should know?

Mid August - pilot corridor (25-30 signals)
Mid September - expected deployment of e-locks to 50 signals
October - September - e-locks citywide.

## Background

When a traffic control plan is required an applicant must submit a plan to Right of Way Management for review. TCP review is partially managed across three platforms: AMANDA, Outlook, and the ROW Portal. Using Outlook as a case management tool for TCP review can lead to many negative outcomes including decreased customer service, loss of data integrity, double data entry, and missed deadlines. 

We intend to upgrade the current TCP Review mod on the The ROW Portal to provide end-to-end case management features for the entire TCP review workflow (other than those we are required to use AMANDA for). 

## Scope & Deliverables

Features we are considering to achieve end-to-end case management features include:

- A public facing web portal to allow customers to submit plans for intake and resubmittals.  
- Implementation of advanced iterative review management features, as seen in the TIA Mod. 
- Creation of a new workflow to manage completeness check 
- Features to track fee and Cost of Service Data

## Desired Outcomes

1. Customers use a web portal to initiate TCP plan review submittals. 
2. Internal staff no longer have to manually create TCP cases in the ROW Portal.
4. We will be able to map TCP plan data to it’s related data in AMANDA. 
5. Applicants and staff will receive automated emails to assist the workflow.
