Also, I learned new nuances to recycling behaviors each time, which was really interesting. I liked the collaborative approach, and that these meetings offered me an opportunity to interact with others in my field, yet from different agencies. At first, this was one of the biggest draws to my interest in participating. It was a delightful deviation from the typical sit-n-listen meetings and really afforded participants the chance to interact in a way that not only helped the project (I hope!),  but that also strengthened our working relationships, which fosters cross-agency collaboration. I would add that while the remote participation is a good gesture, the nature of these meetings really requires in-person participation. I tried attending remotely once, and quickly realized that the value extends beyond the presentation - which is really the only part that can be digested while attending remotely. It is a tricky balance between wanting to be flexible for participants (and decreasing the need to add to Austin's traffic issues) and recognizing the magic that happens with face-to-face interaction.",,,,"Yes","Austin ISD ","ARR shareout","Share-out of research findings from the Recycling Behaviors project (December 15, 2016)","http://projects.austintexas.io/resource-recovery/"
