That is then entered into a master excel spreadsheet for the department. The KPI evaluates two measures from the spreadsheet and relies on a spatial count of how many signs are in the network. The data is then extrapolated by the number of years the manufacturer can guarantee a 70% life cycle of the material. The data counts are then multiplied by the year and then divided by the spatial count in the network to come up with the percentage % of signs in ""Fair to Excellent"" condition. We've recently developed processes to come up with the measure. In years past the way the percentage of signs were produced was extrapolated from an un-vetted process making this KPI questionable. "
