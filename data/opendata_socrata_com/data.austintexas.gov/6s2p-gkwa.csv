"2016-11-28T21:25:24.000","10","You guys are magnificent!  Each and every one of you!  Because of the current political climate in our particular profession - (police), our supervisory and managerial staff are understandably very risk averse.  No one wants to be singled out for taking a chance and finding that it is not supported up the chain of command or that it is criticized by the community.  Our police staff have to be more focused upon protecting their careers by not doing anything wrong, than focused upon advancing the profession with new and innovative ideas.  

Your Idea Accelerator was wonderful in injecting energy and possibilities into our world.  The fact that you simply asked us, here at the bottom of the pyramid, what we would like to do if given the support, the guidance, and the resources was enough to spark our creative juices and make us feel like we are important, intelligent beings who can come up with creative ideas to move our City forward.  The fact that you simply asked the question, and that you were willing to take our responses seriously was, in and of itself, a great morale boost.

You also removed many layers of bureaucracy that would have quickly snuffed the life out of any idea that I might have had on my own.  

Your office generates a fountain of  energy that is contagious and that breathes life into the system.   And you have concrete skills and tools that can help make things actually happen.  

Thank you for what you are doing, and thanks to the City of Austin staff who put this all in place.  Keep it up the good work! ","Coaching/mentoring, Skills workshop(s)/training(s), Consulting on a particular challenge/project",,"Other staff have listened to our description of the project and have jumped on board and pitched in.  I am definitely feeling the ripple effects of the energy you put in to this and it is still rippling outward.  I no longer have to rely only to you for support, but my co-workers and supervisory staff are now enthusiastically a part of this project.  There is a lot of work ahead but we are already gaining from what is happening.  Thanks!"

They are rock stars!","Coaching/mentoring, Skills workshop(s)/training(s), Idea Accelerator project support","Financial Services / Capital COntracting Office (CCO) ","With their help I was able to get a new perspective of our processes through fresh eyes.

It was an enormous process, and you were great at keeping the momentum going! Well done!! Suggestioned improvements for version 2.0: Some procedures were not as clear as they could have been. Through conversations with your office and through your online material I had certain understandings about how things would happen, only to later find out in key instances that was not the case, ie. funding procedures, timeframe to get consults with fellows. I also personally found the website to be hard to negotiate.","Coaching/mentoring, Skills workshop(s)/training(s), Consulting on a particular challenge/project, Facilitation of group sessions","CPIO","Our project is going great, but a bit slow.  Most of my team has only been given small amounts of time to work on this during work (we are using that for team meetings). Bulk of the project has been done on our own time. I do not believe that our team's departments fully perceive the value of the Idea Accelerator (CPIO, CODE, APD, CTM is the exception).  Our team is very grateful to have been given a chance to work on a larger meaningful project, to be able to use our creativity and to work outside our normal job descriptions. Thanks!!!!"
