"w8wn-kuii","1:100 Flood Map (1% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/100 or a 1% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

"cfsx-vphq","Community Disorder Statistics Map","In addition to monitoring crime levels, the Calgary Police Service uses a range of types of calls for service (CFS) to monitor levels of ""Disorder."" Research indicates that disorder can have a negative impact on public perceptions of safety. Disorder is often highly visible, occurring in public spaces; drunks, panhandling, youth gangs, prostitution, littering, loitering and graffiti are examples of signals of social and physical disorder. A very low proportion of disorder-based calls for service result in crime reports.

Disorder CFS included are: Drunk, Disturbance, Indecent Act, Landlord/tenant, Mental health concern, Neighbor dispute, Party complaint, Suspicious person, Threats, Drugs, Noise complaint, Possible gunshots, Unwanted guest/patron, Prostitution, Speeder, Suspicious Auto (grouped as Social Disorder), Property damage and Abandoned auto (grouped as Physical Disorder).

Only public-generated call types are included: Advised, Callback, and Dispatched (police-generated calls are excluded). All dispositions are included.

Events are assigned to communities based on the geocode in CAD. Count is by single event.

Data source: Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) run on the 4th of the month (or the closest business day) for the previous month. This data is considered to be static. Property Damage occurrences reported using the online reporting system are included from the CPS records management system (SENTRY). This data is considered to be cumulative.

"ra69-5af5","1:8 Flood Map (12.5% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft) 

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/8 or a 12.5% chance of occurring in any year.

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

The data shows varying degrees of a roof’s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn’t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof’s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures built after 2012 that may obstruct another building’s solar exposure.  

The Yield levels are measured as kWh\m2\day.  Yield values are interpreted as:  Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)

The official designated flood elevation indicated by the text applies within the section of the river between the two lines (one upstream and one downstream) where the number is written. An annotation file with the elevations is provided separately as an attachment (see ""About"" menu).
These flood elevations reference Calgary’s Regulatory Flood Map (available separately). The Regulatory Flood Map shows the floodway, flood fringe and overland flood zones. The map is used for land planning purposes, showing the designated flood zones where various development and building regulations apply. The map shows the regulatory flood zones for the Bow River, Elbow River, Nose Creek and West Nose Creek. 

For more on the development and building regulations that apply in each designated flood zone, please refer to Calgary’s Land Use Bylaw, Part 3 Division 3.  http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Calgary-Land-Use-bylaw-1P2007/Calgary-Land-Use-Bylaw-1P2007.aspx

"wz77-hq7u","1:500 Flood Map (0.2% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/500 or a 0.2% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

Violence:  These figures include all violent crime offences as defined by the Centre for Canadian Justice Statistics Universal Crime Reporting (UCR) rules.  Domestic violence is excluded. Break and Enter:   Residential B&E includes both House and ‘Other’ structure break and enters due to the predominantly residential nature of this type of break in (e.g. detached garages, sheds).

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/200 or a 0.5% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

"gc28-8znr","1:1000 Flood Map (0.1% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/1000 or a 0.1% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding. 

More information on flood mapping for Calgary is available at https://calgary.ca/flood

"trwk-drxj","Solar Potential 2020 (images-.tiff)","Using data collected in 2020, The City has created this solar potential dataset of all buildings within city limits. The data shows varying degrees of a roof’s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn’t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof’s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures captured after 2020 that may obstruct another building’s solar exposure.

The Yield levels are measured as kWh\m2\day. Yield values are interpreted as: Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)

The compressed file for download is 362 MB. The uncompressed files are 4.46  GB. Data is arranged in Townships, with 21 GeoTiff image files in total.

The Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool.

"3q69-wm6a","Regulatory Flood Hazard Map Steplines","Step lines define the regulatory flood elevation levels within the floodway/flood fringe. The official designated flood elevation indicated by the text applies within the section of the river between the two lines (one upstream and one downstream) where the number is written. An annotation file with the elevations is provided separately as an attachment (see ""About"" menu).
These flood elevations reference Calgary’s Regulatory Flood Map (available separately). The Regulatory Flood Map shows the floodway, flood fringe and overland flood zones. The map is used for land planning purposes, showing the designated flood zones where various development and building regulations apply. The map shows the regulatory flood zones for the Bow River, Elbow River, Nose Creek and West Nose Creek. 

For more on the development and building regulations that apply in each designated flood zone, please refer to Calgary’s Land Use Bylaw, Part 3 Division 3.  http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Calgary-Land-Use-bylaw-1P2007/Calgary-Land-Use-Bylaw-1P2007.aspx 

Are you building or renovating? 
If you are building or renovating, check the regulatory flood map on this page, and the 1:100 year inundation map (from Flooding in Calgary: Maps http://www.calgary.ca/UEP/Water/Pages/Flood-Info/Calgary-flood-maps/Flood-maps.aspx) to see if your property is in a flood risk zone.  Since late 2011, property owners have been advised of both the official designated flood elevation per the Land Use Bylaw (based on this regulatory flood map) and the most up to date recommended flood elevation (based on the updated 1:100 year inundation map) for their specific property.","official","map","Environment","100 year,bylaw,floodplain,floodway,fringe,hazard,steplines","https://data.calgary.ca/d/3q69-wm6a","https://data.calgary.ca/resource/3q69-wm6a.json","2017-12-14T23:54:50.000","2022-01-20T22:33:47.000","2017-12-15T00:01:20.000","true","848","128",,,"See Terms of Use","The City of Calgary",,"mngv-ufjz",,"Irregular",,,"https://data.calgary.ca/d/Open-Data-Terms/u45n-7awa","Water Resources and Water Services","http://www.calgary.ca/UEP/Water/Pages/Flood-Info/Calgary-flood-maps/Flood-maps.aspx#hazard",,,"The City of Calgary","WGS84/Web Mercator","Yes",

"65h7-2au2","1:1000 Flood Map (0.1% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/1000 or a 0.1% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

The cordon count is performed at 31 locations around the CBD over a three week time period, collecting data on how people travel into and out of downtown Calgary. The CBD cordon circles the downtown with the Bow River to the north and the railway tracks to the south and from 11 Street in the west to the Elbow River in the east. These data represent the total number of persons entering (inbound) and exiting (outbound) at each location, by modes, during a 16 hour time period. This raw dataset is NOT normalized to average weekday. It is a snapshot of the inbound and outbound activity on a single day at these locations and reflects conditions specific to that day such as construction, lane closures, weather, etc. Therefore, data may not be directly comparable between locations or years.

"8rfi-nymv","1:50 Flood Map (2% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft)

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/50 or a 2% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/5 or a 20% chance of occurring in any year.

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

The NAICS sub-sectors included in this study are: Accommodation and Food Services (NAICS code 72), Retail Trade (44-45), Manufacturing (31-33), Health Care and Social Assistance (62), and Public Administration (91). All businesses and organizations included in the study were customers of The City’s Commercial Collections service, except for one privately-serviced customer in the Accommodation and Food Services sub-sector that was added to provide better sector representation. A total of 115 samples are included in the dataset: 30 in Accommodation and Food Services, 35 in Retail Trade, 17 in Manufacturing, 25 in Health Care and Social Assistance, and 8 in Public Administration. The weight per cent for each sub-sector is the pooled average of samples collected in the four seasons of 2019.

The NAICS sub-sectors included in this study are: Accommodation and Food Services (NAICS code 72), Retail Trade (44-45), Manufacturing (31-33), Health Care and Social Assistance (62), and Public Administration (91).  All businesses and organizations included in the study were customers of The City’s Commercial Collections service, except for one privately-serviced customer in the Accommodation and Food Services sub-sector that was added to provide better sector representation.  A total of 115 samples are included in the dataset:  30 in Accommodation and Food Services, 35 in Retail Trade, 17 in Manufacturing, 25 in Health Care and Social Assistance, and 8 in Public Administration.  The weight per cent for each sub-sector is the pooled average of samples collected in the four seasons of 2019.

The data shows varying degrees of a roof’s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn’t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof’s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures built after 2018 that may obstruct another building’s solar exposure.

The Yield levels are measured as kWh\m2\day. Yield values are interpreted as: Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)

The compressed file for download is 326 MB. The uncompressed files are 3.95 GB. Data is arranged in Townships, with 21 GeoTiff image files in total.

The Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool.

"6crx-xp99","1:8 Flood Map (12.5% chance of occurring in any year)","(Note: Updated inundation maps for 1:2 to 1:1000 floods are available from Alberta Environment and Parks (2020). The new draft maps can be viewed here: https://floods.alberta.ca/?app_code=FI&mapType=Draft) 

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/8 or a 12.5% chance of occurring in any year.

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

"tp6q-x2v7","Regulatory Flood Map (Bylaw Flood Hazard)","Calgary’s Regulatory Flood Map shows the floodway, flood fringe and overland flood zones. The map is used for land planning purposes, showing the designated flood zones where various development and building regulations apply. The map shows the regulatory flood zones for the Bow River, Elbow River, Nose Creek and West Nose Creek. An annotation file is provided separately as an attachment (see ""About"" menu"").

Designated flood elevations (or steplines) associated with these zones are available separately. 

For more on the development and building regulations that apply in each designated flood zone, please refer to Calgary’s Land Use Bylaw, Part 3 Division 3.  http://www.calgary.ca/PDA/pd/Pages/Calgary-Land-Use-bylaw-1P2007/Calgary-Land-Use-Bylaw-1P2007.aspx 

Are you building or renovating? 
If you are building or renovating, check the regulatory flood map on this page, and the 1:100 year inundation map (from Flooding in Calgary: Maps http://www.calgary.ca/UEP/Water/Pages/Flood-Info/Calgary-flood-maps/Flood-maps.aspx) to see if your property is in a flood risk zone.  Since late 2011, property owners have been advised of both the official designated flood elevation per the Land Use Bylaw (based on this regulatory flood map) and the most up to date recommended flood elevation (based on the updated 1:100 year inundation map) for their specific property.

These inundation maps show whether a property is at risk for various sized river floods. The size of flood shown on this map has a 1/500 or a 0.2% chance of occurring in any year. 

The three distinct types of inundation shown on the maps are:
o	Inundation - Area flooded overland due to riverbank overtopping.
o	Isolated - Low lying areas that will not be wet from riverbank overtopping, but may experience groundwater seepage or stormwater backup.
o	Potential failure of flood protection barrier - Low lying areas that could be flooded if an existing permanent flood protection barrier were to fail.

The flood areas shown were mapped in 2015 jointly by Alberta Environment and Parks and the City of Calgary, using the best available hydrologic and hydraulic data and models. As such, the flooding shown reflects 2015 conditions, hydrology and topography. The effects of mitigation measures (changes to reservoirs/dams or barriers) built since 2015 are not included. There is uncertainty inherent in predicting the effects of flood events, and this uncertainty increases for floods with less than a 1% chance of occurrence in any year. Any use of this data must recognizing the uncertainty with regards to the exact location and extent of flooding.

"5ke3-c93z","Solar Potential 2012-2017 (images-.tiff)","Using data collected between 2012 and 2017, The City has created this solar potential dataset of all buildings within city limits. The data shows varying degrees of a roof’s solar exposure, on an annual basis, in generalized optimal conditions. The data model used to generate the map takes into account the shape of the terrain and the relative position of building rooftops and structures, existing infrastructure, and tree canopies. It doesn’t take into account weather conditions, such as cloudy days and precipitation that limit a roof’s direct solar exposure. It also does not reflect any new adjacent structures built after 2012 that may obstruct another building’s solar exposure. 

The Yield levels are measured as kWh\m2\day. Yield values are interpreted as: Low Yield (0 - 0.87); Low Moderate Yield (0.87 - 1.74); High Moderate Yield (1.74 - 2.61); High Yield (2.61 - 3.48)

The compressed file for download is 4.25 GB. The uncompressed files are 4.5 GB. Data is arranged in Townships, with 18 GeoTiff image files in total.

The Solar map data is intended for information purposes only and as a preliminary solar opportunity assessment tool. It is not intended to be used as a decision making source of information for solar panel installations.","official","file","Environment",,"https://data.calgary.ca/d/5ke3-c93z","https://data.calgary.ca/resource/5ke3-c93z.json","2018-09-25T15:22:44.000","2021-08-03T14:53:55.000","2018-09-25T15:22:44.000","false","311","113",,,"See Terms of Use","The City of Calgary",,,"LiDAR","None",,,"https://data.calgary.ca/d/Open-Data-Terms/u45n-7awa","Corporate Analytics and Innovation",,"2012-2017",,"The City of Calgary","EPSG:4326 WGS84","Yes",

Data is provided monthly by the Calgary Police Service. This includes both crime and disorder statistics.

Crime count is based on the most serious violation (MSV) per incident.  Violence:  These figures include all violent crime offences as defined by the Centre for Canadian Justice Statistics Universal Crime Reporting (UCR) rules.  Domestic violence is excluded. Break and Enter:   Residential B&E includes both House and ‘Other’ structure break and enters due to the predominantly residential nature of this type of break in (e.g. detached garages, sheds).  B&Es incidents include attempts.

Disorder events consist of Social and Physical disorder. Only public-generated calls are included. 
Social disorder includes: Drunk, Disturbance, Indecent Act, Juvenile Complaint, Landlord/tenant, Mental health concern, Neighbor dispute, Party complaint, Prowler, Suspicious person, Threats, Drugs, Noise complaint, Possible gunshots, Unwanted guest/patron, Prostitution, Speeder, Suspicious Auto.
Physical disorder includes: Fire, Property damage and Abandoned auto. 

**Resident counts are pulled from census data which is collected Apr/May of each year and apply to community crime stats from June of current year to May of the following year.
