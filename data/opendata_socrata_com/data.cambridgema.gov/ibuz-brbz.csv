Footbridge across the train tracks from further in on CambridgePark Dr to allow a second means of access and egress. There could even be available parking on the other side so people could drive to that side, parks, and walk across the bridge into the office park
2. Clearer bike path infrastructure for commuters, pressure Cambridge to connect biking infrastructure around Fresh Pond to the paths along Memorial Drive. Huge safety benefit for biking commuters.
3. Mirror on the bike path just northwest of Jerry's Pond where the footpath from Rt 2 hits the bike path. It's a very blind intersection for bikes coming out of that footpath and I have witness several (not-too-dangerous) collisions.
4. Car bridge across the train tracks from further in on CambridgePark Dr, more expensive than #1, but more directly beneficial to many.","Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Staples, TJ Maxx, Food Trucks, Genki Ya","The fence around the pond"

But it's not a deal breaker. The thing I REALLY pine for is a cool, yummy sandwich shop like Darwin's, or Flour, or Tatte Bakery. Au Bon Pain and Subway are meh; Four Burgers is a little heavy when you just want a good sandwich. I LOVE Falafel Palace and Life Alive and Picante, too, but I REALLY wish there were a tasty, innovative sandwich place. Obviously, because I'm a 9-5er in the square, lunch is my main expenditure. And I shop a LOT at the Prospect Whole Foods.
And, because I'm not in Arlington (where I live) during the work day, I'm happy to have shoe repair and clothing alterations here in the square.","[Question Not Included in This District's Survey]","[Question Not Included in This District's Survey]"

In that time I have lived and worked in Central Sq.. The planners dropped the ball twenty years ago. What was a thriving commercial district full of small independent businesses was decimated in order to satisfy carpet-bagging developers along with others including politicians who only saw a quick buck to be made. It's no surprise to me that Carl Barron Plaza can't ever achieve full capacity. How many banks and cell phone stores do we really need in Central Sq.?  What happened to Davis Sq. in Somerville or Jamaica Plain should have happened in Central Sq.. Instead, those in power obviously attempted to make it be just like every mall in America, full of chain stores that are not well suited to the situation. One by one they left, leaving nothing but empty space behind. Unfortunately current rents for commercial space have risen to a point which has driven many longtime businesses out and is still threatening most of the others, I know this to be a fact from my longtime relationships with some current and many former business owners in the area. I wish you luck in solving the underlying problems which currently exist in Central Sq.. All of which were created by the shortsighted greed and avarice of your predecessors.","[Question Not Included in This District's Survey]","[Question Not Included in This District's Survey]"

Also, it is annoying to have bums waiting at the lights every day walking along the cars to collect money.  The same people.  I don't know if they really need money and can't work for whatever reasons.  But it's not safe since the road is so narrow I'm always afraid of hitting these people.  Maybe the city should do a story on them and set up a GOFUND me account which would be safer if they really can't work.",,

THIS SURVEY DOES NOT ALLOW MULTIPLE RESPONSES FOR PLACES I SHOP, ETC SINCE I DO ALL THESE ACTIVITIES IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS.   Also -- I got to Central Square MORE than once a week but less than every day, which the SURVEY doesn't allow.

Central Square could use a boutique hotel or hostel.  Might be greatly improved if you could get rid of the wet shelter (CASPAR) and attendant problems.  Many friends from out of town feel threatened, and I've been assaulted and robbed myself (nothing serious).

If you look back at the building permit process you will quickly realize the traffic on the road is grossly understated during peak travel times. 

Add in Alewife garage traffic, bus traffic, and pedestrian traffic and you will see a cluster F***.

By the way, increase the parking price of the garage is not going to have any effect.  Those who take T will either park here in Alewife or the price is too high that they would rather drive in to Boston or Kendall and make other part of Cambridge even more congested 

The intersection here really needs a good 3-D bridge to alleviate traffic or the garage along this area to reduce the traffic coming in.. for example, a garage in Belmont outside Exit 60, Arlington and a garage in Cambridge around Mass Ave.  This will dramatically reduce the traffic to come in and service people from east on the east, service people from west on the west...

Increase parking in the current T or along Cambridge Park Drive is only going to get the problem worse and worse... as there will more and more cars coming in to the area...

We need to divert cars out to the surrounding area, if we want to keep the business here at the same time","bike path",

But keep the Wendy's and McD's if you have to so people can have some cheap food too. There is room for Rendevous down the street from Wendy's!! Also, find a good clothing retailer to come into the old Gap spot. That would be a huge boon to the area. Similar to Gap in HS. People will travel to the CS for a good clothes retailer.

It's bisected by 16/Alewife Brook Parkway. The Fresh Pond shopping center isn't walkable -- vast acres of parking lots & widely-spaced stores == need for cars. We need more walkways for people to use to get between the various shopping areas. 

The T station encourages the homeless to loiter nearby. The projects in close proximity to ritzy condo rentals and office buildings is very odd. The stores in the area seem to vary wildly between catering to the low-rent crowd (Radio Shack, McDs, ratty furniture store, down-at-heels theater) and the rich yuppies who live in Cambridge (Trader Joe's, Whole Foods). Right now, the area hasn't found its identity. More moderately-priced housing (and more of it) would bring a better balance to the area.","The T and the bike path are great. 

Bertucci's is pretty awesome, and Whole Foods is in a good place.

I like the office buildings, mostly, because it allows my commute to be relatively short.","Summer Shack is downright overpriced for what it is (Legal's is better). 

The plan to build condos across all the parking lots behind the CPD buildings is insane. You're building tons of buildings on a major flood plain -- it's just a disaster waiting to happen."

traffic is terrible here - entering/exiting alewife, going through the rotaries, etc.  if i didnt need to leave the area so early to avoid traffic i would be more likely to stop at stores after work.

changing the areas around alewife so that pedestrians/bikers only cross during red lights (ie no street-level crosswalks that are not at lights) would be great.  

also there is a lack of restaurants, especially within easy walking distance of cambridgepark drive.

alewife does not seem to be a safe area - i drive to work since i dont feel comfortable riding the t alone after dark or biking on the trails after dark.","trader joes, whole foods, homegoods",

First and foremost, the traffic at Alewife needs to be addressed. The lights are poorly timed causing back-ups into the Alewife garage and onto Route 2 in the evening. For example, the right turn from Cambridge Park Dr. onto Alewife Brook Pkwy is impeded because just as this light turns green the light at Ringe and Alewife Brook Pkwy turns red. Only 4 or 5 cars get through the light every cycle. Also, the MBTA should charge more for parking so drivers are encouraged to use the commuter rail.

With respect to transit, over the summer I have tried to drive less and use transit more. In doing so, I regularly use bus 83 from Ringe Ave transit center to Somerville. The bus only runs every 25 minutes during peak times and routinely runs off-schedule because of traffic. Higher frequency would encourage more people to use this transit center and would increase reliability.","The businesses in the area are great.

- Make the bike paths more obvious (e.g. paint or different color) so auto drivers know where they are
- Clear the sight paths at intersections where bikes/pedestrians cross so cars can see walkers/bikes without pulling into the intersection. Example - New st & FreshPond (near the rotary)
- add walker crossing lights at Cambridge Park Drive between the alewife/summershack access road and alewife parkway
- change the light pattern for the right turn from fresh pond pkwy eastbound that is across fromthe exit from the shoppingcenter. (The right that then goes to an access road under the parkway and into the Fresh Pond shopping area). Pedestrians and cars both have a ""green"" light simultaneously which is dangerous
- Add or turn on street lights all along alewife parkway and the general area - pedestrians are very difficult to see crossing the street after dark, and the area does not feel safe to walk in
- fix the congested traffic pattern at the whole foods end of the parking lot. Need a 2-lane passageway along the street side and more area for queuing getting to the exit
- make an additional eastbound lane at the eastern end of CampridgePark drive that is right-turn only to permit smoother flow for 2 lanes turning left to go west on rt 2 PLUS one lane that is going east to Fresh Pond, and eliminate jockeying 
- - make a better path for buses going from alewife station out to cambridgepark drive heading east so there is less congestion caused b blocking traffic",,

The traffic in cambridge park drive, their needs to be a second escape route for people who are leaving town vs people who are entering, we are in a dead end right betore both merge together, the ones entering and the ones leaving trap us, merge into us and bottleneck us. I know their is a train station making it hard to find an exist but even if their was a way to get to ringe ave out of a parking lot or something like that to get to the right it would give us all a huge break getting out. For the towns sake though move the people entering away from the people leaving its a terrible idea.

Parking here is bad also they are building a parking garage and it is hard  to get in and out sometimes bottlenecked for many minutes.","the good businesses, but they need to have good access to stay, I heard their is a chance they are going to build the parking garage last if that is the case in our area we will be out of parking for months on end and it will cause lots of business unable to park relying on district parking.","dead end road, needs to not be dead end."
