I propose that we place solar panels up top to create shade and shelter for the vehicles, like at Boston Airport's economy parking. Otherwise, it is just a large area of wasted space.

After grid-like framing of 2""X4"" studs was attached to the exterior of the old existing facade, and then added onto the 2""X4"" studs was a new wood facade. This resulted in the front of the store pushing out 5 inches. In other words, the sidewalk became 5 inches narrower and it is now the narrowest section of sidewalk on the block which has elderly housing with wheelchairs. The windows now sit deep in the swollen thick facade. The building inspector for this area of Cambridge won employee of the year. Either the owner had special permission to build out into the sidewalk unlike any other buildings on the block (hard to believe), or the builder did this expansion with the city building inspector having no clue.

One of these spots is the overpass over the train tracks near the BU Bridge, on the river side.  The sidewalk is very narrow between the rotary and the boathouse.  The adjacent road is much wider than vehicle-width yet not quite wide enough for two lanes.

At the Cedar St/Mass Ave intersection, they are currently forced to cross Cedar St., then wait on a little triangle (often full of bikes at peak times), and then cross Mass Ave. It would be much better for cyclists and pedestrians to have their own protected traffic light cycle to cross the street (a ""Barnes Dance"" design). Then bikers and walkers could go directly from the path to the path, without waiting through two light cycles. Plus they would be safer, because they would not be at risk from turning vehicles. I propose re-programming the traffic light, painting a diagonal ""crossing route"" for bikes and pedestrians, and putting up additional signage reminding drivers to look out for bikes and pedestrians at this intersection.","Not eligible through the PB process, not a capital project.

Street cleaning is held up by cars that need to be towed, people need to pay a lot of money once they find out their car has been towed, people spend a lot of time looking for their cars and looking for parking spots with frustration. I believe an app that tracks available parking spots, knows the exact days and exact streets of street cleaning and is able to alert car owners when those times approach, and is able to indicate where someone last parked their car would alleviate a lot of frustration.

4. Study mid-block crossings for pedestrians and bulb-outs

5. Study effect of reduced parking if using consistent bulb-outs for parking of bikes, and cleaning-up of sidewalk fixtures. E.g. Every 4th parking spot would be turned into a bulb-out for bicycle parking, trash receptacles, parking signage.

The biggest advance has been in the system control algorithms which now enable individual travel lines to have higher speed and capacity than traditional bus, car or subway. While it may seem counter-intuitive at first, a closer look would show that it is time to reevaluate PRT as a viable means of transportation. A properly engineered PRT would increase the capacity and speed of our transportation system. It also makes pedestrians and biking safer by reducing car travel. Reduction of car travel has added environmental benefits.  This system would benefit all Cambridge residents and be an example for other cities to follow. This idea would only require an easement on certain sidewalks to be tested and implemented.","To be determined","Stephen Filippone","citywide

Each spring people could sign up at the library for a plot and then plant what they want. People can pick fruits and vegetables from the plots.  Perhaps there should be a water fountain on the strip near the library so one can rinse and eat! Dog walkers can continue to use the strip as before, having a beautified communal place to walk their dogs. (People here do a good job of picking up after their dogs.) A couple benches and rocking chairs would be nice touches to send a message to enjoy the space.","Budget Delegates did not rank this as a high priority project.

This small change had an oversized impact to traffic and, subsequently, quality of life in my North Cambridge neighborhood. The reason for this is that the previous width of the street allowed cars continuing straight on Rindge Ave to go around those waiting to take a left on Sherman Street. Now, if one car waits to take a left, every other car behind them misses the light as well. This routinely causes backups all the way to the Peabody School. This is a largely residential area, so it impacts residents and those trying to drop their children off at school and make their way to work. My idea has two options: The first is to redraw the double yellow lines to accommodate cars continuing straight on Rindge Ave - so they do not have to wait behind those taking a left on Sherman Street. The second is to add a delayed green light allowing cars to take a left before those traveling the opposite direction get the green light.","Budget Delegates felt that this is a traffic timing issue and shared the idea with the Traffic Department.","Rich Goode","Rindge Avenue

Tulips are perennial and can be planted nearly anywhere - parks, intersections, trees growing along sidewalks. With 50 bulbs costing only $20, they're also a great deal. I propose we allocate $5,000  to planting tulips. With this, we could plant 12,500 of spring's prettiest flowers all around our wonderful city of Cambridge, bringing smiles to citizens and beautifying the neighborhoods! If the city has a bit more of its $800,000 to spare, we could allocate $17,600 and provide one free tulip to every household in Cambridge.

*adding a crosswalk at Norris Street (not raised, just lines)
*re-doing the sidewalks in brick or fake brick. All the concrete and pavement makes it feel it feel too broad and a different colored sidewalk would help.
*adding more trees to eventually create a canopy. Shade is welcome in the summer, and will help enclose the space so vehicles won't feel it's safe enough to speed.

We were asked to find a solution that would significantly reduce or re-purpose food waste in Cambridge by 2018. Our team's approach was to tackle the issue through education and technology. When students throw away leftovers, the scraps currently go to an outside composting facility. We proposed installing an anaerobic digester instead. Within the digester, microorganisms break down food scraps and produce biogas, fueling our stoves for the next meal. Our idea was to locate it at CRLS to use it as an educational opportunity for students.

The design possibilities--ranging from simple to decorative--can work to protect cyclists while using minimal street space. Traditional bike lanes are good at making cyclists feel safe and improve visibility, however they do not protect cyclists from dooring or from moving vehicles hazards.

However, given the enthusiasm many have for amateur astronomy (and the large academic population), it should be easy to find volunteers.  Ideally, there would be a rooftop location (or locations) with telescopes, and they would be open to the public every clear night of the year for observing.  Volunteers on hand could offer instruction, keep an eye on things, or occasionally take a more active role and host short classes if they like.","Budget Delegates did not move this proposal forward to the ballot, because the School Department advised that CRLS already has telescopes and that they are underutilized.  After checking with some of the science teachers, the School Deptartment did not recommend purchasing more.","Ken","City Hall, citywide

This is a design philosophy which states that products and facilities in the built environment should be designed to be maximally usable by everyone without special adaptations or retrofitting. What follows are eight examples of playground equipment that embrace the UD philosophy. Bundled together in a careful and thoughtful way, into a single City of Cambridge playground, they would comprise the City's first fully UD playground. The Clarendon Avenue Playground and the Morse School Playground are two prime potential candidates to locate the UD playground, but there could be others. (See attachment.)
