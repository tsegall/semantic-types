Four of these areas are in California. The San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose Urban Areas rank second and third, respectively. That the New York Metropolitan area ranks fifth on this list shows that this density ranking is greatly affected by the nature of the land area designated as urban. Census Urban Areas comprise an urban core and associated suburbs. California's urban and suburban areas are more uniform in density when compared to New York's urban core and suburban periphery which have vastly different densities.

Ranging from a Rand McNally-style roadway map and a regional transit map to a commute flow diagram and a diversity index, each map shows the viewer a geography of the region that differs and changes based upon the particular subject being considered or particular policy that is being confronted. In many cases, city and county boundaries do not matter, as the spatial units that are in focus can be much larger (air shed) or much smaller (priority development areas).

Pavement condition is represented by the Pavement Condition Index, which was developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers, ranges from a like-new condition of 100 to a failed condition of 0. The average PCI in the San Francisco Bay Area is 66. Pavement deterioration is primarily caused by distress from vehicle weight and aggravated by weather conditions. Local funding priorities also play a significant role in the condition of a road network. As an example, El Cerrito recently passed a self-help tax specifically for road and pavement preservation. As a result, nearly all of the road segments within the city limits are either in Excellent or Very Good Condition. In other areas, targeted improvements can stretch limited funds. The cities of Orinda recently passed funding measures for their street network and started by focusing on arterial streets. This ensures that although their very low traffic volume local roads have not been restored, nearly everyone in the community is able to immediately see benefits from their funding choice.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm1214.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm1214.pdf","December","12","2014","2014-12-17T00:00:00.000"

However, the movement of people from one state to another can have an even bigger influence on our country's economy, politics and culture than immigration. These two charts depict where California residents were born, and where they have moved to. The ribbons are color-coded by region, and foreign-born residents are included at the bottom, in gray, to complete the picture for each state. We know that California has long been the destination of American dreamers from other states. These days, California no longer plays that role. Our residents are leaving for greener pastures out East. Today, the state is still pulling in foreign immigrants, but the percentage of American-born transplants has shrunk significantly as fewer people move into the state. In 1960, half of California residents were born in another U.S. state. Today, that's down to 18 percent. There are growing pools of Californians in nearly every state. It's quite a switch because through 1990 California led the nation in retaining its native-born population. There are now about 6.8 million California natives living elsewhere, up from 2.7 million in 1980.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/sept2014.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/sept2014.pdf","September","9","2014","2014-09-28T00:00:00.000"

Then we superimposed the actual BART system as it stands today, along with new segments that are under construction. You can see that as originally conceived the core BART system (indicated by a solid light blue line) would have extended across the Golden Gate deep into Marin County, as well as traveling down the Peninsula on the West Side of the Bay to Palo Alto.

The growth in these areas is in fact driving much of the population growth across the nation. Upon closer examination of the data, this growth is the result of two very different migrations – one coming from the location choices of Americans themselves, the other shaped by where new immigrants from outside the United States are heading.
</p><p>While many metro areas are attracting a net-inflow of migrants from other parts of the country, in several of the largest metros – New York, L.A., and Miami, especially – there is actually a net outflow of Americans to the rest of the country. Immigration is driving population growth in these places. Sunbelt metros like Houston, Dallas, and Phoenix, and knowledge hubs like Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, and D.C. are gaining much more from domestic migration.</p><p>This map charts overall or net migration – a combination of domestic and international migration. Most large metros, those with at least a million residents, had more people coming in than leaving. The metros with the highest levels of population growth due to migration are a mix of knowledge-based economies and Sunbelt metros, including Houston, Dallas, Miami, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle, and Austin.

And this El Nino could be a big one. A strong El Niño doesn't guarantee record-breaking heat, but combined with the general trend of global warming, that possibility is looking increasingly likely. El Niño conditions transfer heat that's been building in the ocean into the atmosphere, affecting weather around the world. A protracted El Niño could bring relief to California's unprecedented drought in the form of heavy rains, but would likely add another year to the rising stack of broken temperature records.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm0715.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm0715.pdf","July","7","2015","2015-07-22T00:00:00.000"

Notably, the region’s two largest cities, San Jose and San Francisco, are on track to produce the level of housing envisioned in Plan Bay Area – if their relatively rapid year 2014 housing production rate continues in the years to come. The results are more mixed in the East Bay.

Location matters enormously. If you're poor and live in the San Francisco area, it's better to be in Contra Costa County than in San Francisco County or Alameda County. Not only that, the younger you are when you move to Contra Costa, the better you will do on average. Children who move at earlier ages are less likely to become single parents, more likely to go to college and more likely to earn more. Every year a poor child spends in Contra Costa County adds about $160 to his or her annual household income at age 26, compared with a childhood spent in the average American county. Over the course of a full childhood, which is up to age 20 for the purposes of this analysis, the difference adds up to about $3,200, or 12 percent, more in average income as a young adult.

When gasoline topped $4 a gallon, opponents of an increase in the gas tax argued that prices were already too high. Now that the average price of regular gas has dropped to under $2.50 a gallon, the anti-tax environment that pervades Washington shows little support for increasing the gas tax to finance the upkeep of the nation's roadways and public transit systems. This no-win dynamic is frustrating to advocates who had hoped falling gas prices might reinvigorate the idea of raising the gas tax, which they view as one of the simplest, fairest and most efficient ways to pay for transportation repairs and improvements. The latest discussions about raising the gas tax come as the Energy Information Administration estimates that the average American household will spend at least $550 less on gasoline next year than it did in 2014, a result of lower prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks that can travel farther on fewer gallons. The last time the gasoline tax was raised was in 1993, and even that 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase was not initially dedicated to transportation repair and capital improvements, but rather was part of President Clinton's budget-deficit reduction plan. That revenue stream was redirected to the federal Highway Trust Fund in 1997 Back then, the 18.4-cent tax on every gallon represented about 16 percent of the pump price. If the gas tax had kept pace with inflation it would be 30.1 cents today. The Trust Fund now faces a major decline of an estimated $160 billion deficit over the next 10 years.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm0115.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm0115.pdf","January","1","2015","2015-01-28T00:00:00.000"

In the U.S., the largest share of infrastructure spending is towards Roads, followed by Transit and Water. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), between 2003 and 2007, public spending on transportation and water infrastructure declined by $23 billion, or 6 percent. That decline, which reflects a decrease in real capital spending, especially by the federal government, stands in contrast to the fairly steady increase in spending for such infrastructure during the previous two decades. In particular, real capital spending on highways, mass transit, and aviation fell markedly even as capital spending on other types of infrastructure—such as rail and water transportation, water resources, and water supply and wastewater treatment—remained stable or rose.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm713.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm713.pdf","July","7","2013","2013-07-24T00:00:00.000"

However, by 2010 nearly twice the share of jobs was located at least 10 miles away from downtown (43%) as within 3 miles of downtown (23%).Job losses in industries hit hardest by the downturn, including construction and manufacturing, helped check employment decentralization in the late 2000s.In all but nine of the 100 largest metro areas, the share of jobs located within three miles of downtown declined during the 2000s.Metro areas showing the greatest increase in jobs in the 10-35 miles radius from downtown include: Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale, AZ, San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX, Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos, TX, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX, and Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX.Metro areas showing the greatest loss of jobs within the 3 mile radius of downtown include: North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL, Boise City-Nampa, ID, Jackson, MS, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX, Cape Coral-Fort Myers, FLSource:Job Sprawl Stalls: The Great Recession and Metropolitan Employment LocationMetropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institute.

The small jolt-and-roll caused no damage but served as a not-so-gentle reminder that the Bay Area rests upon a number of restless faults. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), there is a 72% likelihood that the Bay Area will experience a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake over the next 30 years. For context, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.9, was responsible for 63 deaths and severely damaged elevated transportation infrastructure in San Francisco and Oakland.  The fault with the greatest likelihood of earthquake is the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault, which runs roughly from East San Jose in Santa Clara County to Santa Rosa in Sonoma County. When considering earthquakes, it is important to remember that the magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning a 7.0 earthquake would release 33 times more energy than that of the 6.0 South Napa Earthquake which occurred in 2014.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_10_30_17.png",,"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mtcmotm/motm_10_13_17_Website.pdf","October","10","2017","2017-10-30T00:00:00.000"

This program provides grants to every state, certain local communities, and other organizations to purchase foreclosed or abandoned homes and to rehabilitate, resell, or redevelop these homes in order to stabilize neighborhoods and stem the decline of house values of neighboring homes. This map scores neighborhoods in the bay area on a scale of 1 to 20 where 20 indicates areas in the highest 20% of risk nationwide for home foreclosures and abandonment.  1 indicates areas with lowest risk. This ranking is based upon the following factors developed by HUD:    whether or not loans are high cost or highly leveraged in the neighborhood    change in home values for the metropolitan, or non-metropolitan portion of the state    unemployment rate for the county in 2008, and  the change in unemployment in the county between 2007 and 2008.

Though the issue of adding this question to the census largely has been thought of as a partisan one, a deeper investigation reveals there may be consequences for both parties. The map uses data from the Census Bureau’s new Response Outreach Area Mapper (ROAM) and shows predicted mail non-response rates. The darker blue areas depict low mail-in response areas. While these areas tend to be most concentrated in immigrant-dense areas along the West Coast, battleground states like Colorado and Florida as well as states like Mississippi and the Carolinas with difficult-to-reach populations could also be adversely affected.  Undercounts in those areas may lead to loss of congressional seats in states that might otherwise expect to gain seats after 2020 Census. Undercounts also would lead to a loss of funding for states, since many federal programs base funding on population counts.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_04_19_18.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_04_19_18.pdf","April","4","2018","2018-03-30T00:00:00.000"

This month's map shows the year that each city or town would meet its Plan Bay Area 2040 housing growth forecast if it continues on its recent production trajectory, during this lengthy economic expansion. Not surprisingly, most jurisdictions are lagging the Plan’s housing goals – meaning that the region won’t reach its 2040 housing goal until 2072 at the current pace. Notable bright spots for housing production include: Dublin, Pleasanton, and San Ramon in the Tri-Valley; Pittsburg and Brentwood in eastern Contra Costa County; Fairfield in Solano County; and Gilroy and Morgan Hill in southern Santa Clara County. Of the big three cities, San Francisco and San Jose are somewhat behind where they need to be, while Oakland would not reach its 2040 housing goal until 2295 given its pace of development since 2010. Additional analyses on housing trends through 2017 will be publicly released on the Vital Signs performance monitoring website next month.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_5_17_18.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_5_17_18.pdf","May","5","2018","2018-06-14T00:00:00.000"

In this new analysis by the Washington Post, the colors represent voter turnout levels by county for the 2016 presidential election (red is lower turnout, blue is higher).  The analysis shows that there is great variation by state and by county, with turnout in the 2016 election ranging from less than 40 percent of the citizen voting age population in Hawaii to nearly 70 percent in Maine and Minnesota. The variation is even more pronounced at the county level, with turnout in the election ranging from less than 20 percent in some Georgia counties, for instance, to nearly 100 percent in pockets of Arizona, Texas and Colorado. California’s rates follow geography, with turnouts higher along the coast (including the Bay Area), and lower as you move inland and south.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_10_18_18_Letter.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_10_18_18_Letter.pdf","October","10","2018","2018-10-25T00:00:00.000"

The results for the two measures mirror each other, with counties voting “No” on Prop 6 tending to vote “Yes” on Prop 1. Without the Bay Area’s collective 71 percent “No” vote on Proposition 6, voters statewide would have rejected Proposition 6 by only 52 percent instead of 56.5 percent; and without the region’s collective 63 percent “Yes” vote for Proposition 1, that measure would have passed statewide by only 52 percent instead of 55.6 percent.</p> <p><i>These numbers are accurate as of the most recent data available on November 14, 2018, and are not expected to substantially change.</i></p>","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_11_14_18.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_11_14_18.pdf","November","11","2018","2018-11-26T00:00:00.000"

Funding that goes to families within these households has expired or is set to expire by the end of February 2019.  Under the program, rental assistance contracts provide housing aid to seniors or individuals with disabilities with average incomes typically below the federal poverty limit. Due to the shutdown, roughly 1,150 contracts between HUD and private owners of multi-tenant buildings are in limbo across the U.S. Another 500 contracts are set to expire in January, with another 550 contracts to follow in February. According to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, should the shutdown persist into February, an estimated 1,500 Bay Area households could face the real prospect of eviction.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_1_11_19_Shutdown_Renters_Eviction_Letter.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_1_11_19_Shutdown_Renters_Eviction_Letter.pdf","January","1","2019","2019-01-24T00:00:00.000"

America’s white population saw increases between 1790 when the first census was taken until 1960 when the population growth began to decline.

This trio of maps focuses on Pavement Condition Index (PCI), a metric used in determining the structural quality of existing roadway surfaces. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a failed road and 100 representing a brand-new facility. Currently in the nine-county Bay Area region, the 109 jurisdictions (including unincorporated parts of the counties) have an average PCI score of 67, which corresponds to a ""Fair"" condition. Should Proposition 6 pass, the Bay Areaï¿½s average PCI score would fall to 57, which is ""At risk"" of failure. If Proposition 6 fails, SB 1 funds will remain intact thus providing dedicated funding to address significant deferred maintenance in the region's local road network and hold the average PCI score steady at 66 in 2027. Individual jurisdictions may notice a decline in their average PCI score even if Proposition 6 fails. This is because even with the SB 1 funding, a jurisdiction's average PCI score may still worsen over the next decade due to decades of underfunding. However, localities would see a far more precipitous decline in their PCI score -- with far costlier repair implications -- should Proposition 6 pass.","http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_8_20_18.png",,"http://gis.mtc.ca.gov/home/images/motm/motm_8_20_18.pdf","September","9","2018","2018-10-02T00:00:00.000"
