The data presents Quaternary deposits and liquefaction susceptibility for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Region. The nine counties surrounding San Francisco Bay straddle the San Andreas fault system, which exposes the region to serious earthquake hazard (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 1999). Much of the land adjacent to the Bay and the major rivers and streams is underlain by unconsolidated deposits that are particularly vulnerable to earthquake shaking and liquefaction of water-saturated granular sediment.

The data set is not intended to be site-specific. Rather, it depicts the general risk within neighborhoods and the relative risk from community to community. It was developed in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and California Geological Survey (CGS) by determining Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment for Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) for 52,961 points along a grid covering the entire Bay Area, at intervals of 0.05 degrees longitude and 0.05 degrees latitude. PGV was then converted to the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) measure. This analysis incorporates soil conditions which affect the velocity of ground shaking.

Ultramafic rock is chiefly composed of mafic minerals (rich in iron and magnesium), and less than about 45 percent silica, such as olivine, augite, or hypersthene. Pyroxene and serpentinite are ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rock commonly contains chrysotile and amphibole asbestos. Asbestos is a known carcinogen and inhalation of asbestos may result in development of lung cancer or mesothelioma. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has regulated the amount of asbestos in crushed serpentinite used in surfacing applications, such as for gravel on unpaved roads, since 1990. In 1998, new concerns were raised about possible health hazards from activities that disturb rocks and soil containing asbestos and may generate asbestos-laden dust. These concerns recently lead to CARB to revise their asbestos limit for crushed serpentinite and ultramafic rock in surfacing applications from five percent to less than 0.25 percent, and to adopt a new rule requiring best practices dust control measures for activities that disturb rock and soil (construction projects are one example) containing naturally occurring asbestos.","Michael Smith",,"Resiliance Programs; UrbanSim Modeling; Plan Bay Area","geo",,"Plan Bay Area 2040 EIR","United States Geological Survey (USGS)",,"Environment","https://services3.arcgis.com/i2dkYWmb4wHvYPda/arcgis/rest/services/usgs_ultramafic_rock_2009/FeatureServer","Polygon","https://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=155ff3f0b44947c3a59c8497ec398dec#visualize",,"Authoritative",,,"2009","Internal",,,
