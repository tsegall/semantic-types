"EC13A","Economic Output","Regional Performance","The Bay Area economy has grown by 59 percent since the ""dot-com"" bust in 2001.","The Bay Area economy, $900 billion strong, has fared well in the first two decades of the 21st century. Notwithstanding two significant recessions - in 2001-2002 and in 2007-2009 - the region boosted its inflation-adjusted economic output by 59 percent from 2001 to 2017. While a growing population explains some of this growth, the region's economy has still grown by 40 percent since 2001 when evaluated on a per capita basis. Since 2009, the low point of the recent downturn, the region has added $257 billion to its GRP, an average of nearly 5 percent growth each year.","It's worth noting that the Bay Area's impressive growth in output since 2001 has not been accompanied by a proportional growth in overall employment. The number of jobs in the region grew 11 percent over this period, moving from 3.5 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2017. Much of the region's economic growth comes from the job growth in high-productivity sectors such as electronic component manufacturing, computer software design, and scientific research and development services."
"EN2C","Ozone Concentrations","National Context","Despite significant improvements in air quality over the past half-century, Los Angeles still has the highest ozone levels of any major U.S. metro area.","California's stringent motor vehicle emissions standards have played a key role in reducing ozone levels in our state over the past half-century. Although ozone levels vary annually based on weather conditions, Bay Area ozone levels have generally been lower than most major metro areas in recent years. While emissions standards have greatly improved conditions in the City of Angels as well, Los Angeles still has the highest ozone concentrations of any major American metropolis. This is a result of its mountainous terrain, which trap air pollution in the Los Angeles basin. This topography contributes to the creation of smog, but at levels significantly lower than in decades past.",
"EQ2D","Housing Affordability","National Context","Despite having some of the nation's highest housing costs, the Bay Area actually falls in the middle of the pack for affordability, thanks to higher regional incomes.","Despite our very high housing prices, the Bay Area remarkably does not top the list for unaffordability. The region ranks fourth after Los Angeles, Miami and New York. Housing costs are above average in all four of these metro areas, but higher median incomes in the Bay Area mean the average resident here finds it easier to pay the higher housing costs. Meanwhile, Dallas, Atlanta and Washington have the lowest share of excessively-burdened residents among the 10 largest metro areas, led in part by higher incomes in Washington and lower housing costs in the southern metros.",
"EC13B","Economic Output","Local Focus","All Bay Area subregions have seen positive trends for economic output, but Silicon Valley is powering the region's economic surge.","Riding a technology boom, the per capita economic output of Silicon Valley nearly doubled between 2001 and 2017, growing over 40 percent faster than the regional growth rate after adjusting for inflation. While the San Francisco-Oakland subregion still accounts for almost 60 percent of the Bay Area economy, San Jose and other Silicon Valley cities contribute almost 35 percent of our region's economic output.","In the North Bay, Napa, Solano and Sonoma counties account for only 7 percent of the Bay Area's overall economic output. However, on a per capita basis, Napa and Solano counties have experienced economic growth at a rate only slightly lower than that of San Francisco since 2001. Meanwhile, Sonoma County has the smallest long-term growth in per capita GRP since 2001 at 10 percent, due in part to a concentration of jobs in lower-value sectors like agriculture."
"EC13C","Economic Output","National Context","When it comes to economic output, the Bay Area is growing faster than any of its peer metro areas.","The Bay Area's economy has been the nation's best performer since 2001, with its 40 percent per capita GRP growth outpacing other major metro areas by a wide margin. Prior to the Great Recession, our region's economy was also one of the faster-growing in the nation, along with those of Los Angeles, Miami, Washington and New York. Since the Great Recession, however, these other large metro areas have seen little-to-no growth in per capita GRP - while the Bay Area economy has continued its upward trend. Our region's 2017 per capita GRP also topped the list of its big-city peers, outperforming the nation's energy, political and financial hubs (Houston, Washington and New York, respectively) by at least $30,000 per person.",
"EC17A","Airport Activity","Regional Performance","Passenger travel at Bay Area airports has steadily grown over time, primarily at San Francisco International Airport.","Passenger boardings at Bay Area airports have outpaced population growth, increasing nearly 41 percent since 2001 to a total of almost 40 million in 2017. This reflects growing air travel demand from Bay Area residents and increases in passengers arriving in the Bay Area for work, tourism or connecting flights. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) has seen particularly robust growth. With almost 70 percent of our region's total passenger boardings, SFO is clearly the Bay Area's busiest airport, accounting for all net regional passenger growth in the region since 2001. Despite recent investments, passenger levels at both Oakland International Airport (OAK) and San Jose International Airport (SJC) have yet to recover from recession-era airline service cuts to midsize airports.","Sonoma County Airport (STS) in Santa Rosa recorded just 195,000 boardings in 2017, 0.5 percent of the regional total. With terminal expansion underway, the airport has provided a valuable alternative for North Bay residents traveling to select West Coast cities. If regional demand for air travel continues to increase over the coming years, excess capacity in Santa Rosa, Oakland and San Jose may provide relief to SFO, the region's primary passenger hub."
"EC17B","Airport Activity","Local Focus","Bay Area airport freight levels have not fully bounced back from the Great Recession.","Most of the region's domestic air cargo activity occurs at Oakland International Airport (OAK), a regional hub for FedEx. OAK saw a 24 percent drop in air cargo tonnage during the Great Recession, and freight volumes at the airport have remained lower ever since. While tonnage has slowly grown in the last eight years, shifts in the freight industry toward more efficient ground transportation are a challenge for attracting air cargo business, including at OAK.","Other Bay Area airports experienced even steeper reductions than OAK in cargo volumes. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) saw a 40 percent decline and San Jose International Airport (SJC) saw a 50 percent drop in tonnage from 2007 to 2017. SFO and SJC were particularly impacted by shifts in demand that occurred during the Great Recession, and both airports have been slow to fully recover. As an international freight hub, SFO has also endured declining cargo volumes due to shifting trade routes, resulting in goods from Asia bypassing the Bay Area via more direct routing through Alaska."
"EC17C","Airport Activity","National Context","Over the past decade, the strong California economy has spurred substantial growth in boardings at Los Angeles and Bay Area airports.","Most major metro areas across the country have seen growth in passenger boardings in recent years, and the booming California economy has powered substantial growth at airports in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Since 2009, passenger traffic in these two metro areas has grown by over 40 percent each. Los Angeles is now the nation's second-busiest region with around 50 million boardings per year, while in 2017, the Bay Area surpassed Dallas and Miami to become the fifth-busiest region at 40 million boardings per year.",
"EC18A","Seaport Activity","Regional Performance","Cargo activity at the Port of Oakland is at an all-time high.","The Port of Oakland, the region's primary cargo seaport, has seen a gradual increase in the number of containers processed over the past decade, leading to record-high traffic in 2018. While container volumes dipped during the Great Recession and again in 2015 due to a labor dispute, a strong global economy has resulted in slow but steady growth in traffic in recent years.",
"EC18B","Seaport Activity","National Context","The Port of Oakland is one of the nation's largest ports, although it moves significantly less cargo than either Los Angeles-Long Beach and New York-New Jersey.","The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach stand head and shoulders above all competitors when measured by the number of containers moving through the ports. These adjacent ports serve as the nation's primary seaport, benefiting from proximity to major domestic West Coast markets and shorter shipping routes to Asia. On the East Coast, the Port of New York and New Jersey serves as the largest seaport - benefiting from the same advantages as our peers in Southern California. As a result, a large share of goods destined for the Bay Area arrive in Los Angeles and are transported to the Bay Area by truck or by rail.","Since the turn of the 21st century, the Port of Oakland fell from the fifth busiest port in the nation to the eighth. Oakland was surpassed by Savannah, Georgia in 2006, by Hampton Roads, Virginia in 2014, and by Houston in 2017. Lower labor costs combined with proximity to fast-growing markets have resulted in rapid growth at these southern ports."
"EC4C","Unemployment","National Context","Our region's strong economy has resulted in a robust job market with the lowest rate of unemployment among the ten largest U.S. metro areas.","From 2010 to 2018, the Bay Area unemployment rate fell by nearly eight percentage points, the second biggest drop of any major U.S. metro area. The Bay Area currently has the lowest unemployment rate among the ten largest U.S. metro areas. This trend is in line with historical patterns. Over the past 25 years, our region has seen unemployment crest during recessions at levels above the national average, but during periods of economic growth similar to today, the Bay Area's unemployment rate has been among the nation's lowest.","Differences in the unemployment rate across metro regions highlight the key distinctions among local economies. In the Bay Area, low unemployment rates are attributed to the booming tech sector, while in the nation's capital, historically low unemployment rates can be linked with the traditionally stable federal employment sector. Across the country, unemployment rates continue to decline in all major metro areas."
"EC1A","Jobs by Industry","Regional Performance","The Bay Area's job growth over the past quarter-century can be attributed to job creation in the service sector.","Our region has added hundreds of thousands of jobs since 2010, following significant job losses that occurred during the Great Recession. With 3.9 million wage and salary jobs in 2017, the total number of jobs in Bay Area exceeded the previous peak set just a year earlier. Professional and business services, which includes professions like administrative services and management, legal services, scientific research, and computer systems and design, continue to be the largest industry in our region, but other service sector jobs have grown significantly since 1990. This shift towards the service sector reflects an increased demand for education, healthcare, hospitality and information services.","The finance sector has long been one of the pillars of the regional economy, especially in San Francisco. The sector's share of overall regional jobs, however, has declined since 1990. This is perhaps most visible in San Francisco's Financial District, where technology firms are becoming increasingly common in buildings formerly occupied by the financial services companies. Despite San Francisco's history as a global financial center and its prominence as a center of venture capital, the Bay Area does not have a higher share of financial services jobs than the country as a whole. Instead, the professional and business services sector continues to rise in prominence, paralleling growth in high-tech industries."
"EC1B","Jobs by Industry","Regional Distribution","Our region's recent economic expansion has been powered by growth in the technology and service sectors.","Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, job growth has been strongest in industries related to the development and use of technology, from information to professional and business services. This has been accompanied by similarly strong growth in service sectors like education, healthcare, and leisure and hospitality, industries that directly support the growing information and professional and business services industries and cater to an increasingly affluent population.","After decades of declining employment numbers, the manufacturing sector saw modest job growth between 2010 and 2017, adding just under 50,000 new jobs. Manufacturing employment is now at its highest point since 2002. Meanwhile, the construction sector, which experienced the most severe job loss of all sectors during the Great Recession, is also on the upswing. Employment has grown by over 49 percent since 2010 as new building and infrastructure projects increase the demand for work in this sector."
"EC1C","Jobs by Industry","Local Focus","Job growth in the professional and business services sector, which is a fundamental pillar of our region's economy, is increasingly concentrated in San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.","Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Francisco counties have experienced some of the greatest economic benefits from job growth in the professional and business services sector. While the East Bay has also benefitted from service-sector job growth, its most dominant industries are related to manufacturing, government and logistics - sectors that have experienced relatively stagnant job growth over the same time period.","Agriculture remains an important sector in our region, particularly in Sonoma and Napa counties. These two counties account for over half of all farm jobs in the region. While agriculture has declined overall as the region has become more urbanized, these counties have seen a recent resurgence in agricultural employment."
"EC1D","Jobs by Industry","National Context","The Bay Area has the highest share of information and manufacturing jobs among major metro areas nationwide.","It is no surprise that the Bay Area, with its agglomeration of web-related information technology companies, tops the list of metro areas for the largest share of regional jobs in the information sector. New York, home to major media companies, and Los Angeles, home to the film industry, also have relatively large information sectors. The Bay Area is also tied with Chicago for the largest share of manufacturing jobs nationwide, due in part to local increases in manufacturing of specialty products such as food and beverages.","While the Bay Area has a strong concentration of information jobs, other metro areas have their own industry specialization. For example, Washington, D.C., remains highly dependent on government-related industries as reflected in its job share. The data also reflect Houston's focus on resource extraction and both Miami's and Atlanta's emphasis on logistics, even as their economies have become more diverse over time."
"EC3A","Unemployment","Regional Performance","After eight years of economic recovery following the Great Recession, unemployment in the Bay Area is at a thirty-year low.","The Great Recession led to a dramatic spike in unemployment across the country. In the Bay Area, the regional unemployment rate more than doubled, rising from 4.5 percent in 2007 to 10.5 percent in 2010. At the 2010 peak, over 388,000 workers in the Bay Area were unemployed. During the current economic boom, the unemployment rate has declined each year since 2010. The current rate of 2.6 percent is lower than levels experienced during previous economic booms in the late 1990s and mid-2000s.","Of the nine counties in the Bay Area, Solano County had the highest rate of unemployment in 2018, at 3.6 percent. For most years since 1990, Solano County has topped the list of Bay Area counties in relation to unemployment - dipping below the regional average only in 2002 and 2003. Marin and San Mateo counties, by contrast, have fared significantly better, with unemployment rates remaining consistently below the regional average since 1990."
"EC4B","Unemployment","Local Focus","The majority of Bay Area communities have seen unemployment declines of more than five percentage points since 2010.","Oakland, the third most populous city in the region, exemplifies this regional trend. The unemployment rate in Oakland was 3.3 percent in 2018, a 12 percentage point improvement from its peak of 15.4 percent during the height of the Great Recession. This shows improved conditions for the labor force, but it could also be a reflection of rising housing costs and the subsequent displacement of unemployed Oakland residents to more affordable communities.","Overall, a larger share of Bay Area cities is experiencing low unemployment. In 2018, over 75 percent of Bay Area cities had unemployment rates below 3 percent. Our region's lowest unemployment rates can be found in higher-income suburban cities, such as Mill Valley in Marin County, Millbrae and Half Moon Bay in San Mateo County, and Piedmont in Alameda County. Residents of these cities are relatively highly-educated with skills in high demand and therefore tend to experience below-average unemployment rates."
"EC4EC5A","Income","Regional Performance","Median income growth for a typical Bay Area household has been relatively stagnant over time.","Household incomes have risen and fallen in sync with the expansion and contraction of the region's economy over the past four decades. In the last decade, however, incomes have remained remarkably close to an inflation-adjusted average of $93,000 per household, as measured in 2017 dollars.",
"EC4EC5B","Income","Regional Distribution","The gap between rich and poor continues to widen.","While the trend for regional median income seems to indicate stable household incomes over time, a different story is told when examining income trends by percentile. In fact, the income gap between the rich and poor has widened, especially since 1990. From 1970 to 2017, incomes for the poorest households grew only by 12 percent, a pace similar to the regional median. During the same period, the wealthiest households saw a much larger 40 percent growth in inflation-adjusted income.","This trend is most evident in San Francisco, where households at the 60th and 80th percentile have seen incomes grow two to three times faster since 1970 than households at the 20th percentile. In 2017, household income at the 80th percentile in San Francisco exceeded $200,000, while household income at the 20th percentile remained the lowest in the region. This disparity can be attributed in part to the city's affordable housing policy, which has made it possible for some of the lowest-income residents living in subsidized residences to stay. Meanwhile, other low- and middle-income earners without subsidized housing have moved to less expensive parts of the region or beyond."
"EC4EC5C","Income","Local Focus","The region's highest-income households and workers continue to be concentrated in Silicon Valley.","Along with Marin County, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties have the highest household incomes among Bay Area counties. Median household incomes in these counties are above $100,000 - almost $30,000 greater than the region's two lowest-income counties (Solano and Sonoma counties). This holds true at the city level as well. Of the five wealthiest cities in the region, only Belvedere is located outside of Silicon Valley.","Once one of the more affluent counties in the region, Contra Costa County is one of just two Bay Area counties (along with Solano County) to see inflation-adjusted incomes fall between 1970 and 2017. Contra Costa County has seen its share of low- and moderate-income households increase as housing costs in other parts of the region have grown, leading many low- and middle-income households to relocate to the county in search of lower housing costs. After accounting for inflation, the median household income in Contra Costa County today is $5,000 less than it was almost 50 years ago."
"EC4EC5D","Income","National Context","The Bay Area has the second-highest household income levels of any major metro area in the country.","Washington, D.C. is the only major metro area in the country with a higher median household income than the Bay Area. The typical Bay Area household has an income 80 percent higher than a typical household does in Miami, for example - reflecting a significant income gap between the nation's major metro areas.",
"EC7A","Home Prices","Regional Performance","Inflation-adjusted home sale prices now exceed the previous peak, which was set in 2005 at the height of the housing bubble.","The median home price in the Bay Area has risen to $996,000 - an inflation-adjusted 70 percent increase since 2012 - as the region's robust job market and growing population have increased the demand for housing in an already constrained market. Consistently high home prices reflect the region's failure to produce the housing needed over the past half-century. A limited supply of housing and booming demand due to regional job growth continue to send home prices soaring.",
"EC7B","Home Prices","Local Focus","Communities in Solano County and eastern Contra Costa County remain the least expensive options for homebuyers in the region, while those in Silicon Valley and San Francisco remain the highest.","The most affordable housing options in the Bay Area are located in Solano and Contra Costa counties, where the median home price is 30 to 50 percent lower than the regional median. While homes in these areas are often newer and more affordable than the region as a whole, residents may face higher commute costs and longer travel times due to their distance from major job centers. Lower wages can result in homeowners in these locations spending more of their income on housing than in more expensive and affluent parts of the region.","At the other end of the spectrum, median home sales price in select cities in Silicon Valley can be double or triple the regional median. One such example is Palo Alto, where the median home sale price has tripled since 1997 to more than $3 million. The booming economy has also contributed to rising prices in San Francisco, which now has a median home price of $1.3 million."
"EC7C","Home Prices","National Context","The Bay Area remains the most expensive housing market in the United States.","With their mild climates, dynamic economies and constrained housing markets, California's two largest metro areas lead the nation in home prices. In fact, the Bay Area has led the nation, followed by Los Angeles, every single year for the past two decades. Bay Area home prices are approximately double those of New York and Washington metro areas, and triple those of the Miami, Dallas, Philadelphia, Chicago and Atlanta areas. With home prices 55 percent higher than the next most expensive metro area, the Bay Area is truly in a league of its own when it comes to the cost of buying a home.","Since 1997, home prices have increased in all major metropolitan areas across the United States. The fastest growth has been in the Bay Area, which surpassed Los Angeles in 2017. This stands in stark contrast to Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas. A slower-growing regional economy in Chicago and a relatively unconstrained housing supply in both Atlanta and Dallas may be contributing to the slower growth of housing prices in these areas."
"EC8A","Rent Payments","Regional Performance","Inflation-adjusted median rent payments have risen eighteen percent in the Bay Area since 2012.","While the Bay Area traditionally has been one of the nation's most expensive regions, rents have become increasingly high-cost within the last decade. Starting in 2012, inflation-adjusted rents have risen each year to record highs, with the average Bay Area renter household now paying $1,800 per month. One factor contributing to increasingly expensive rents in the region is the inadequate supply of rental housing compared to the demand. Demand has been particularly high in recent years as Millennials enter the rental housing market in unprecedented numbers.",
"EN2B","Ozone Concentrations","Local Focus","Ozone readings vary widely across the region, with inland areas showing the highest levels of this pollutant.","Due to prevailing winds and weather conditions, ozone from motor vehicle emissions and industrial sources in the center of the region accumulates in inland communities. Eastern Contra Costa, eastern Alameda, and southern Santa Clara counties are particularly affected by ozone. Conditions continue to be especially high in Livermore and San Martin, for example. In contrast, the region's second- and third-largest cities, San Francisco and Oakland, had the lowest concentrations of ozone. Given that the majority of the region's population lives in the urban core of the region, this means that ozone exposure is well within the federal standards for most Bay Area residents.",
"EC8B","Rent Payments","Local Focus","Counties that once were affordable have become less so over time, including highly-populated Alameda County.","While high-rent cities have remained expensive, some places previously considered affordable have grown significantly more expensive over time. With rents historically below the regional median, cities in Alameda County have had more affordable rental housing options compared to those in Marin, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, where median rents have been significantly higher since 1970. In the past three years, rent payments in Alameda County have grown by 16 percent, with the fastest growth seen in Union City and Emeryville. This pace is similar to the rapid rent increases seen in Silicon Valley and even faster than rent increases in San Francisco, in part due to that city's rent control policies.","In the North Bay, Sonoma and Solano counties are relatively affordable options for Bay Area renters, at about two-thirds of Silicon Valley median rent payments. Since the Great Recession, median rent payments in Solano County - traditionally the most affordable place for Bay Area renters - have remained stable, as have median rent payments in Sonoma County. Conversely, median rent payments continued to rise in Napa County, including a 45% increase between 2000 and 2017, the highest in the Bay Area over that time period."
"EC8C","Rent Payments","National Context","The Bay Area remains the nation's most expensive major metro area for renters.","The Bay Area has had the highest median rent payments of any major metro area in the United States since data first became available in the 1970s. Moreover, the gap is widening, with median rent payments growing faster in the Bay Area than in any other major metro area over the last half century. High demand for rental housing, limited supply of rental properties and gentrification of historically low-income communities have all contributed to higher rents throughout the region, particularly in the urban core.",
"EC9A","List Rents","Regional Performance","During economic booms, list rents experience rapid growth - only to fall back to median rent payments during subsequent recessions.","For Bay Area renters, increasing housing costs - as evidenced by the continued growth in the region's median rent payment - is a major concern. This rise is even more severe for new renters moving into or within the region. Median list rents, the advertised rental prices for available housing units, have increased four times faster than rent payments since the end of the Great Recession. Compared to rent payments, list rents have been higher and more volatile in the Bay Area because they are more responsive to the region's economic booms and busts and limited supply of new housing. Since the end of the recession, list rents have risen steadily to a median price of over $2,340 and are now on par with inflation-adjusted list rents last seen during the dot-com boom.",
"EC9B","List Rents","Local Focus","During economic booms, list rents increased fastest for housing near the region's major job centers.","The current period of economic growth has resulted in increases in list rents across the Bay Area. Once again, new renters in Silicon Valley and San Francisco have faced rapid price increases. This time, however, Bayside cities in the East Bay such as Oakland, Berkeley and Emeryville have also seen rapid rises in list rents. Oakland has experienced the fastest increase in list rents of all Bay Area cities due to the degree to which job growth shifted towards San Francisco and the preference of the growing workforce for living at the heart of the urban center.","List rents have increased fastest in cities near growing job centers as new workers moving into these cities flood the rental market. During the dot-com boom, list rents in San Francisco, along the Peninsula and in Silicon Valley jumped over 40 percent between 1999 and 2001 in response to rising employment and income before dropping during the subsequent bust. During the same period, list rents in the North Bay and inland portions of the East Bay fluctuated less than 15 percent and have overall been less volatile. List rents in major North Bay cities like Vallejo and Santa Rosa have remained relatively steady during multiple economic cycles."
"EC9C","List Rents","National Context","While list rents were on par with New York and Los Angeles just a few years ago, the Bay Area is now in a league of its own.","Similar to rent payments, median list rents are higher in the Bay Area than any other major metro area in the United States. This makes the Bay Area the most expensive metro for renters to move to. With rapid job growth that has outpaced the number of vacant units on the rental market since 2010, it is not surprising that rents in the Bay Area have increased faster than any other metro area in recent years. The New York metro area, the second most expensive rental market, has also seen significant - albeit smaller - increases in advertised rental prices.",
"EN10A","Bay Restoration","Regional Performance","Rehabilitation of coastal areas has accelerated at unprecedented rates over the past decade.","Since 1969, the surface area of San Francisco Bay has grown by nearly 19,000 acres - a result of policies discouraging bay fill combined with rehabilitation projects that have restored wetlands all across the region. Remarkably, after a century characterized by bay fill, the 21st century has been quite beneficial for the Bay and its surrounding ecosystem with nearly 90 percent of those acres being restored since 2000. In particular, restoration projects in Sonoma County, Marin County and Solano County have played a key role in improving the Bay ecosystem during this time period. In an era of rising tides, these wetland buffers may prove critical in helping the region adapt to global climate change.",
"EN11A","Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise","Regional Performance","Bay Area development patterns are neither increasing nor decreasing the share of regional population at risk from sea level rise.","Depending on the magnitude of sea level rise over the coming decades, between three and six percent of Bay Area residents may be vulnerable to rising tides. While this is just a small share of the region's population, the impacts to these communities may be dramatic, with broader consequences felt beyond these communities' borders from impacts to infrastructure and other regional assets. If sea level rises just 12 inches above today's levels - 194,000 residents will be regularly inundated. Looking at historical growth patterns since 1990, the share of the region's population living in inundated zones has remained relatively steady. This indicates that new housing developments are occurring at the same rate in areas at risk from sea level rise as in the region overall.",
"LU3B","Housing Permits","Regional Distribution","In 2017, fewer than one in five units for which permits were issued could be classified as affordable housing – that is, housing affordable to very low- and low-income households.","14 percent of units for which permits were issued in 2017 will be affordable to very low- or low-income households, well below the 40 percent share of very-low and low-income households currently living in the region. San Francisco and Alameda counties lead the region in affordable housing permits, with each county issuing permits for over 1,000 affordable units in 2017.",
"EN11B","Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise","Local Focus","While no Bay Area county is immune from the threat of rising tides, residential development in Marin, Solano and San Mateo counties are perhaps most vulnerable to inundation.","The unique geographical features of each Bay Area county - combined with the location of existing residential developments - have a strong influence on the number of residents who may be vulnerable to future sea level rise. Residents in Marin County, with much of its population clustered in low-lying areas bordering the Bay shoreline, are the most at risk. Approximately 28 percent of Marin's population is expected to be exposed to inundation by a four-foot rise in tides. Even when sea level rise reaches just 12 inches - a likely forecast for 2050 - almost one in five Marin residents would still be affected. The situation is only slightly better in neighboring Solano County and further south in San Mateo County, with similarly low-lying communities by the Bay such as Vallejo, Redwood City and East Palo Alto.","While existing neighborhoods in San Francisco would not be significantly affected by sea level rise below 2 feet, waterfront communities will be impacted by sea level rise of three feet or more. Approximately 16,500 residents in growing neighborhoods such as Bayview-Hunters Point, Mission Bay and Treasure Island would be affected by a four-foot sea level rise scenario - approximately two percent of the county's current population."
"EN11C","Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise","National Context","Coastal communities across the country that include the Bay Area's San Rafael, New York's Newark and Houston's Galveston are all vulnerable to sea level rise.","With one-foot local sea level rise, the Bay Area has the largest share of population at risk to inundation exposure. However, sea level rise is experienced at different rates across the country. Although the Bay Area is known to experience sea level rise at a higher rate than the global average, local sea levels along the eastern seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico are predicted to rise approximately twice as fast as on the West Coast. At higher sea level rise forecasts, the East Coast metros of Miami, New York and Philadelphia become increasingly vulnerable. Over one million residents in Miami - nearly one-fifth of the population - live in seaside neighborhoods like Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach will be at risk for inundation if sea level rises by 4 feet.","Sea level rise focuses on regular inundation, but each metro also has unique flooding risks. In addition to vulnerability to high sea level rise, Miami is at a great risk of flooding due to groundwater emergence. For the Bay Area, as the sea level rises, the risk of flooding increases for creeks and rivers that flow into the Bay."
"EN1A","Particulate Concentrations","Regional Performance","Particulate matter concentrations declined in 2016 - benefiting from both long-term reductions in emissions and short-term wet weather conditions.","Over the past 15 years, regional 3-year annual average particulate matter concentrations have fallen from 12.3 micrograms (mg) per cubic meter to just 7.8 micrograms per cubic meter - a remarkable improvement in a relatively short time. Peak particulate matter levels also declined significantly over this time period, as indicated by the peak 24-hour average trend. The most recent downward tick in particulate matter levels has been attributable to emission reduction programs as well as favorable weather conditions. An extended period of light winds and no rain contributed to higher levels of particulate matter accumulating in the Bay Area air basin in 2015; the return of wet and windy winter weather conditions in 2016 provided a natural scrubbing that ""washed"" particulate matter from the air.","The Bay Area has made progress in reducing particulate emissions and has reported concentrations below national air quality standards in recent years. However, there is no known safe threshold for exposure to particulate matter. On days when fine particulate matter concentrations spike due to worst-case conditions, Bay Area residents face significant health risks."
"EN1B","Particulate Concentrations","Local Focus","Local particulate matter concentrations are influenced by variations in emissions and local weather conditions.","Although local concentrations in the Bay Area may be higher in close proximity to major emissions sources, particulate levels are relatively similar for different subregions throughout urbanized portions of the Bay Area. Outliers include the areas around West Oakland, San Pablo and Vallejo, where heavy traffic volumes result in above-average particulate matter levels. Areas around Napa also experiences higher particulate matter levels, a result of its high levels of residential wood-burning activity. In contrast, the northern and southern portions of the region near Gilroy and Sebastopol have consistently seen some of the lowest PM2.5Â levels in the urbanized Bay Area.","Over the long term, the Point Reyes monitoring station in Marin County has consistently seen the lowest concentrations of fine particulate matter of any monitoring site in the region. This result is a reflection of the minimal influence of human activity on local air quality at that location due to the relatively pristine conditions within Golden Gate National Recreation Area - generally upwind of population centers and most emission sources."
"EN1C","Particulate Concentrations","National Context","Among major U.S. metro areas, Miami has the cleanest air as a result of low levels of particulates.","Of the ten largest U.S. metro areas, Miami continues to have the lowest particulate levels. Miami's strong performance in terms of regional air quality is a result of multiple favorable factors. Only lightly industrialized, Miami features a flat topography and favorable wind conditions, which mean that emitted particulates tend to be blown away from populated areas. This stands in stark contrast to Los Angeles. There, unfavorable topographical and meteorological conditions result in the highest particulate matter concentrations among the nation's largest metro areas. Meanwhile, the Bay Area falls in the middle of the pack among major metro areas, though with significantly lower particulate matter levels than Southern California.",
"EN2A","Ozone Concentrations","Regional Performance","Even with significant population and economic growth, Bay Area ozone concentrations have declined over the past half-century.","Peak Bay Area ozone concentration levels are well below those first recorded when air quality monitoring began more than 50 years ago. Thanks in part to cleaner cars and trucks, ozone concentrations today are at least one-third lower than 1970s levels. These improved conditions have come about despite growth in population, vehicles and miles traveled in the Bay Area. Since the early 2000s, Bay Area ozone concentrations have consistently been one-third lower than in the 1970s. At the same time, however, ozone concentrations can vary from year to year depending on weather conditions. In the last two years, the weather was unfavorable and as a result concentrations in the region's worst affected locations ticked upward. Based on these recent data, the Bay Area exceeds the new, more stringent federal standards for ozone.",
"EN3A","Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Regional Performance","On a per-capita basis, greenhouse gas emissions from primary sources have declined by six percentage points since 2010.","While the Bay Area economy has surged in recent years, greenhouse gas emissions have not. Remarkably, since 2010, per-capita greenhouse gas emissions have declined by six percentage points. This trend is primarily attributable to decreased consumption of electricity and natural gas and expanded availability of renewable power sources like solar and wind. At the same time, per-capita consumption of gasoline and diesel fuels by Bay Area drivers has declined in the last few years as well - albeit at a slower rate than the electricity and natural gas sectors. These positive trends have occurred even as economic output has surged by 22 percent and jobs have grown by 18 percent over this five-year period. Still, to achieve our region's increasingly ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, more progress will be necessary in the coming years.",
"EN3B","Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Local Focus","Due to a combination of robust public transit services and cleaner industries, San Francisco has the lowest per-capita greenhouse gas emissions of any Bay Area county.","In 2015, combustion of fuels in cars and trucks - combined with consumption of natural gas and electricity - resulted in nearly 50 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions - but not every county contributes equally to this regional total. Most notably, per-capita greenhouse gas emissions from primary sources in San Francisco are only 61 percent of regional average. The city's ""green"" status is likely attributable to relatively clean industries, a knowledge-based economy, a robust public transit system, limited parking and a dense land use pattern. Alameda County ranks second-lowest for per-capita emissions, with similarly ""green"" characteristics in more established communities like Berkeley and Oakland.","Contra Costa and Solano counties are notable outliers in terms of their above-average per-capita greenhouse gas emissions. In large part, this is due to the presence of oil refineries and other heavy industries in both counties, which consume large quantities of natural gas for their industrial processes. With regards to the transportation sector by itself, Solano and Napa counties top the list in terms of per-capita greenhouse gas emissions, most likely due to longer trip distances and limited public transit options."
"EN4A","Fatalities from Crashes","Regional Performance","Fatalities from crashes has ticked upwards since 2010, reversing much of the decline seen during the Great Recession.","Annual fatalities from crashes have grown since 2010 - likely a result of increased road activity as our region's economy has boomed. The past six years mark the first period of sustained growth in road fatalities since the late 1970s, when there were similar conditions during a period of economic growth. Despite the recent adverse trend in fatalities, Bay Area roads are still significantly safer than they in the 1970s and 1980s. This reflects the benefits of improved vehicle safety technologies such as airbags. The long-term decline in fatalities has occurred even as the region's population and mileage traveled has grown.","Although roads have become increasingly safe for motorists, over one-third of all 2016 traffic fatalities in the Bay Area were vulnerable road users - bicyclists and pedestrians. While improved vehicle safety technologies have managed to reduce fatalities among vehicle occupants, non-motorized travelers since 2011 have experienced higher fatality levels than in decades past."
"EN4B","Fatalities from Crashes","Local Focus","San Francisco stands out as an outlier - with one of the lowest fatality rates per capita but one of the highest fatality rates per mile driven.","While Solano, Napa and Sonoma counties unfortunately have had the region's highest fatality rates on both a per-capita and per-mile basis, fatality rate statistics in San Francisco County are more complicated. On a per-capita basis, San Francisco had the lowest fatality rate of any county in the region in 2016. This reflects the shorter travel distances and slower speeds in the city compared with much of the region. At the same time, per mile driven, San Francisco ranked near the top of the 2016 list for having the most dangerous roads in the region - reflecting San Francisco's distinctive modal split. Motorists account for the majority of fatalities regionwide, whereas in San Francisco pedestrians and bicyclists account for the majority of fatalities.",
"EN4C","Fatalities from Crashes","National Context","In contrast to the Bay Area's relatively safe roads, Sunbelt metro areas top the list for highest fatality rates.","Atlanta, Miami, Houston and Dallas top the list of major U.S. metro areas with the highest fatality rates per resident. These metro areas have double the fatality rate of the safest major metro area - New York. The stark difference between the Sunbelt metros and the nation's most transit-oriented metro is reflective of the former group's higher travel speeds, greater miles traveled, and higher auto mode share. The Bay Area, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles rank favorably just behind New York for the safest roads among major metro areas, each with just under six traffic fatalities per 100,000 residents in 2015.",
"EN7A","Injuries from Crashes","Regional Performance","More people were injured on Bay Area roadways in 2016 than in any year since 2001.","In 2016, nearly six people were seriously injured in a crash every single day in the Bay Area - an indication that more work remains to be done to make sure motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists can all get to their destinations safely. Over the past decade, although motorists continue to account for the majority of serious traffic injuries, the annual number of non-motorized injuries increased 28 percent. The top 3 primary collision factors for crashes that resulted in injuries are unsafe speed, improper turning, and driving under the influence.",
"EN7B","Injuries from Crashes","Local Focus","The rate of injuries resulting from collisions varies greatly by county.","Nearly 40 percent of the region's serious injuries occur in Alameda and Santa Clara counties, which is perhaps not surprising given these counties' large populations and high vehicle-mileage traveled. However, in urban San Francisco - where bicyclists and pedestrians accounted for over half of the serious injuries - the per-VMT injury rate was highest in the region. The North Bay counties of Napa and Sonoma also have above-average injuries per-VMT due to more miles of rural roads, which have higher crash rates.",
"LU3C","Housing Permits","Local Focus","Oakland doubled the number of units for which it issued permits from 2016 to 2017, the largest increase of any Bay Area city.","Oakland historically has lagged behind its “Big Three” peers, San Francisco and San Jose, when it comes to permitting rates, issuing 20 to 25 percent as many permits as San Jose or San Francisco between 2010 and 2016. In 2017, Oakland issued permits for over 4,200 units, double the number of units that were permitted in the previous year. Meanwhile, San Francisco continued to lead the region in permitting rates, issuing permits for over 4,500 units in 2017.",
"EQ1A","Jobs by Wage Level","Regional Performance","The Bay Area's workforce has become more skewed towards high- and low-wage jobs over the years.","In 2017, jobs in middle-wage occupations represented one-fifth of our region's employment, having declined in both relative and absolute terms since 2001. Diminishing middle-wage employment has meant increased job polarization, leaving low-wage workers fewer options for upward mobility. Many of the middle-wage jobs lost have been in occupations specific to manufacturing. Meanwhile, the number of middle-wage jobs in the healthcare sector, such as laboratory technicians and dental assistants, has seen sustained growth. Middle-wage employment in the construction sector has also recovered from its Great Recession downturn.","While high-wage jobs represent the majority of all jobs in the Bay Area, both the absolute number and share of workers employed in low-wage jobs has been on the rise in recent years. From 2016 to 2017, the region added roughly 90,000 low-wage jobs and 9,000 middle-wage jobs, while the number of high-wage jobs decreased by around 12,000. The growth in low-wage jobs has been predominantly in the retail and food service sectors."
"EQ1B","Jobs by Wage Level","Local Focus","High-wage jobs are increasingly concentrated in Silicon Valley and San Francisco.","The change in jobs across wage levels has not been evenly spread across the Bay Area. A disproportionate share of high-wage jobs were created in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, the epicenters of recent economic growth. To a lesser extent, this trend also has been seen in the East Bay, where the gap between the share of low-wage and high-wage jobs has narrowed since 2001. While each of these subregions has seen gains in high-wage technology jobs, job growth in the East Bay has been more pronounced in education and health service occupations.","Low-wage occupations, such as janitors or retail salespeople, are not as prone to geographic clustering as middle- and high-wage work. As a result, the distribution of low-wage jobs largely has been proportionate to total employment. Yet contrary to the regional trend, the North Bay has seen its share of low-wage jobs grow, powered by growth in occupations like personal care aides and food service workers."
"EQ1C","Jobs by Wage Level","National Context","Washington, New York and the Bay Area have the most uneven distribution of jobs by wage level.","In 2017, middle-wage jobs represented roughly one-fifth of all jobs in Washington, New York and the Bay Area, making their shares of middle-wage jobs smallest among the large metro areas. An increasingly high median wage for the Bay Area has resulted in traditionally middle-wage occupations like medical assistants and office clerks being classified as low-wage. As a result, the Bay Area's share of low-wage workers is nearly 40 percent, the highest of any of its peer metro areas.","While all peer metro areas have larger shares of low- and high-wage jobs than middle-wage jobs, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas and Houston have more even distributions of jobs by wage level. Miami and Atlanta's large service sector workforce means its median wage is relatively low, and therefore many consumer service occupations are classified as middle-wage. In Texas metros, the oil and gas industry has created jobs in related middle-wage occupations, such as technicians and transportation operators."
"EQ2A","Housing Affordability","Regional Performance","Many Bay Area households struggle with the cost of housing, with renters often bearing the largest burden.","The share of Bay Area households excessively burdened by housing costs has increased since 1980, with home prices and rents alike growing at a faster rate than incomes. In 2017, nearly one in three Bay Area households spent at least 35 percent of its income on housing. Though housing affordability has been improving for both renters and homeowners since the Great Recession, the improvement has been more dramatic for homeowners. Since 2009, the share of excessively burdened renters decreased by just one percent, while the share of excessively burdened homeowners fell by 10 percent.","Bay Area homeowners have benefited from a number of trends in recent years. The housing bust, combined with high foreclosure rates, allowed many of today's owners to buy homes in a period of relatively low prices. Low interest rates also reduced the cost of owning for existing and new homeowners at the same time that income growth accelerated for higher-earning households. Coupled with slow-growing property tax rates, the result has been improved housing affordability for owners. Renters, many of whom have been priced out of the home-buying market by comparatively lower incomes and tighter lending standards, have seen little relief from rising rents and stagnant wages."
"EQ2B","Housing Affordability","Regional Distribution","Low- and moderate-income households are heavily burdened by the region's housing market.","The vast majority of low-income Bay Area households experience an excessive housing cost burden, regardless of where they live. Increasingly, even moderate-income households face excessive cost burdens. For example, nearly 45 percent of Bay Area households earning $50,000 to $75,000 per year spent more than 35 percent of their income on housing in 2017. Only once a household's annual income exceeds $100,000 does the region become marginally more affordable. Just six percent of these high-income households are considered excessively burdened, with more than half of the Bay Area's high-income households spend less than one-fifth of their annual income on housing.",
"EQ2C","Housing Affordability","Local Focus","While affordability has worsened throughout the Bay Area, the greatest changes have occurred in the North Bay.","27 percent of San Francisco households are considered excessively burdened, bringing the share within one percentage point of the lowest on record for the city. Unlike the rest of the region, this trend has been powered by increases in affordability for renters. In fact, San Francisco reported the lowest share of excessively-burdened renter households on record in 2017. This is due largely to higher-income households flocking to San Francisco in recent years, and excessively-burdened lower-income renters filtering out. While rent control has kept housing affordable for existing residents in San Francisco, it has managed only to slow the trend.","Solano, Sonoma and Marin counties all have seen their shares of excessively-burdened households grow faster than the regional average. Despite home prices and rents that generally are much lower than those in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, lower median incomes mean that households in these counties typically experience more acute affordability challenges. This is due in part to the rising share of renter households in these areas, a group more vulnerable to rising housing costs given fluctuating rents. Existing residents also face growing competition from residents of pricier bayside cities seeking more affordable housing options, while slow housing production has failed to meet this increased demand."
"EQ3A","Displacement Risk","Regional Performance","While relatively stable in recent years, regional displacement risk has increased substantially since 1990.","Displacement has become a serious regional concern over the past few decades. As recently as 1990, San Francisco was the only Bay Area county with more than 30 percent of its lower-income residents at risk. By 2017, every county had displacement risk levels in this range. Displacement risk is rising not only in increasingly expensive bayside communities, but also in the counties of the North Bay. Once seemingly immune to displacement risk, these counties are now being affected by spillover demand for housing.","The Great Recession coincided with a bump in displacement risk in most Bay Area counties, as low-income homeowners bore the brunt of the negative effects of the mortgage lending crisis. However, in the region's most jobs-dense counties - San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara - the share of lower-income households at risk of displacement actually fell during the Great Recession, as demand for housing subsided and rising housing costs stabilized."
"EQ3B","Displacement Risk","Local Focus","Neighborhoods at risk of displacement range from urban neighborhoods like San Francisco's Mission District and West Berkeley to suburban communities like East San Mateo and Concord.","Displacement risk has become a regional issue in recent years, through a combination of rising housing prices, scarce affordable housing production, and limited tenant protections in many cities. While urban neighborhoods have long been at risk of displacement via gentrification, the problem can be just as acute in suburban communities such as Concord, El Cerrito, Santa Clara and Santa Rosa. Not surprisingly, cities known for providing affordable options to those displaced - such as Antioch and Vallejo - have relatively few neighborhoods considered at risk, even as they experience rising poverty.",
"EQ3C","Displacement Risk","National Context","Fast-growing Texas metros have the lowest displacement risk.","Houston and Dallas have the lowest and second-lowest levels of displacement risk, respectively, among major U.S. metro areas. This speaks not only to their relative affordability - which reduces pressure on lower-income households - but also to the lack of gentrification in these metro areas' traditional lower-income communities. In contrast to metropolitan areas like Philadelphia, Washington or Los Angeles, Texas metro areas have maintained a 20thÂ century-style pattern of outward development, which has resulted in many higher-income earners continuing to prefer locations at the periphery. In contrast, the metro areas with the highest risk of displacement have seen a much greater shift in homebuyer preferences, resulting in more gentrification and heightened pressure for displacement in renewed walkable urban cores.",
"EQ4A","Migration","Regional Performance","Economic recovery has markedly slowed the rate of out-migration from the Bay Area.","While the high cost of housing remains a major hurdle for the Bay Area, the strong job market has significantly reduced the net flow of residents moving to other states. In 2011, 15,800 more Bay Area residents moved to other states than moved into our region. By 2015, this trend had reversed, with around 3,000 more people moving from other states to the Bay Area than leaving for other states. In this same four-year period, relocation from the Bay Area to more affordable counties to the east remained relatively stable. Net migration between the Bay Area and these communities indicates a net outflow of 14,500 residents in 2015, resulting in lengthy commutes for those that continue to work in the Bay Area.","While data on the number of Bay Area residents that leave the region for other countries is not available, data on immigration show that roughly 86,000 people moved to the Bay Area from abroad in 2015. The majority of these new arrivals hail from Asia, though the fastest growing contingent is residents from other North American countries."
"EQ4B","Migration","Local Focus","The East Bay continues to be a more affordable option for Bay Area households seeking to remain close to major job centers.","While many people have moved outside the Bay Area in pursuit of lower-cost housing, relocation within our region is even more common. In 2015, there was a net flow of 14,800 people from the three counties closest to booming job centers - San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara - to the more affordable counties of the East Bay. Even within the East Bay, residents continue to relocate from Alameda County to lower-cost Contra Costa County, or north to Solano County.","Those moving out of the Bay Area often choose the closest county beyond the borders of the nine-county region. New arrivals to San Joaquin County are disproportionately from Alameda and Contra Costa counties, whereas residents relocating to locations like Los Banos in the Central Valley and Hollister in the Central Coast region often come from Santa Clara County. Intra-state migration into the Bay Area appears to be driven by proximity to high-wage job centers, with the lion's share of former Southern Californians choosing San Francisco, Alameda and Santa Clara counties as their new homes."
"EQ4C","Migration","National Context","Economic opportunity remains a powerful driver for migration within the United States.","Before accounting for immigration, only three of the ten most populous U.S. metro areas - Atlanta, Dallas and Houston - experienced net in-migration in 2015. These low-cost, jobs-rich metro areas are attracting new residents from across the country. At the same time, the Bay Area's slight loss of residents remains a fraction of the out-migration flows from Chicago and New York. While some former New Yorkers and Chicagoans are merely relocating to warmer climates - such as the tens of thousands who annually relocate from New York to Florida - others are looking for better job opportunities and lower-cost housing.","Immigration from other countries remains critical to the ongoing vitality of metropolitan areas across the United States. While New York and Los Angeles unsurprisingly attract the largest number of immigrants each year (given their substantial existing immigrant populations), the Bay Area and Miami rank third and fourth, respectively, for immigration. Economic opportunity, geographic proximity and the existence of established immigrant communities are critical drivers for immigration as well; over half of all Bay Area immigrants come from Asia and over two-thirds of all Miami immigrants relocate from countries in Latin America."
"LU3D","Housing Permits","National Context","Even with a strong economy and steady population growth, the Bay Area continues to issue permits for housing at a slower rate than Sunbelt metros.","While the Bay Area issued more permits per capita than its peers in large metros in the Northeast, the region continued to fall short of permitting rates seen in Sunbelt metros like Dallas and Atlanta. Metro areas across the southern United States issued two to three times as many permits per capita as the Bay Area in 2017, the majority of which are permits for single-family homes. In contrast, the Bay Area ranked second in terms of the share of permits issued for multi-family housing, falling just short of the New York metro area.",
"EQ5A","Poverty","Regional Performance","Our region's poverty rate is at a historic low.","The Great Recession brought poverty levels to new highs, peaking at 27 percent in 2012. Since then, the Bay Area's poverty rate has fallen year after year. In 2017, the poverty rate fell below 20 percent for the first time on record. While this is promising news, 1.5 million Bay Area residents still live in poverty, highlighting the continued importance of affordable housing and job training opportunities for all Bay Area residents.","Poverty rates have fallen in all Bay Area counties except Contra Costa and Marin. The reduction in poverty rates has been especially pronounced in San Francisco and Alameda counties, falling 5 percent since 1980 in Alameda County and 12 percent in San Francisco over the same time period. An influx of high-earning households moving to centrally-located cities like San Francisco and Oakland, coupled with rising housing costs that have prompted many low-income households to relocate to lower-cost communities, have largely powered this trend."
"EQ5B","Poverty","Local Focus","Poverty in the Bay Area increasingly is concentrated in inland cities, though pockets of poverty remain in bayside neighborhoods.","The suburbanization of poverty is readily apparent in communities like Antioch, Oakley, Rohnert Park and San Leandro, each of which has seen more than a 10 percentage point increase in its poverty rate since 2000. In contrast, 2017 poverty rates in San Francisco and San Jose were well below the levels seen in 2000. This trend is driven in part by the relative affordability of housing in these suburban cities, especially as housing costs have risen dramatically in gentrifying urban neighborhoods. Bay Area workers in poverty living in inland suburbs often face restricted economic opportunities due to excessive commute lengths and limited transportation options.","While the Bay Area has experienced increased poverty in inland cities, select neighborhoods close to the Bay also continue to experience high poverty rates. In San Mateo County, some neighborhoods in East Palo Alto and Redwood City have poverty rates over 50 percent, more than triple the county rate. Similarly, the East Bay cities of Oakland, Richmond and San Pablo all have neighborhoods in which the majority of residents are in poverty."
"EQ5C","Poverty","National Context","Southern metros have the greatest challenges with regional poverty.","At just under 20 percent, the Bay Area ranks second-to-last among the top 10 most populous U.S. metro areas for its share of residents in households with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty limit. Despite this relatively strong performance, our region's high cost of living presents significant challenges for low-income residents. Yet at the same time, other regions have much greater poverty challenges. Poverty rates are highest in the South, with Miami, Houston, Atlanta and Dallas comprising four of the five metros with the highest poverty rates. While the cost of living is substantially lower in Southern metro areas, evidently incomes have not kept pace for many households.",
"EQ6A","Life Expectancy","Regional Performance","Life expectancy in the region has increased, indicating the Bay Area's population is getting healthier.","Life expectancy in the Bay Area was over 82 years as of 2013, a six year improvement compared to 1990. Regional life expectancy increased almost every year on record since 1990. The most recent year to see a drop was 2005, around the time of a particularly severe flu season. Prior to that, life expectancy dipped in 1993 around the height the AIDS epidemic. Significant healthcare improvements for people living with HIV in the late 1990s had a substantial impact on health outcomes, particularly in San Francisco County where life expectancy jumped nearly six years between 1990 and 2000.","While San Francisco County saw exceptional improvement in life expectancy after 1990, the other eight Bay Area counties also saw life expectancy increases. There are, however, widening disparities between counties as life expectancy is increasing more slowly in Solano compared to the rest of the region in recent years. In 2000, the gap in life expectancy between Solano County and the regional average was 1.5 years. By 2013, that number had grown to 3.8 years."
"EQ6B","Life Expectancy","Local Focus","Life expectancies across different Bay Area ZIP Codes varied by as much as 13 years.","Life expectancy within different Bay Area ZIP Codes ranged from a low of 73 years to a high of 86 years. Life expectancy in ZIP Codes representing neighborhoods in the Berkeley Hills in the East Bay and around Los Altos Hills in the South Bay have some of the best health outcomes in the region. Meanwhile, ZIP Codes in Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, urban neighborhoods areas in Solano County, and Bayside neighborhoods in the East Bay have relatively lower life expectancies.","The lowest life expectancies in the region were in the Downtown and Tenderloin areas of San Francisco. Life expectancies in neighboring Eureka Valley were 10 years higher. Similarly, life expectancy in East Oakland is 75 years compared to 85 years in the Oakland Hills. San Francisco and Oakland exemplify some of the significant health inequities that exist in the Bay Area."
"LU1A","Population","Regional Performance","The South Bay has risen to prominence as the region's largest population center.","The most significant change by far to our region’s population pattern over the past 50 years has been the rise of the South Bay. Santa Clara County is now home to 25 percent of Bay Area residents, compared to 18 percent in 1960. In this same period, the City of San Jose saw its population skyrocket from 200,000 people to more than 1 million, a surge that allowed this unofficial capital of Silicon Valley to claim the title of the region’s most populous city from San Francisco. Meanwhile, in the North Bay, Marin County was eclipsed by both Solano County and Sonoma County in the late 1970s.","The City and County of San Francisco was the second most populous Bay Area county in 1960, home to 20 percent of the region’s residents. In the following decades, San Francisco was surpassed in population by Santa Clara and Contra Costa counties during a period of urban disinvestment and widespread suburban development. Since the turn of the 21st century, the declining share of the population living in San Francisco has stabilized at 11 percent, as population and employment growth have returned to historical urban strongholds."
"LU4A","Housing Production","Regional Performance","While housing construction is up from the depths of the Great Recession, the 2018 production rate is still well below that of past decades.","Demand for housing in the Bay Area has continued to grow due to high rates of job creation and ensuing population growth. Historically, the region has not produced the housing needed over the past half-century to keep up with demand, resulting in higher housing costs due to the constrained supply. In 2018, the Bay Area added just 15,400 housing units, a fraction of the peaks seen in the 1990s.","Multi-family home construction has driven growth since 2010, with 135,000 new multi-family units built between 2010 and 2018 – 73 percent of the total produced. In 2018, there was a roughly 50-50 split between single-family and multi-family production. This is due in large part to substantially lower multi-family housing production rates in San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, which produced 2,000 and 3,700 fewer multi-family units, respectively, in 2018 than in 2017."
"LU1B","Population","Regional Distribution","Over the past decade, the distribution of Bay Area residents between center cities and suburban communities has stabilized.","The Bay Area of 1960 is starkly different than the Bay Area of 2018, especially in terms of where people live. Up until 1960, growth was somewhat concentrated in the ring of cities close to San Francisco Bay. Since 1960, the share of residents living in inland, delta and coastal cities farther from the Bay increased from 12 percent in 1970 to 25 percent in 2018. Much of this growth occurred in Contra Costa, Alameda, Sonoma and Solano counties, where there was ample land to develop new neighborhoods and opportunities to annex adjacent unincorporated areas. Since 2007, the proportion of residents in inland areas has remained constant, reflecting an overall slowdown in the rate of population growth for these areas compared to historical norms, combined with accelerated population growth in select Bayside and all “Big Three” cities.","Vital Signs categorizes these geographical jurisdictions based on their proximity to the Bay, with the three largest cities – San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland – grouped separately as the “Big Three.” Cities that ring the Bay are referred to as “Bayside” cities, while the cities beyond this core are classified descriptively as “Inland, Delta and Coastal.” The remainder of Bay Area lands – by far the largest segment in terms of acreage – is classified as “Unincorporated.”"
"LU1C","Population","Local Focus","Some Priority Development Areas are already rapidly developing, while others have seen limited growth in recent decades.","Examining neighborhoods now identified as Priority Development Areas (PDAs), locally designated areas with frequent transit service, reveals historical population trends and allows us to track where growth is occurring. Transit-Oriented Development, or “TOD”, Corridors, especially those in Santa Clara County and Oakland, have seen the largest growth in overall population in the past decade. Other PDAs have seen robust relative population growth, especially in communities such as San Francisco’s Treasure Island & Yerba Buena Island, Mountain View’s North Bayshore, and Newark’s Dumbarton TOD, which started with smaller populations. Other PDAs have seen more limited growth – including locations like Central Rohnert Park and Berryessa in San Jose – but will likely see future growth in decades to come due to regional transit connections like SMART and BART.",
"LU1D","Population","National Context","While recent population growth may seem rapid to residents, our region’s rate of growth nonetheless remains significantly slower than other booming metro areas.","The Bay Area has been the nation’s fourth-largest metropolitan area by population since the early 1980s, though Sunbelt metros like Houston, Dallas, Atlanta and Miami have added population at faster rates. Since 2010, population growth in Houston and Dallas has occurred at twice the rate of the Bay Area – even as our region’s robust economy has produced jobs at a faster clip. With only 200,000 fewer residents than the Bay Area in 2018, Dallas may surpass the Bay Area in population within the next decade.",
"LU2A","Jobs","Regional Performance","Employment is at an all-time record high.","The Bay Area economy has experienced and survived two bubbles in the 21st century – the “dot-com” technology bubble of the early 2000s and the more recent, real estate-based financial crisis of 2008. Since the end of the Great Recession, the region’s job market has recovered and continued to grow. Jobs have grown by at least 3 percent each year since 2012, reaching a new peak of over 4 million jobs in 2018. Only time will tell whether these trends are fleeting or the new normal.","Between 2000 and 2010, the number of jobs in San Francisco decreased by 65,000. In recent years, the city has more than recovered, adding 184,000 jobs between 2010 and 2018 – nearly three times the number lost in the first decade of the 21st century. Santa Clara County is also experiencing an unprecedented boom, adding over 250,000 jobs in this decade after losing 180,000 jobs between 2000 and 2010. Together, these two counties account for nearly half the region’s employment – and more than 60 percent of regional job growth since 2010. In contrast, recent job growth in the North Bay counties of Solano and Marin – as well as Contra Costa County – has been significantly less robust."
"LU2B","Jobs","Local Focus","Jobs are clustered around San Francisco Bay, particularly in Silicon Valley and San Francisco.","The location of employment clusters can have a strong effect on transportation patterns and housing costs. When divided into 20 sub-counties, the largest job centers continue to be San Francisco, North Santa Clara County and San Jose.  Together, these sub-counties totaled more than 1.6 million jobs in 2018 – nearly half of all regional employment. Along with Central and South San Mateo County, these sub-county areas have seen the most robust job growth rates since 2010. However, booming job markets in these sub-county areas also have contributed to a growing regional housing and jobs imbalance.","While established East Bay communities have seen some job growth in recent years, it has not been to the same level as their San Francisco and Silicon Valley counterparts. East Alameda County, which experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, has seen the most growth among East Bay sub-county areas, totaling a 26 percent increase since 2010. On the other side of the hills, North Alameda County – the region’s fourth-largest job center that includes downtown Oakland and downtown Berkeley – has seen a 6 percent increase. The diverse geography of job growth across the Bay Area continues to transform the region’s housing and transportation patterns, with East Bay residents increasingly commuting to faster-growing job centers in Silicon Valley and San Francisco."
"LU2C","Jobs","National Context","Since 2010, Bay Area employment has grown faster than any other major metro area.","Over the past 25 years, Dallas and Houston have seen the fastest job growth among the 10 major U.S. metro areas, while the Bay Area has remained in the middle. With expanding manufacturing sectors, rapidly increasing population and housing production rates that can match pace with growing demand, it is no surprise that these Texas metros lead the nation. However, when looking at job growth since 2010, the Bay Area leads the nation, due in large part  to renewed growth in tech sector employment.",
"LU3A","Housing Permits","Regional Performance","Despite a significant increase since the Great Recession, permitting still remains well below mid-20th century levels.","Bay Area cities and counties issued permits for 27,000 housing units in 2017. While thousands of units below the peaks of the 1970s and 1980s, this represents the largest number of units permitted in the post-Great Recession era. Multi-family housing accounted for more than 75 percent of all permits issued in 2017, one of the highest shares on record. In highly urbanized counties like San Francisco and Santa Clara, the share is even higher, with permits for multi-family units accounting for 98 percent and 88 percent of all permits, respectively. Meanwhile, counties in the North Bay continue to issue more permits for single-family units than multi-family units.",
"LU4B","Housing Production","Local Focus","Since the end of the Great Recession, the majority of the region's housing production has been multi-family properties in San Francisco and San Jose.","San Jose and San Francisco, the two largest cities in the region, have produced around one-third of all new Bay Area housing units since 2010. Fueled by growing demand for rental housing near job centers, San Jose and San Francisco have added nearly 45,000 units to the region’s housing stock – over 90 percent of which are multi-family units. However, housing production in 2018 was down 29% in San Jose and 50% in San Francisco from 2017, which could indicate a slowdown in the demand for housing in these areas. Cities in Alameda County like Oakland, Pleasanton and Union City, and cities in Silicon Valley like Redwood City, Foster City and Sunnyvale also have produced a large share of multi-family units.","Natural disasters have definitively shaped the state of housing production at the local level. The 2017 Northern California wildfires affected communities throughout the North Bay, and the housing production for our region is still recovering from the loss of nearly 5,000 homes. Santa Rosa, as well as unincorporated Sonoma and Napa Counties, were particularly hard hit. However, housing production in these areas was up 8% in 2018, with Sonoma County alone adding 1,400 units."
"LU4C","Housing Production","National Context","The major metros in the South have produced housing at rates two and three times faster than their peers.","Dallas, Houston and Atlanta continue to produce the most housing units per capita among the major metros. The Texas metros have been national leaders in housing production for nearly a decade, with per capita production rates well above that of our region. Dallas is approaching three times the housing units per capita of the Bay Area, while Houston is approaching two times. While housing production in Atlanta fell precipitously during the Great Recession, it has rebounded in recent years to nearly match that of Houston. Housing production in these areas can be attributed to lower construction costs, simpler permitting processes, and skyrocketing job and population growth. In 2017, these three southern metros continued to produce more housing units than the other seven major metros combined.","The Bay Area is ranked 5th among the major metros for per capita housing production, with New York, Chicago and Philadelphia continuing to produce the lowest number of new housing units per capita. However, 2018 was the first year that Chicago outpaced Philadelphia in per capita housing production, suggesting a reversal of the slow growth trend the metro area has experienced for decades."
"LU5A","Greenfield Development","Regional Performance","The pace of Bay Area greenfield development slowed by nearly a third from 2000 to 2016.","Between 2000 and 2010, the Bay Area’s urban footprint expanded by around 4,700 acres per year. In this decade, that figure has been cut in half, down to 2,000 acres per year. The latest data show greenfield development on the rise from 2014 to 2016, which could suggest a resurgence in demand for lower-cost housing in less-centrally located parts of the region.","Development across the Bay Area increased the size of the region’s developed footprint to approximately 790,200 acres in 2016, making it 17 percent larger than the footprint of 1990. Since 1990, greenfield development was most rapid between 1990 and 2000, when approximately 55,000 acres were added to the region’s developed area. Nevertheless, the Bay Area has grown denser over time, with the rate of population growth outpacing the rate of greenfield development since 1990."
"LU5B","Greenfield Development","Regional Distribution","Regional greenfield development since 2010 has been concentrated in Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties.","East Bay counties, along with Santa Clara County to the south, have accounted for nearly two-thirds of the Bay Area’s greenfield development since 2010. Development in these three counties largely has consisted of nonagricultural land converting to housing or retail. Meanwhile, Sonoma County has drastically reduced its share of greenfield development in this decade, accounting for just 5 percent of the region’s share since 2010 – down from 19 percent in the 1990s.",
"LU5C","Greenfield Development","Local Focus","The Bay Area’s urban footprint grew in large part due to activity in eastern Contra Costa and southern Santa Clara counties.","Powered in part by significant development activity in Brentwood, Antioch and Oakley, a significant chunk of our region’s greenfield development from 1990 to 2016 occurred in eastern Contra Costa County. The 28,100 acres of greenfield development in the county represented 25 percent of all such development within the region during this period. Combined with similar activity around South San Jose, Gilroy and Morgan Hill, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties together account for more than 40 percent of our region’s greenfield development in this 26-year timeframe.","Sonoma and Solano counties have accounted for the majority of greenfield development in the North Bay. In Sonoma County – where nearly 16,600 acres have been developed since 1990 – nearly all development can be attributed to the conversion of small parcels in unincorporated areas along the U.S. Route 101 corridor. This contrasts with the development pattern in Solano County, where new, multi-acre residential subdivision developments are much more common."
"LU5D","Greenfield Development","National Context","Since 2000, the Bay Area has consumed the fewest greenfield acres among the 10 largest U.S. metro areas.","While the fast-growing Sunbelt metropolitan regions of Atlanta, Dallas and Houston absorbed land at a prodigious pace from 2000 through 2018 – with each expanding its urban footprint by around 40 percent – the acreage of developed land in the Bay Area expanded by just  10 percent (measured in terms of U.S. Census block groups). Indeed, the Bay Area’s developed footprint grew by the smallest number of acres — and the third-smallest percentage — of any of the nation’s 10 largest metro areas during this period. Only New York City and Los Angeles registered similarly small growth rates for greenfield development.",
"T11T12A","Transit Ridership","Regional Performance","While transit ridership has been on the rise in the last few years, it remains below the modern-era peak achieved in 2001.","On a typical weekday in 2016, Bay Area residents boarded buses, trains and ferries approximately 1.8 million times. While ridership has surpassed pre-recession levels - growing robustly for the fifth consecutive year - the region is still just shy of its modern historic peak of weekday boardings, which was reached in 2001. On a per-capita basis, transit use is well below the levels of the early 1990s. The average resident boarded transit 79 times per year in 1991, while in 2016, this had fallen to 70 trips per year - an 11 percent decline over 25 years.","Short- and long-term ridership trends indicate an ongoing shift in transit demand away from local bus services and toward regional rail systems. While ridership on rail systems has grown steadily over the decades, bus ridership has dropped significantly. On a per-capita basis, ridership on Bay Area buses has fallen by one-third since 1991. Given that the majority of Bay Area transit trips take place on buses - rather than trains - this has played a major role in the overall per-capita decline in regional transit use."
"T11T12B","Transit Ridership","Local Focus","After several years of robust growth, ridership growth on both BART and Caltrain slowed in 2016.","In 2016, BART and Caltrain set records for average daily ridership. Caltrain ridership grew just 1.5 percent year-over-year, however, after climbing by 6 percent to 17 percent annually over the previous five years. Since 1991, Caltrain recorded a daily ridership increase of more than 200 percent, while BART ridership grew by more than 76 percent. For both operators, ridership growth since the end of the Great Recession has occurred despite only limited expansion to service hours over the same time period.","It's a different story for bus operators, however. Though bus ridership has rebounded slightly in the last few years, most agencies have seen significant per-capita declines in ridership over the last few decades. While some of these declines are a result of service cuts, ridership has declined at an even faster rate. AC Transit, VTA and SamTrans all posted per-capita ridership declines of 30 percent to 40 percent since 1991. San Francisco Muni, which provides nearly half of all transit trips in the region, registered an 11 percent decline in per-capita bus ridership in the same period. However, the recent population and jobs boom in San Francisco has had a positive impact on Muni ridership with per-capita boardings increasing markedly in 2016 for not only light rail but also for its bus services."
"T11T12C","Transit Ridership","National Context","After adjusting for population growth, only four of the ten major metros in the United States saw real growth in transit ridership in 2016.","Per-capita transit ridership trended upward in 2016 in Houston, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and New York, but stayed flat or declined in all other large metros. Annual bus boardings in Miami and Los Angeles continued to decline, causing overall per-capita transit ridership in both metros to drop for the second year in a row. Washington - which ranks second among the major U.S. metros for per-capita transit ridership - had 6 percent fewer transit boardings per-capita in 2016 as both bus and rail ridership continued their long-term decline. Ridership loss in 2016 was particularly steep in the nation's capital as major maintenance work disrupted service on the Area's heavy rail system, causing many rail passengers to switch modes.","With the key exception of New York, all of the nation's top metro areas have seen a decline in per-capita ridership since the end of the recession. New York is the only metro area to see significant long-term gains in ridership, with the average resident now boarding transit nearly 42 percent more often than in 1991. Benefiting from reinvestment in aging infrastructure, booming residential and commercial development in the urban core, and improved safety for riders at all times of day, New York has been the core engine of transit ridership growth not only in the Northeast but for the entire United States."
"T13A","Transit Cost-Effectiveness","Regional Performance","The Bay Area has stabilized transit operating costs and is also relying on larger fare contributions from riders.","Although per-rider operating costs ticked slightly upward in 2015, transit cost-effectiveness has been relatively stable over the last decade-plus. Combined with rising revenues from increased fares, the subsidy required to operate service (net cost per boarding) actually declined by 17 percent between 2003 and 2015. Booming ridership on higher-fare systems like Caltrain and BART has contributed to this trend.","Muni remained the regional leader for lowest total operating cost per boarding in 2015, although costs ticked very slightly upwards in the last few years. When it comes to net operating cost per boarding, BART and Caltrain have made the greatest strides in recent years. Both systems saw nearly 70 percent declines in the past dozen years, reflecting surging ridership on both systems. BART riders paid $3.43 out of each $4.29 in total cost per boarding, requiring only 86 cents in operating subsidy, whereas on systems like SamTrans and VTA it was around $1.00 out of $7.00, requiring $6.00 in operating subsidy in 2015."
"T13B","Transit Cost-Effectiveness","National Context","High costs put the Bay Area in the middle of the pack when it comes to transit cost-effectiveness.","The Bay Area ranks fourth among the 10 largest U.S. metro areas for its transit systems' average operating cost per passenger boarding and net cost per boarding, despite relatively high fares across the region which contribute to relatively strong farebox recovery. Due in large part to very high ridership numbers, the New York metro Area's transit network is by far the nation's most cost-effective. The Bay Area's middling transit cost-effectiveness rankings are largely the result of the region's high operating costs.","While the Bay Area's transit system is by no means the most cost-effective in America, transit operators in Dallas and Houston experience even higher operating costs per boarding. Reflecting their relatively transit-incompatible service areas - and a greater share of low-income or transit-dependent riders - these systems have net operating costs per boarding that are 60 to 85 percent higher than the Bay Area."
"T14T15A","Daily Miles Traveled","Regional Performance","Per-capita miles traveled have remained relatively stable for the last decade, even as the region's population grew by more than a half-million people.","Although the number of daily miles logged by vehicles in the Bay Area declined during the Great Recession, daily miles traveled has spiked since 2010. The region has surpassed previous records for this indicator with vehicle miles traveled now totaling 172 million on a typical day. On a per-capita basis, daily travel in the Bay Area has stabilized since 2005 at approximately 23 miles per person. This suggests that recent growth in total mileage is primarily driven by population growth rather than longer travel distances.","At around 30 miles per resident, the North Bay counties of Marin and Solano had the highest average daily vehicle travel of the nine Bay Area counties in 2015. For Marin County, this figure represents a reduction from a daily VMT average that ran in the 30-plus range throughout the preceding decade. Conversely, at just 10 miles, San Francisco has by far the lowest VMT per capita."
"T14T15B","Daily Miles Traveled","National Context","The Bay Area's per-capita miles traveled is in the middle of the pack nationally.","Bookended by the metro areas of New York and Philadelphia on the low end and Atlanta and Dallas on the high end, the San Francisco Bay Area finds itself in the middle of the pack in terms of daily miles traveled. As of 2015, the latest year for which figures are available, the Bay had the fifth-lowest level of average daily driving. Surprisingly, the Bay Area is virtually tied with Los Angeles for per-capita miles traveled, belying the latter metro's auto-oriented reputation.",
"T7A","Time Spent in Congestion","Regional Performance","Traffic congestion is outpacing regional economic growth.","While there are more transportation alternatives than ever before, today's congestion is worse than what was experienced during previous economic booms. Since the peak of the dot-com boom in 2000, per-commuter congested delay increased by about 65 percent while population and jobs grew by 15 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Commuters are likely also experiencing delays on arterials and local roads, although there is insufficient data to quantify these trends.",
"T16A","Street Pavement Condition","Regional Performance","The regional average PCI score held steady at 67 in 2018, with roads in the region rated as fair overall.","Regionwide, street pavement conditions generally have been stable since 2003, the first year data were collected. Since then, the average PCI score in the Bay Area has ranged from 63 to 67, putting our local streets and roads in “fair” condition. While local governments continue to work to improve their pavement condition, aging infrastructure remains a challenge for the region.","While pavement conditions across the region largely have been stable in recent years, performance gains are more evident at the county level. San Francisco and Marin counties had the biggest improvements in PCI from 2010 to 2018, gaining eight and six points, respectively. Notably, after three years in which pavement condition in all counties either improved or held steady, Napa and Sonoma counties experienced one point declines in PCI in 2018. Whether due to direct damage or lack of investment, this decline may be linked to the October 2017 North Bay wildfires."
"T16B","Street Pavement Condition","Regional Distribution","Pavement condition in most cities has changed only marginally over the past decade.","The majority of Bay Area cities and towns have seen minimal shifts in their pavement conditions over the past 10 years. For example, many of the region’s most populous cities – including San Jose, Oakland, Fremont and Hayward – have only shifted by a few PCI points over the past decade. Yet there have also been some success stories, particularly in smaller suburban jurisdictions like El Cerrito, Orinda and Woodside.",
"T16C","Street Pavement Condition","Local Focus","Pavement conditions vary widely from city to city.","Close to three-quarters of Bay Area cities have pavement rated as fair or good (PCI score between 60 and 79), including the region’s two largest cities – San Jose and San Francisco. In total, 74 percent of the region’s population lives in jurisdictions with fair or good pavement, with another 6 percent living in places with pavement in excellent condition (PCI score of 80 or higher). Notable exceptions include the region’s third most populous city, Oakland, along with its neighbors Berkeley and San Leandro – all of which have “at risk” PCIs between 50 and 59.","North Bay communities dominate the list of Bay Area communities with the lowest PCI scores. Among these are Larkspur, Petaluma, Vallejo and Sebastopol. Some of the region’s smoothest roads can be found in East Bay cities such as Brentwood, Dublin and El Cerrito. Not surprisingly, superior pavement conditions are often found in newer communities, where many streets were constructed in the last 20 years or so, as well as in jurisdictions that have passed funding measures aimed at road rehabilitation."
"T17A","Highway Pavement Condition","Regional Performance","While still better than past decades, Bay Area highway pavement conditions have gotten worse since 2013.","The percentage of Bay Area highway lane-miles with pavement in distressed condition increased from 21 percent in 2013 to 25 percent in 2015, but this remains 10 percentage points lower than the level registered nearly two decades ago. The recent dip in the regional highway pavement quality is attributed mainly to deterioration on the heavily-traveled I-580 and I-880 corridors in Alameda County. As state and local agencies rehabilitate and reconstruct roads in the most distressed conditions, highway segments across the region continue to deteriorate due to increasing age, traffic and unfavorable weather conditions.","Over the past decade, our region has benefited from pavement improvement projects such as those along Interstate 80 and U.S. Highway 101 funded by the 2006 Proposition 1B bond measure and the 2009 federal stimulus package. With the passage of Senate Bill 1, which is forecast to generate billions more in funding for highway repairs, the Bay Area is well positioned to make further progress on this metric in the years to come."
"T17B","Highway Pavement Condition","Local Focus","Pavement preservation for the region's busiest freeways has been prioritized over other state highways.","The Bay Area's best highway pavement conditions generally are found on major freeways, with Interstates 80 and 280 as well as U.S. 101 standing out in particular. These highways have among the highest traffic volumes of any Bay Area roadway. Pavement quality is significantly lower on many non-freeway routes, with 57 percent of the 231 lane-miles on State Route 82 (El Camino Real) and 38 percent of State Route 1 in distressed condition.","The Bay Area's smoothest highways generally are found in suburban portions of the region - in Contra Costa, Santa Clara and Solano counties in particular. Heavy use of urban freeways in San Francisco has resulted in pavement conditions far worse than other Bay Area counties. Though San Francisco routes account for just 4 percent of all distressed highway pavement in the region, 39 percent of the highway lane-miles in the city are in poor shape."
"T18A","Bridge Condition","Regional Performance","Bay Area bridge conditions have significantly improved over the past decade.","Bay Area bridges and overpasses are in their best shape since 1992 - the earliest year on record - thanks to substantial efforts to improve the seismic and structural safety of these critical facilities. Poor bridge conditions hit a peak in 2004 when nearly one-third of the Bay Area's bridges were identified as structurally deficient. Over the past 12 years, seismic retrofit programs on highway bridges as well as upgrades to elevated freeway structures helped the region reverse that trajectory. As a result, the share of bridges flagged as deficient fell by a remarkable 25 percentage points - and stood at just 7 percent as of 2016.",
"T18B","Bridge Condition","Local Focus","While most Bay Area counties have seen improved bridge and overpass conditions over the last decade, in recent years San Francisco has experienced the greatest progress.","The share of structurally deficient bridges and overpasses in San Francisco County in 2016 are at an all-time recorded low. Numerous structural repairs were made between 2012 and 2014 and the share of structurally deficient deck area fell by nearly 70 percent in that two-year period. Sonoma, Solano, Contra Costa and Alameda counties have also seen improvements over the past decade, though the rate of repair has slowed considerably in the last four years. In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, the seismic retrofits of those counties' toll bridges have contributed to their strong performance.",
"T18C","Bridge Condition","National Context","As a result of significant investments, the Bay Area no longer has the greatest share of structurally deficient bridges of any major metro area.","Overall, every metro area except for Miami has seen improvements in bridge condition since 2000. Having reduced its share of structurally deficient bridge deck area by 25 percentage points since 2005, the Bay Area finds itself in the middle of the pack of the nation's top 10 metro areas for bridge condition. New York now claims the bottom rung for worst bridge condition, with structurally deficient bridge deck area shares of 11 percent. While the Bay Area had seen by far the largest gains, Los Angeles has also made notable progress over the last four years.","Metro areas in the South generally have the fewest structurally deficient bridges - Houston, Miami, Atlanta and Dallas all have deficient shares below 3 percent. This trend reflects the fact that these regions, due to their recent growth, generally have newer infrastructure and many have fewer geographical features requiring this type of infrastructure."
"T19A","Transit Asset Condition","Regional Performance","While the vast majority of the Bay Area's rail guideway is in good condition, over half of regional rail vehicles have surpassed their useful life.","Transit asset condition performance varies widely in the Bay Area. Rail operators have excelled in maintaining tracks, with less than two percent of all rail mileage impacted by speed restrictions. Condition of revenue vehicles, or the vehicles that provide service to passengers, varies by type of service. For example, none of the Bay Area's light rail vehicles are past their useful life, while 50 to 80 percent of longer-distance service-providing commuter and heavy rail vehicles are. With new BART trains already in service and plans for electric Caltrain locomotives to debut in 2022, regional performance in this area is expected to improve in future years.","The maintenance of transit systems may be less visible to the passenger's eye, but assets that support these activities are critical to maintaining quality service. Based on federal performance measures, nearly a quarter of the Bay Area's maintenance facilities are deemed to be in poor or failed condition. Among major transit providers, BART's maintenance facilities are in the best condition, with just ten percent rated as poor or failed. Meanwhile, Caltrain and Golden Gate Transit report that 75 and 85 percent of their facilities rate as poor or failed, respectively."
"T19B","Transit Asset Condition","Local Focus","Maintaining transit assets in good condition is a challenge for agencies large and small.","All Bay Area transit providers reported at least one asset category in which their share of obsolete assets was higher than the regional average. Of the six largest transit operators, Caltrain is a prime example of the region's aging infrastructure. While Caltrain has no track mileage restrictions, its share of revenue vehicles, non-revenue vehicles, and facilities deemed obsolete are all well above the regional average.","Muni's 2017 debut of new light rail vehicles represented the system's first new light rail vehicles in 14 years. These vehicles will be used to expand service through the Central Subway and to replace aging vehicles in the years ahead. Through regular fleet replacement, Muni has maintained the lowest share of revenue vehicles past their useful life of all major operators in the Bay Area, despite having nearly twice as many vehicles as the next largest operator."
"T1T2A","Commute Mode Choice","Regional Performance","2018 saw the share of automobile-based commuting decline in the Bay Area for the eighth year in a row.","Regional mode shares have been changing for the first time in decades. While three-quarters of residents still drive to work on a typical workday, the share of residents making this choice has declined by over 7 percentage points since 2000. This trend has accelerated in recent years, powered primarily by growth in public transit and active modes like walking and biking.","Transit mode shares increased by 2 percentage points in the last decade – the first time this share has markedly increased in more than five decades. Hovering at 12 percent over the past few years, the share of Bay Area public transit commutes is at its highest level since 1970. Walking and biking to work have also become more popular, especially in San Francisco where active transportation has posted the greatest gains in recent years."
"T1T2B","Commute Mode Choice","Regional Distribution","Shifts in regional mode choice have largely been driven by changing commute behaviors in four specific counties.","While commuting patterns have been relatively stable over time in the North Bay and South Bay, this has not been the case elsewhere. In Alameda, Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties, the share of residents driving to work has dropped by four to seven percentage points since 2008. Many residents in these counties commute to jobs in San Francisco, where an economic boom has added just under 200,000 new jobs during this period. To avoid increasingly congested freeways and limited parking, the bulk of these commuters shifted to public transit – boosting BART and Caltrain ridership to record levels.","While Contra Costa County has not experienced changes as dramatic as those seen in other Bay Area counties in recent years, county residents have made consistent and significant shifts in their commute choices over the long term. Since 1960, the share of auto commutes has dropped six percentage points while the share of transit commutes has increased by the same amount; this shift was due in large part to the construction and expansion of the BART system across the county."
"T1T2C","Commute Mode Choice","Local Focus","San Francisco and inner East Bay communities lead the region in commuting by public transit.","At 34 percent in 2018, San Francisco remains the regional leader in the percentage of residents who take transit to work, which includes both public options like Muni and BART as well as employer-provided shuttles. Adding in walking, bicycling and telecommuting, we find that 60 percent of San Franciscans get to work each day without an automobile, a strikingly high mode share for a U.S. city. At the same time, commuters from some central Bay Area cities are outpacing other large urban centers in using transit to get to their jobs. Residents of East Bay cities like Albany, Emeryville, El Cerrito, and Berkeley have transit mode shares even higher than much larger urban centers like San Jose and Oakland.",
"T1T2D","Commute Mode Choice","National Context","Only New York has a greater share of commuters who choose to leave the car at home.","More than one-quarter of Bay Area residents choose non-auto modes to get to work, slightly more than Washington, D.C. or Chicago. Only New York, where just half of commuters drive alone each day, significantly outperforms the Bay Area in this regard. The Bay Area performs similarly for other non-automobile modes, ranking fourth for transit commuters, second for walk commuters, and first for bike commuters.","In Miami, Atlanta, Dallas and Houston, approximately 80 percent of residents drive alone to work each day. While the data indicate substantial differences between the Bay Area and these Sunbelt metros, the reality is a bit more complex. The South Bay actually has mode shares quite similar to Miami or Atlanta, due in part to its rapid development in the era of the automobile. Meanwhile, San Francisco and other core cities have mode shares that more closely resemble New York."
"T3T4A","Commute Time","Regional Performance","Commute times have continued to increase, with the average Bay Area commute taking 31 minutes in 2018.","Across all modes, the average Bay Area commute takes longer than ever before and now lasts over 32 minutes door-to-door. Increasing congestion and longer-distance commutes to job centers in San Francisco and Silicon Valley have contributed to this trend. Importantly, how someone chooses to get to work affects their commuting time. Commuters that drive alone spent 30 minutes getting to work, while those taking public transit spent nearly twice as long, at 51 minutes.","Longer transit commute times are not surprising considering nearly two-thirds of transit commuters work in San Francisco. Crowding on Muni and longer trip distances for on BART and Caltrain for workers residing outside of San Francisco make it difficult to get to work under 30 minutes. This results in above-average travel times for transit users. Since 2008, the share of transit commutes longer than an hour each way has increased by 20 percent."
"T3T4B","Commute Time","Regional Distribution","While the majority of Bay Area residents have reasonable commute times, 15 percent have extreme commutes – lasting more than one hour each way.","While more than half of workers across the region have an average commute of under 30 minutes, commuting times vary widely based on where people live and work, and how they travel. Across the region, 15 percent of all commutes lasted longer than an hour in 2018 – an increase of 5 percent since 2008. Contra Costa County residents lead the pack with nearly one in five commuters traveling over one hour each way, though Alameda and Solano counties are also home to sizeable shares of extreme commuters.",
"T3T4C","Commute Time","Local Focus","Commuters living in Contra Costa County spend significantly more time getting to work than residents of other counties.","The five cities with the longest average commute time in 2018 – Antioch, Brentwood, Pittsburg, Hercules, and Oakley – are all located in Contra Costa County. Residents of these cities each took an average of 40 minutes or more to get to work, with transit commutes stretching to well over an hour each way. Commute time trends in these communities illustrate the impact of the regional jobs-housing imbalance, with many residents commuting to distant job centers in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.","With commute times averaging less than 22 minutes, residents of cities in Napa and Sonoma counties – including Calistoga, St. Helena, Napa, Healdsburg and Santa Rosa – have the fastest commutes in the region, influenced in part by shorter commute distances and less pervasive congestion. These cities are joined by several jobs-rich communities in Silicon Valley such as Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, Menlo Park and Los Altos where residents spend under 23 minutes getting to work each day."
"T3T4D","Commute Time","National Context","When it comes to average commute time, the Bay Area falls in the middle of the pack among major metro areas.","The nation’s major metros all have similar commute times, ranging from 27 to 36 minutes. In 2010, the Bay Area ranked 2nd for fastest commutes, but since then the region has seen the largest increase in commute time among major metros, falling to 7th place in 2018. Enduring traffic congestion, a relatively high transit mode share, and growing distances for auto and transit commuters alike have all fueled the Bay Area’s increase in commute time in comparison to our major U.S. metro area peers.","Dallas and Houston have the quickest commute times, while commuters in New York and Washington, D.C. spend the most time getting to work. In New York, the high percentage of commuters on public transit increases the overall commute time to more than 53 minutes each day. In Washington, D.C., transit commutes are among the fastest, but solo drivers and carpoolers have the longest commute times of all metro areas."
"T5A","Commute Patterns","Local Focus","While more than half of all Bay Area residents work in the county where they live, San Francisco and Silicon Valley continue to import workers from other communities, primarily in the East Bay.","The Bay Area’s dynamic economy and transportation system provide workers access to jobs throughout the region’s 7,000-square-mile area. Although many people travel across county borders as part of their commute, nearly 60 percent work and live in the same county. In Santa Clara County, 87 percent stay in-county – the highest in the Bay Area – with its numerous job centers also attracting thousands of commuters from outside of the nine-county Bay Area. By contrast, four in ten Contra Costa County residents commute to neighboring counties for work.","San Francisco leads the Bay Area in attracting the most workers from outside its boundaries, with a net inflow of more than 200,000 commuters each day. Santa Clara County follows with a net inflow of 120,000 commuters each day. Both counties attract workers from suburban areas, particularly San Mateo and Alameda counties. In addition to commute patterns within the nine counties, the region experiences a net inflow of an additional 120,000 commuters from outside the Bay Area each day."
"T6A","Traffic Volumes at Regional Gateways","Regional Performance","The region’s strong economy and high housing costs have contributed to a spike in traffic from neighboring counties.","The Great Recession had a profound effect on interregional traffic volumes, halting two decades of steady growth. Up until 2006, the Bay Area witnessed significant growth in traffic entering from neighboring counties, contributing to regional congestion challenges. The recession reversed this trend from 2006 through 2012, but the resurgent Bay Area economy has since powered growth in traffic for five years in a row, pushing gateway volumes past their pre-Recession peak in 2006 and to new highs in 2017.","Interregional traffic volumes have remained constant or steadily grown over time at four of the top five regional gateways. The one exception to this trend is Interstate 205/Interstate 580, which connects San Joaquin County to Alameda County. Traffic volumes on this corridor continue to vary based on the megaregional housing and jobs markets. Interregional volumes increased dramatically in the early 2000s alongside the real estate boom in San Joaquin County, then dipped sharply during the economic downturn that started in 2008."
"T7B","Time Spent in Congestion","Local Focus","Bay Area freeway congestion is worst in the evenings, with each of the top ten most congested corridors experiencing delay in the evening peak.","While congestion only generates a few minutes of delay for the average commuter, commuters in a handful of high-demand corridors experience far worse conditions. The top ten most congested segments constitute nearly half of all regional freeway congestion, with just the top two segments along the Bay Bridge corridor constituting 16 percent all Bay Area traffic congestion. While congestion on other corridors in the region mirrors typical commute patterns, the Bay Bridge is affected by congestion for long periods throughout the day.","Over three-quarters of all congested delay on the Bay Area's freeway network occurs in Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties. Congestion in these counties remained stable between 2016 and 2017, with total hours of vehicle delay decreasing by about two percent in Contra Costa County and increasing at roughly the same rate in San Francisco."
"T8A","Miles Traveled in Congestion","Regional Performance","While congestion has doubled over the past decade, it affects only a fraction of miles driven on regional freeways.","Congestion remained at record-high levels in 2016, with six percent of freeway miles driven affected by traffic congestion. This trend has been driven by worsening conditions at long-standing regional bottlenecks on freeways crisscrossing San Francisco, the East Bay and the South Bay. While past years have seen significant annual growth in congested miles traveled, traffic congestion did not notably get worse in 2016 compared to the previous year, despite a booming economy and corresponding growth in jobs and population. And, as this data makes clear, the effects of regional traffic congestion are more limited in extent than some drivers might think: 94 percent of miles are driven in uncongested conditions.","For the second year in a row, San Francisco topped the list of the region's counties with the greatest share of miles driven in congestion. At 9.5 percent in 2016, it continues to exceed congestion levels in nearby Alameda County, which has historically been the most congested in the Bay Area. The latest data for these counties, when considered alongside those of neighboring counties, reflect slower freeway speeds and increasing congestion in the urban core. On the other hand, in the more northerly counties of Sonoma, Napa and Solano, drivers spend very little time in congested conditions. These counties have seen little-to-no growth in congestion over the past decade."
"T9A","Travel Time Reliability","Regional Performance","Despite increased congestion in the region, travel time reliability on Bay Area freeways remains remarkably consistent.","In 2016, travel time reliability on Bay Area highways shifted slightly, with the morning peak period becoming a bit more reliable while the evening peak period became less so. This is due in part to rising congestion, especially in the evening peak, which results in less consistent travel times. Despite these diverging trends, however, travel time reliability as measured by buffer time index has remained similar since 2010. During peak periods over the past half-decade, a driver with a 30-minute typical commute would need to leave approximately 11 minutes early to be confident of an on-time arrival. Reliability has remained largely stable even as traffic congestion has increased (up 60 percent since 2000, as measured by congested delay per commuter). In many parts of the region, heavily traveled corridors continue to be ""reliably congested,"" - providing consistent travel times even in near-gridlock conditions.",
"T9B","Travel Time Reliability","Local Focus","Morning commuters on State Route 242 and evening commuters on State Route 92 experience the most unreliable travel times in the region.","Daily travel time reliability patterns for individual freeway segments stay surprisingly consistent year after year. State Route 242, for instance, has ranked as the Bay Area's most unpredictable freeway corridor during the morning peak period every year since 2010. This means if your morning commute takes you along southbound State Route 242 in eastern Contra Costa County, you should expect the unexpected. With a buffer time index of 1.16 in 2016, drivers should plan eight extra minutes to travel the short 3.4-mile segment from State Route 4 to Interstate 680. Similar conditions exist on eastbound State Route 92 in San Mateo County during the evening peak. Unpredictable traffic backups from the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge and the US-101 interchange make this freeway segment the most unreliable drive in the Bay Area on weekday evenings.","Shifts in the annual buffer time indices for specific freeway segments do reflect some of the changing traffic problems in our region. For example, the 2016 evening commute on eastbound Interstate 80 and eastbound State Route 4 had markedly more unreliable travel times. These segments linking eastern Contra Costa County, Solano County and the Sacramento region to Bay Area job centers grew more unreliable due to the combination of increased traffic volumes and ongoing highway construction projects."
