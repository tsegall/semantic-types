I recently completed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy. Everyone on this planet that I owed money to was listed on that bankruptcy. No entity was left out. 

Shortly after the discharge of my bankruptcy I requested a credit report. Mysteriously, a collection that was never on my account prior to the discharge suddenly showed up as a collection AFTER the bankruptcy. The collection, IS NOT MINE. The collection shows as a joint account from XXXX from 2009. First and foremost, I have NEVER had a joint account with anyone. Second, I currently have a XXXX account which I just barely opened last year and it is, IN GOOD STANDING. 

First thing I did was contact the collection agency, SEVERAL TIMES. The agency is, Creditor Information   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX When I contacted the collection agency and finally talked to someone it was not the person I was supposed to talk to. They refused to transfer me to anyone else. Would not even transfer me to a supervisor. They just kept telling me that they could not remove it because I did not have an account number. I explained I did not have an account number because IT IS NOT MY ACCOUNT. I also explained about the bankruptcy and that if it was my account it would have been listed prior to discharge. She refused to hear me out and said she could not help me without an account number. 

I contacted and emailed their accounts "" escalations '' department and left at least 10 messages with my name and phone number and nature of my call. I have yet to receive a call back OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. Below is a list of contacts I have utilized : Telephone Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Client Services Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Escalations Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Email : XXXX Shortly after informing them on a voicemail that this was not my account and that I had a bankruptcy of which this account was not a part of, mysteriously somehow without a supposed "" account number : '' they were able to find the account and report to Equifax that it was in my bankruptcy. WHICH IT IS NOT. ( I have a lawyer and he can verify this information. ) When I saw that on my report I exploded. I tried reporting both equifax and the collection company to the FTC. So far I have not heard back. I sent an email to every executive I could find in Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX and both XXXX  and XXXX do not have this collection on my reports and have responded to my request to make sure it does not get on the report. 

A XXXX executive responded by giving me a letter specifically stating that my account is in good standing and I do not have a collections. I sent this to everyone and still no help or changes have been made to my report. 

The people who have never responded are Equifax, except to deny my dispute and they have made it impossible for me to access my account information on equifax to keep disputing it. They keep saying my password is wrong and when i call them they say they fixed it but they never do and I have not had access for over a month now because they seem to be blocking my ability to get into the account. They tell me to call them and I do and I do everything they ask and I still cant get access. I have done that at least 3 times or more. 

I have never heard from XXXX XXXX XXXX. If they cant help me without an account number how are they able to change the false information they are reporting to equifax and falsely claim that the collection is on my bankruptcy? IT IS NOT!!!!!!! BECAUSE IT IS NOT MY ACCOUNT. I did not include it in my bankruptcy because IT IS NOT MINE!!!!! To me this suggests their is illegal practices being coordinated inside both companies. 

I promise you I spend most days crying about the entire ordeal. I am a XXXX Veteran with XXXX and this has sent me into XXXX, made me XXXX and cause me to exacerbate my XXXX. I do not know how much more I can take. I have taken several months to do my bankruptcy as perfectly as possible. I have contacted a law firm to find out if I have a lawsuit against both companies.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.","UT","847XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","2018-02-21T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2820481"

They then asked me for my password to XXXX and I gave them my banking information and social security number as well. I had to make 5 initial payments of XXXX for processing fees, is what I was told. The payments were set up as automatic withdraw with my debit card, I have made 3 of those 5 payments. I then contacted my actual loan service provider that is listed in my XXXX to tell them that I was only able to make half payment this week and then the other half next and was told that I do not owe any money at this point in time and that my loan was to be submitted next XXXX ( 2019 ) for student loan forgiveness acceptance. The person that I spoke with today informed me that Premier Student Loan Center was probably a fraudulent company and to not give them any more money and to immediately contact my bank and you guys.",,"PremierÂ StudentÂ LoanÂ Center","UT",,,"Consent provided","Web","2018-07-09T00:00:00.000","Closed with monetary relief","true","N/A","2958024"

"2017-02-03T00:00:00.000","Credit card",,"Transaction issue",,"I applied for a new credit card, the Chase XXXX XXXX and was approved. The card comes with a very hefty annual fee of {$450.00}, but it also comes with a fantastic opening bonus of XXXX ultimate reward points. Upon receiving the card, I immediately set out to try to spend the {$4000.00} dollar in XXXX months necessary to receive the opening bonus. I tried to make a large purchase at a local store ( the purchase was still only a tiny fraction of my revolving credit limite on the card ) and Chase declined the transaction. I immediately called their fraud department and they explained that they were being cautious because it was a new card. I understood XXXX % and the fraud department cleared the card for immediate use. Still at the store, I tried running the card again and was again declined despite just being told the alert on the card had been cleared. Embarrassed at being declined twice, I resorted to using another credit card with which I had no issue. About XXXX minutes later, I received a call from the Chase fraud department alerting me about the second declined transaction. After speaking with the fraud team, I again cleared the alert on my account. Thinking the cause of the second transaction being declined was because of the close proximity to the first declined transaction, I went that night to another store of the same chain to attempt another purchase. For a third time, my transaction was declined. Again I called the fraud team and cleared the alert on the account. 
A few days later, I attempted to make the same purchase again, and for a fourth time I was declined. Now fuming, I called Chase and demanded to speak with a supervisor. After waiting XXXX minutes on the line with no supervisor available, I lost patience and had the representative clear the alert on the account. He assured me there would be no more declined transaction, and gave me his personal word. 
I tried to make the purchase the next day and was finally successful. However, I still had {$3000.00} spend till I reached the opening bonus. So I returned to the store for another large purchase and low and behold, I was declined for a fifth time. So once again I call Chase to clear the alert. But this time, I also warn the agent that I am going make a purchase of approximately XXXX dollars at such and such time. The agent said she had noted the account and there should be no trouble with the transaction. 
I go to the store and, I ca n't believe it, but for a sixth time my transaction is declined. After clearing the alert on my account so many times and giving a call ahead to warn of the large purchase, Chase still had the gall to block the transaction. 
After spending such a long time embarrassed at the line in the store and calling Chase to clear the alerts I have come to a conclusion. I believe that Chase is deliberately flagging large transactions on annual fee accounts with opening bonuses to make it more difficult for their customers to reach to opening bonus. By doing so, they reap the benefit of getting a new customer without having to take the loss of the opening bonus. Instead of maybe XXXX % of their customers reaching the opening bonus ( this is a guess ), by practicing overzealous fraud protection on these accounts they could reduce that amount to say XXXX %. This is a deceptive practice that preys on consumer rights and the CFPB should launch an investigation into this issue.",,"JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.","UT","840XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-02-03T00:00:00.000","Closed with non-monetary relief","true","No","2325856"

XX/XX/XXXX I was in poor financial condition and started job hunting ; I was hired by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At that time I retained "" XXXX XXXX '' to try and clean up my debts without filing bankruptcy and began paying so much a month ( {$780.00} ) to build up an account to pay the debts and legal fees. We had progressed well and settled a portion of the debts I had incurred. XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX at work ( Workman 's Comp reduced income to XXXX ) and was out until XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX we started hearing from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) through the XXXX District Court of Utah and XXXX XXXX XXXX. For every submittal by XXXX, XXXX XXXX countered with their own court submittal. This went back and forth 4 or 5 times until XX/XX/XXXX with several conversations of settlement. XXXX was very abrasive and cursed at the XXXX XXXX people trying to settle the case, he would not settle. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ( lied, said I never responded to the court ) ) convinced or bought this judge to put a judgement in on me, without my day in court and any arbitration. Per the contract I was to have my arbitration and a day in court. XXXX told XXXX XXXX that I no longer had a contract because these carpet baggers had bought this debt so they were no longer responsible for the stipulations of the contract. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX tried again to settle and offered everything I had in the account ( {$11000.00} ) they said no and cursed them out again and said they want it all. In the same month we submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX but XXXX did n't even respond, he ignored both arbitrations attempts. XX/XX/XXXX I found out they had garnished my pay check at XXXX but also my Utah state tax return was taken. XX/XX/XXXX the tax return was a {$3200.00} ( a write off because of the oil loss ), so they have garnished approximately {$7500.00} XX/XX/XXXX.XX/XX/XXXX they will take approximately {$9000.00} but not State tax return because the oil relief is over and now I owe money this year. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down and investigated by Fed 's for taking to much in fees up front and additional fees throughout each settlement process. Now the garnishing continues my money is tied up ( to settle ) at XXXX XXXX and I still have a corrupt lawyer and Judge to contend with day in day out. I had an original amount of {$20000.00}. The oil fraud was turned over to the Utah Commission and determined they were fraudulent and I filed an additional complaint against XXXX XXXX after finding they had over charged everyone beyond the normal fee structure. The only thing I know is lawyers are created to prey on other peoples misfortunes and make them pay and pay whether or not they say they are on your side. I have all the documentation sent to me and everything I submitted in return. I also have the court records that show no notice of a hearing and no chance to arbitrate a settlement, I 'm discussed.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","CITIBANK, N.A.","UT","841XX","Older American, Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","2016-02-28T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","No","1807589"

When that did not work, in XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to short sale the home, but XXXX XXXX was unwilling to work with me regarding that also. Several different departments at XXXX XXXX suggested I dont pay and fall behind a couple of months then they would be more likely to work with me to help reduce my mortgage payment.

In XX/XX/XXXX the company that was trying to help with the short sale contacted me and informed me that XXXX XXXX had filed a Notice of Default and had begun the foreclosure process. During that time, I had never even missed payment. Not realizing that these were lies, I moved from my home. I filed a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX. At the time of the filing, my house was surrendered to XXXX XXXX. I made every payment to the Trustee on time for 4 years and my bankruptcy was discharged in good standing on XX/XX/XXXX.

I signed into my report on XX/XX/2018 to see a new collection from Diversified Consultants Inc. posted on XX/XX/2018.

I immediately called XXXX directly and told the operator about my prior experience with XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked the operator to review the new collection from Diversified Consultants Inc. The Equifax operator confirmed that the new collection was from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$300.00}. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX posted this same collection on my credit report in XX/XX/2018. I was informed via XXXX via text on XX/XX/2018. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and the operator told me the collection was from XXXX XXXX XXXX and to call XXXX XXXX XXXX for more information. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and the operator confirmed my account with them was in excellent standing and that XXXX XXXX XXXX had not sent me to collections. When I called XXXX XXXX XXXX back the new operator told me that the collection had been paid in full and that they no longer had a collection account for me. The operator gave me this information Account number XXXX Address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA. 
I called XXXX XXXX XXXX back with the account and address and XXXX XXXX XXXX had no accounts under this information. 

I am concerned that both XXXX XXXX XXXX and Diversified Consultants Inc. are scams. 

Equifax is removing the new collection posted of Diversified Consultants Inc. over the next 30 days.

At the same time I have been refinancing my house with another lender. The following things have happened over the last month as my new lender has tried to payoff SLS : -No information available about loan details when I initially called to talk about details, escrow, etc. Data from XXXX XXXX loan had not been updated in SLS system yet. 
-Personal account info is not available online due to their online system having "" being down ''. I continue to not be able to get details on my loan unless I call. 
-SLS claims to have paid my property taxes from my escrow, but payment has not been received by my county. 
-Due to non-payment of property tax, my county has  assessed me a penalty. I should n't be responsible for this. 
-My new lender sent in the payoff amount SLS gave them, but SLS claims the amount was less than the payoff. 
-SLS eventually dispersed a property tax payment, but for some reason made a DOUBLE payment out of my loan balance, which is the reason they are claiming my lender is short on the payoff amount. The amount short on payoff is exactly the same amount of my property taxes. My property tax payment is XXXX. But they paid XXXX. 

It seems that there is no accountability by SLS to me as a consumer. I had to argue with customer service telling them that they keep changing the payoff amount from the original quote. The lady told me that I had to pay the largest amount. I kept asking her why the payoff keeps getting higher. She could n't tell me until she looked closer at my account and discovered that SLS had accidentally made a DOUBLE property tax payment. 

I am absolutely upset with this company. My hands are tied because I ca n't access my online account to look at any details. They are keeping me in the dark! They keep increasing my payoff amount to my new lender, because they accidentally made a double payment. This is preventing my lender from paying off the account.

It was released I was able to sign up for account I added my debit card I added my bank accounts. Ive verified my identity I verified the accounts, So I sent XXXX the {$400.00}. He was having a hard time being able to accept the payment. But it was sent to him he was having technical issues With being able to accept a payment. I got on a chat with a XXXX specialist or customer service person And they confirm the payment was sent. Finally hes able to sign up for account and he goes except payment and it says that I canceled itAnd I didnt cancel it so I got back on chat again and was told the payment was canceled and the money will be returned to me. They stated that they wouldnt disclose what reason it was cancelled or why they lied and said i cancelled it. And all of this was within 20 minutes of me making the payment. So I made the payment through other ways. XXXX still pulled the money out of my account even though they they cancelled it. The payment cleared the bank and came out so because I had given money elsewhere to XXXX for the payment I was overdrawn in my account now {$170.00}. I got on chat with them again and was very upset I sent them a screenshot of my bank statement to show them the transactions and they credited my account for the overdraft fee of {$35.00}. After they gave me the credit that they turned around and froze my account so Im not able to withdrawl the money. Even though the money is then reimbursing me for a fee they cost me they said that I am now permanently deactivated that I violated a user agreement rule. I used XXXX for what XXXX is forAnd thats to send money to friends and family. I used my own bank account and everything is verified, sent them a copy of my ID thats valid and current. That payment they werent supposed to take since they cancelled it but did anyways cleared. Now they say the funds are on hold for 180 days because their loss prevention and fraud places were flagged. Ive yet to get the money back i cant think of a single thing i did to violate a term of condition or how fraud at all is even involved. It sounds like a scam and its discrimination and they stole from me and now said they can not offer any further assistance. Ive yet to recieve the {$400.00} they said they were sorry for and supposedly sent back.

There has been delay after delay, all blamed upon other entities but, it seems to me there has been little or no sense of urgency to resolve until I get a hold of them at the end of the day and then it is too late for that day. I constantly receive promises that are not kept. The loan processor does n't work every day so there are days where no updates are forthcoming. 
In summary, I feel I was led into a loan and once I was vested in it there has been lack of communication and no sense of urgency to fulfill their promises. 
I advise anyone working with this office to be cautious about what they are promised.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","CITYWIDE HOME LOANS A UTAH CORPORATION","UT","840XX","Older American","Consent provided","Web","2016-07-11T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","No","1998862"

XXXX or all of these XXXX ( I believe XXXX XXXX ), submitted my name to the XXXX credit bureaus as a negative "" no payment ''. All XXXX credit bureaus now have a negative report on me. This is completely unfair and incorrect & below is why : Either someone has fraudulently opened a XXXX card in my name or XXXX XXXX/Global Credit has improperly done due diligence. About a year ago, a XXXX credit application was opened in my name. A small charge of {$38.00} was made. And for continual months thereafter - the XXXX bill was sent to another city with a different zip code! Thus, I never received a bill, and thus I never even knew a bill was supposedly due. Fast forward till now. I do a credit report and find out that my credit is tainted, and at all XXXX credit agencies. I call around & find that Global Credit has been in charge of collecting. But, they have NEVER called me, and I have never received a bill! I 've called ( beginning in XX/XX/XXXX ) Global credit and requested original credit application documentation, and continued calling them every XXXX weeks, and as of yesterday XX/XX/2015, they still do NOT have any supporting documentation of the credit card application. They have also confirmed to me that this XXXX bill was sent to a different city & zip code and NEVER to my address. Yet, in spite of never sending any bill to me, to pay, evaluate if mine, etc., they have gone right ahead & posted a negative credit rating XXXX all three credit agencies )! This is outrageous. You see, supposedly this account is registered in my name. But with a different city & zip code. Hence, I 've NEVER received a bill. Yet, they 've had the audacity to file a negative credit report against me - when this account is either a fraud account or has been mistakenly ( on their part ) mailed incorrectly to some other location and city. And the original bill was only {$38.00}! My credit history has been impeccably kept amazingly excellent over the years. I ALWAYS pay my bills and on time. But, I do n't pay for others ' bills, or for bills which I know nothing about, as I never receive a billing notice. Anyway, I 'll not quit till the XXXX credit reporting agencies have all cleared my credit history.

I made one charge to XXXX and paid it off in XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX a charge occurred on this account for {$21.00} which I did not authorize and was unaware of. 
I opted out of paper statements and never received any email communication or statement from them. 
XXXX  charged me a late fee in XXXX and then another late fee in XXXX, XXXX. After checking my credit, I became aware of the charge and late fees in XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to discuss the fraudulent charge and fees and the fact that I never authorized the charge etc., they removed one of the late fees but told me that they could not remove the negative report on my credit. They would not remove the initial unauthorized charge and I paid the amount to keep it from accruing additional fees and interest. The account was reported to the credit bureau as 30 days late several times. I asked them at that time to close the account upon receipt of my payment for the unauthorized charge and late fee. This did not happen. 
Also in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX began charging me a {$2.00} ( "" minimum charge '' ) without my knowledge. I was charged the same fee in XXXX as well. When asked about this fee during my call to them in XXXX, they stated the fee was because I had a XXXX ( XXXX ) balance on the account. I paid those fees in XXXX as well to avoid further problems. 
I was charged again XX/XX/XXXX, and then charged a late fee of {$2.00} and then another "" minimum charge '' of {$2.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, upon finding out that the account was still open and I was being charged fraudulently AGAIN, I paid the {$6.00} to avoid any further issues with my credit, called them to inquire about the charges and fees and requested -- DEMANDED -- AGAIN that they close the account. 
I do not receive paper statements or digital communications from them for this account AT ALL and assumed ( as I should not have ) that the account was closed as requested. 
Upon getting turned down for a credit purchase in XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my credit report and noted that this account WAS NOT CLOSED and was in fact still open and that an ANOTHER fraudulent charge was charged to my account in XX/XX/XXXX and my account had accrued more late fees. 
I have reported in writing to XXXX that the new charge again is unauthorized, and is in fact fraudulent, the account should have been closed. They responded today, XX/XX/XXXX, that they JUST NOW closed the account and refuse to look into the unauthorized charge and will not refund the late fee. 
I have several store cards through XXXX  and have impeccable credit with them, I have paid on time and have not had issues with any card or service like I have with this card. 
This account has not only ruined my credit but has caused me to pay fees that I do not owe just to keep from ruining my credit further. They have not communicated with me properly, refused to close the account as requested, refused to properly review the account upon the report of unauthorized charges and finally have reported inappropriately to the credit bureaus. 
I am now afraid that requesting to close this account with the unauthorized charge outstanding is going to cause additional harm to my credit.

The letter was not marked as important on the outside of the envelope, or anything else that would indicate that it contains crucial information. Additionally, I have chosen to receive all of my account correspondence via email, so all important information should be received via email, and I have NOT received an email regarding this topic. 

The letter goes on to say that as of XX/XX/XXXX ( just 8 days after the letter was received ), my account is being transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX and that my online account information on mygreatlakes.org will no longer be available. I have not received any communication from the new servicer regarding payment due dates, or any other communication to confirm the legitimacy and accuracy of this solitary letter. 

This strikes me as incredibly poor business practice, and a set up that could lead to missed payments, or payments sent to the old servicer ( especially in the era of automatic payments being set up ). 

It seems that for information of this importance, a minimum of 1 month should be required for communication ( especially, as my XXXX searches have taught me, that XXXX acquired Great Lakes in XX/XX/XXXX of this year, so clearly they have had more than 2 weeks of notice to inform me ). This is clearly poor customer service by both Great Lakes ( only 2 weeks notice from the date that the letter was sent ), and from XXXX ( no communication with me at all ).

This is the first time I was not able to make my payment on the due date in the life of my loan. We arranged for a payment on the XXXX which I made online. They acknowledged the payment and so I moved on thinking it was taken care of. On XXXX XXXX I received an email stating my payment had not been received due to insufficient funds. When I went back to see what had happened I discovered the online transfer from my credit union to Wells Fargo had pulled from savings instead of checking which was were the funds were. I was able to make XXXX payments in XXXX but am now struggling to get out from behind the eight ball each month. I had also had been approved for a refinance with XXXX which will clear all my debt and make it possible to stay current with my mortgage from here on. However, the inadvertent late payment was reported to the credit bureaus and resulted in my refinance being cancelled. XXXX stated they would reinstate the loan file if I could get Wells Fargo to provide a letter stating they would reverse the report to the credit bureaus. I followed the steps which Wells Fargo gave me to write in to request a reversal of the late payment report and faxed all of my documentation to them on the XXXX. I spoke with their review department today ( XXXX ) and they confirmed they had received the documentation and would have answer back to me next week. However, I was told that unless they found that an error had been made by Wells Fargo it would likely be denied. 
The ripple effect of that decision would result in me having to sell my home to save further damage to my credit with no guarantees I will be able to qualify for a loan to get into a new home. 
I am writing to see if there is n't a rule, policy, or precedent which would allow Wells Fargo to reverse the report for late payment and keep this from cascading further.

When I called the number the person refused time and time again not give her name or company or what the call was even about, she just keep badgering me on my Name address, SS # etc and would divulge nothing till I did so.

I did not get an itemized bill all I received was a one page letter saying the debt was verified. It also had 2 amounts one for {$42.00} ( the actual Debt ) plus a 40 % collection fee of {$16.00}. I have paid the full amount including the fee, however she called my ex wife several times after I said don't due to issues with her being my exwife and to be honest she has gone back to her maiden name so not sure how they got that number at all. I asked her several times not to call her and she did anyway. I also think the collection fee is unfair it isn't interest its obviously a fee they just decided to add for no good reason.

"2017-08-22T00:00:00.000","Mortgage","Conventional home mortgage","Trouble during payment process",,"My complaint is with Nationstar now known as Mr. Cooper. I asked them to do an in house appraisal ( a cheaper version of a full appraisal ) so that I could have my PMI insurance removed. XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX came out to my home at the request from Nationstar ( Mr. Cooper ) on XX/XX/XXXX.  He took pictures and walked the house including the outside. When the valuation came back at {$480000.00} I was disappointed especially considering my neighbors house across the street just sold for {$510000.00} and a few weeks later my other neighbors house sold for about {$530000.00}. Note : our neighborhood is only about 5 years old ( my home is just over 4 years old ) so our homes are newer and very similar. His report was a disaster : Here are the listed issues : 1-The report is a BPO,  not an appraisal. The disclaimer on page 7 of his report clearly states that the report is not an appraisal, and it was completed by a real estate broker, not an appraiser. I understand that we bought an indoor appraisal but what we were told was an appraisal nonetheless not a BPO. Had it been made clear to me when I spoke to the PMI Nationstar customer service rep when ordering the appraisal I would have paid for the full appraisal. 2-The appraiser just made adjustments based on total square footage, not above grade, below grade, and basement finish. This is huge since several of the comparables had unfinished basements. 3-Almost all of the comparables are rambler style homes, why did he not use 2-story properties like the subject property. There are more than enough 2-story properties in the area ( See attached comps ).

4-Fireplace count is incorrect, we dont have a fireplace, however we do have a radon system installed that we were told would be included on the report when we asked. 5-Garage count is incorrect he states 2 car when his picture of our home clearly shows 3. The agent listed that the subject property and all comparable properties have 2-car-garages, which is incorrect. The subject property and comparable sale # 3, and comparable listings # 1 and # 2 all have 3-car-garages. 6-Our office is missing 7-Six comparable properties were included in the BPO, all six were listed as 2-story properties, only one ( Comparable Sale # 3 ) is actually a 2-story property. The agent actually listed 5 of the properties as 2-story homes when they are clearly ramblers. Note we agree with Comparable Sale # 3 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX UT being used as it is across the street from our house in the same cul-de-sac and thus not included in our comparables provided in our attachment. 8-The BPO shows Comparable listing # 1 and Comparable listing # 3 as having been built in XX/XX/XXXX,  but the MLS listings clearly show them as having been built in XX/XX/XXXX. 9-The bedroom and bathroom count is incorrect. Our home is a 5 bedroom 3 bath not what he shows a 3/2. 10-The appraiser knew we had a finished basement as shown in our pictures provided since he took a picture of the downstairs bathroom but failed to provide any other photos of the basement. 11- The appraiser also asked us where we needed to be with the appraisal which to my understanding is not acceptable in the industry. I filed a formal dispute to the 2 provided email addresses from the Nationstar PMI department reps I spoke to XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was told it would take about 3 weeks to have a response. I called on XX/XX/XXXX since I had n't heard anything and was told my request was n't in their system. I then re-forwarded my request to the EXACT same email addresses used on XX/XX/XXXX and the Nationstar agent said it came through. After waiting several weeks again I called back in XX/XX/XXXX about the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. Only to be told that I could no longer dispute the valuation because apparently the person who did the valuation ( XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX ) no longer worked there. I was told I was still going to have to pay for the valuation and that was the end of it. I asked for a manager and was told that XXXX would call me back, after not hearing from XXXX after a couple of days I called again and asked for another manager I spoke to XXXX on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and he told me it was true I could no longer dispute it and when issues come up with companies like like XXXX XXXX XXXX they no longer use them they are taken out of their system. He then told me THEY would pay for a new valuation and work on not having me not pay for the first one since it has been such a nightmare. I agreed to the new valuation. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by the exact same guy who did the first valuation to come out and do my second one XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called Nationstar immediately and was told another manager would get back to me on FRIDAY 3 days from now after he looked at my file. My wife called after I was told 3 days and she was told another manager would call her back since they were at lunch, hours later still no return phone call. Nationstar/Mr. Cooper has a very interesting phone system when you call in. Every time you call in you go to a different state and when you say the name of the last person you spoke to they do n't know who that is even if it is a manager because they are in a different state and they ca n't transfer you to that person. So you have to start all over EVERY time you call in. No accountability on anyone 's part once they are off the phone with you. It feels to me as though they will do whatever they can to make sure you ca n't remove the PMI insurance.",,"NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE","UT","840XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-08-22T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2647816"

Due to some discrepancies between what the agent said, and what I saw on my credit report, I requested a call back to be scheduled for next week so I would have time to investigate the debt with the original creditor. The agent from Bonneville Collections warned that they would not schedule a call back, but rather that I would need to call back in myself because the account was going to be sent to their legal department today or tomorrow due to the length that they have had the account, and so calling back in a week would be too late to do anything. This threat of legal action infringes on my rights. Additionally, the agent would not give detailed information regarding the debt beyond the name of the original creditor and the total balance. 

In summary : My net impression of the conversation with Bonneville Collections was that I had an outstanding debt which was sold to them. They wanted a payment plan to be set at the time of the call. or else it was going to be sent to their legal department either the day of the call, or the day after, with no time alloted to investigate the debt discrepancies. They are threatening legal action on a debt I disagree with due to details on my credit report and would not provide information on their end to help me to verify the debt. I refuse to blindly pay a debt after discussing vague details on XXXX phone call, and certainly do not wish to have legal action threatened to manipulate me into doing so.",,"Bonneville Billing and Collections","UT","846XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2016-12-15T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","Yes","2252246"

Fast forward to XXXX/XXXX/16 I received a credit report alert telling me i had a new negative loan on my account. Checked it and it was them. They had added it to my credit report without my social security. I do n't understand how they can do that but it was there. 
I called them and spoke to a XXXX XXXX who is in charge of the account # XXXX. After she rudely asked me for my information and I gave her my SS she proceeded to tell me that it was not me and she could not give me any more information on how it was added to my credit. She said that I could dispute it with the credit company but that she was not able to do anything about it. 
I called her yesterday to see if anything had changed and left a message, so i called her again today XXXX/XXXX/16 and now she told me that i have to submit a fax with my credit report, my SS card, my drivers license, and all this other information, and that there investigating team would look at it and get back to me in possibly 2 weeks.

I have a XXXX award. I am marriedwith XXXX Children. I will try to summarize to the best of my ability what has happenedwith my financial situation, my family, my home, and me since XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXXI was laid off from my place of employment at XXXX XXXX XXXX due to companycutbacks and was unemployed for approximately 4 months and when re-employed wasonly making about XXXX of my previous salary. I have since received a better job but stillhave not reached the income I was making previous to XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I was forcedto file bankruptcy due to my distressed financial situation. Bank of America neveroffered me any help, assistance, or options to keep my home. Throughout thishardship I kept in contact with my mortgage company Bank of America to try to workout different options to keep my property or at least avoid foreclosure and possiblywork towards a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a short sale. The only option they everoffered was a forbearance to reinstate which would make my payments higher to payback the arrearages. Since I knew I could not keep my home because Bank of Americawould not work with me, I was forced to move out. I did keep the property in goodcondition and even winterized it before I left. In the end Bank of America foreclosed onmy property and used up all of the VA funds backing my VA loan so at this point I canno longer use the benefit of a VA loan that I have earned as a veteran. I have gonethrough the VA to find out that I am eligible for a VA loan at this time but no longerhave the money backing it unless Bank of America pays it back. My options forpurchasing a home in the future are limited unless Bank of America at least refundswhat they took from my VA loan coverage. This would at least allow me to me ahomeowner again. I most recently spoke to my congressman, attorney general andfiled a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and have still had noresolution. Bank of America claims they offered me these solutions I asked for becausethey sent a letter to the address I was no longer at. On any phone calls I made to themthey would not give me any of the options in this letter. I feel I have been hurtfinancially and to top it all off I actually recently qualified for a home loan ( which was ata higher payment because I could not get a VA loan ) and even made an offer on theperfect home for my family but was told in the end I could not get the loan becauseBank of America held onto the home and additional year after I filed bankruptcy. I amjust trying to get my life back on track and this whole Bank of America issue keepslooming over my head. Bank of America or Countrywide do not stand by the noticesthey sent out. I specifically called for all three options of Loan Modification, Short Saleor Deed in Lieu well before the foreclosure sale date to save my home or try toliquidate the property with more value in it at an earlier date. Bank of America'srepresentatives specifically told me that a Short sale or Deed in Lieu were not anoption per their pooling and servicing agreement. Because they did nothing but offerme a repayment plan that would increase my monthly payments while I wasunemployed they lead me to believe my only options were to file bankruptcy and that Icould not keep my home. I was not given options many of their other home ownershave been given and if this is investigated further it will be proven that what I amasking for is very minimal compared to other claims their company has had to pay out.

Pursuant to the Agreement, a borrower benefit of a reduction in interest rate, after XXXX on-time payments should be in place. 
In or about XXXX XXXX, AES began servicing this loan, inheriting the account from a prior servicer. In or about XXXX XXXX, I received notification of this change, and a form to initiate automatic payments from my checking account to AES.

Nonetheless, I filled out the AES form and conveyed it to AES immediately upon receipt. 
Despite this conveyance, AES wrongfully stated that my XXXX XXXX payment was not made in a timely fashion. As a result, I was deemed permanently ineligible for my borrower benefit of a reduced interest rate. 
As mentioned, every payment ever made on this account has been made pursuant to automated ACH payment. If AES deemed any payment "" late, '' such lateness was due solely to AES 's own negligence, breaches, or other wrongful acts. I did not learn about AES 's wrongful breach until XXXX XXXX, at which point I complained to AES and informed it of the facts of the situation.

I repeated asked them to confirm this on a recorded call and they insisted this was true, in order to collect commissions on those fees. I had found, however, documentation from the  Student Federal Aid  website stating otherwise.   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   #  XXXX   Quoted  below :  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  : What is the current policy for collection fees and rehabilitation?   - Does the balance in a rehabilitation agreement include collection fees and, if so, what is the formula for adding fees to that balance/how are they calculated?   - Does the loan holder take a portion of the rehabilitation payment for collection fees? If so, how much?   - Are fees capitalized in the balance after a successful rehabilitation? If so, how much?      XXXX  : This response applies to Department-held loans ( both  FFEL and Direct Loans ). If the borrower is assigned to a PCA, collection fees are charged against each of the nine qualifying payments ; approximately 20 % of each payment would apply to collection fees, with the rest applying to interest and/or principa l. Once full eligibility for rehabilitation has been achieved, only the principal and interest balance of the loan is transferred to a non-default servicer. From that point forward, no further collection fees are charged unless/until the borrower re-defaults on the loan. In the event of re-default, collection fees are charged according to the same rules as if the loan were a first-time default. Collection fees are not capitalized in the rehabilitation process. Collection fees are only capitalized if a borrower consolidates the defaulted loans.    [   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ] Thi s collection agency is teaching their representatives to lie to borrowers to collect larger fee amounts when it clearly states here the federal rules which govern loan rehabilitation fees. You can hea r three recor ded conversations on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   around roughly  XXXX  MST confirming these facts.   I would like to enter loan rehabilitation without paying any fees to this deceitful agency, including the standard 20 % through the  nine  monthly loan rehabilitation payments, because their representatives repeatedly lied. Additionally, I think an investigation in to ECMC 's tr aining practices should be conducted because I bet their representatives regularly lie to borrowers to collect larger fees and commissions. Finally, I think th e two r epresentatives ought to be fined and given unpaid leave for a period of 60 days.

XXXX= {$140.00}. Without the fee 's I would have almost {$4.00} extra. they tried telling me because I was negative in my account on XX/XX/XXXX, but I was n't. I was negative on XX/XX/XXXX for about half hour. they say if the negative balance is paid before end of the day we wont get a overdraft fee. well fast forward to about an hour and out of no where i 'm getting XXXX overdraft fee 's for things that have already been "" completed transaction '' with a positive balance after. it amazes me that they can just go in and make us pay an overdraft fee for things that are not even pending and have been paid with money to spare. they tried telling me it was negative but can not prove it to me. not one in the print out they gave me does it show that my account was ever negative.

"2018-04-09T00:00:00.000","Mortgage","Conventional home mortgage","Trouble during payment process",,"I have been trying, without success, since XX/XX/XXXX, to remove the PMI from our mortgage loan. Ditech has acted unprofessionally and has mishandled every effort to remove the PMI in the manner I was told to go about having it removed. In my own ( amateur ) investigation of Ditech, I believe that they have dealt dishonestly with me and with others trying to remove the PMI from their account. A more thorough investigation will reveal, I believe, plenty of evidence that they are falsifying home values using their appraisers and are also not removing the PMI off once the loan is qualified for it in a timely manner. It is also incredibly frustrating to wait on hold for an hour or more just to talk to someone on their customer service line. And even when you DO reach somebody, you will get a different answer every time you ask about the policy. I worked in XXXX XXXX XXXX for many years, so it is excruciatingly painful to see such horrible customer service. Although they have given me false information that has caused a lot of problems, they will never admit blame in any way and have done NOTHING to try to pacify me or apologize. 

Here is a timeline of events/calls/information for my case : XX/XX/XXXX : My loan had recently been sold to Ditech and I called regarding cancellation of the PMI. My former servicing company had given me the run around when I had tried to cancel through them. First they told me to get my own appraisal. Next they told me I had to go through them to get an appraisal ordered and the cost would be {$350.00}. Next they told me it would be {$450.00}. Then they told me that once I paid {$450.00} to them, they had up to 6 months to schedule the appraisal and an additional 6 months to apply the PMI cancellation. I was relieved when Ditech told me that I could get my own appraisal and that it would be applied fairly soon ( on a first come first served basis, but likely no more than 60 days from the time they received my appraisal proving the appropriate LTV ). When I was told to get my own appraisal, I really questioned this after all the runaround and misinformation with my previous loan servicer. The agent put me on hold to verify with his supervisor that I could get my own appraisal and send it in. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I hired an appraiser and paid him {$350.00} ( invoice1 attached showing payment in this amount ). The house value went from original purchase price value of {$230000.00} to {$330000.00}. This is more than the appropriate LTV to have the PMI cancelled. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Ditech called me to let me know that my appraisal had been denied because it was more than 90 days old at the time it was received. I hung up the phone in tears. Money was tight and {$350.00} was too much to spend all in vain! I talked to my husband who asked me to have the appraisal redone. We needed to get the PMI removed. Note : I am fairly certain that I faxed the report in about a month earlier than Ditech claims to have received it. It was, however, over 90 days past the date of the appraisal. It was NOT 120 days past the date of the appraisal as Ditech claims in a later email. The fax copy should have time stamped the date on there and in my own memory it was sometime in XXXX and not in XXXX. I do not have any documentation of the day I sent it in by fax. At no time during the phone call was it mentioned that I could no longer schedule my own appraisal. Also, I searched online and NOWHERE did it say that appraisals must be received within 90 days to be valid. I was never told this before sending in my appraisal. I obtained a second appraisal with full confidence that it would be valid if received within 90 days of being done. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Paid for and obtained a second appraisal ( value increased to {$370000.00} from the XXXX value of {$330000.00} -- clearly the values are increasing with time and the appropriate LTV amounts are being met. ) I mailed the appraisal in to Ditech within 2 days of receiving it so as not to have any problems. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Ditech shows record that they rejected the second appraisal because they no longer accept appraisals scheduled by the homeowner and it needs to go through Ditech. ***I was NEVER notified by email, phone or mail that the second appraisal had been rejected. The only reason I found this out is because I realized in XX/XX/XXXX that I had never heard anything and that the PMI was still being charged to my account every month. 

XX/XX/XXXX : When I realized that the PMI was still being charged I called Ditech. I held for around an hour before getting somebody from customer service who has zero authority to help me with an exception. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was placed on hold for about 10 full minutes. The guy came back and told me that no supervisors were available to talk to me but he would have his supervisor call me back. This was on a Friday and it was around XXXX XXXX. I asked WHEN I would hear back and was told I should hear back by Monday end of day. I never heard anything back by Monday end of day. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I talked to customer service agent XXXX in detail about everything. XXXX has been with Ditech since the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX and NEVER at any time to her knowledge has Ditech allowed homeowners to obtain their own appraisal. It has ALWAYS been a policy to go through Ditech to schedule the appraisal ( they use THEIR appraisers ). I was never told this. The guy I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX who put me on hold to VERIFY WITH A SUPERVISOR that I could get my own appraisal gave me incorrect information. XXXX put through a request for the supervisor of that guy to listen to the call dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a text alert AND an email ( doc1 attached ) during my church services informing me that we have completed our research and have resolved the issue ( s ). I was never informed what the resolved issues were regarding or what the research showed. I was expecting a call on Monday with more information, but alas, no call ever came ( not a great shock considering Ditechs poor track record for follow up ) The many mistakes have cost me {$650.00} in appraisals and {$98.00} a month in PMI payments since XXXX ( or even XXXX since I am pretty certain the original appraisal was faxed in the month of XXXX and not in XXXX ). If the appraisal was received in XXXX ( and the fax shows a timestamp ), and nowhere was it ever publicized that my appraisal had to be 90 days or newer, the PMI should have been removed effective XX/XX/XXXX. I have paid {$980.00} in PMI that should not have been collected. And I have paid {$300.00} EXTRA in an appraisal I should not have had to pay for. I request to be CREDITED for one full month of my mortgage payments ( in the amount of {$1200.00} ) and I also request that the PMI payments in the amount of {$98.00} be removed going forward and the PMI be cancelled. Honestly, the amount overpaid is {$1500.00}. My husband has been unemployed for 3 months now. With an honorable mortgage company, I would call in to work something out due to distressful times. But with Ditech, I can not wait on hold for 1 or more hours to talk to them about an issue that they will NOT be compassionate about in any way. I read report after report of hurricane victims complaining on their website that they would not work with them. Most companies gave a 3 month waiver for making any kind of mortgage payments for homes that were totally destroyed under a mortgage loan. Ditech gave a 3 month waiver BUT in the fourth month they charged 4 months worth of payments plus a late fee. This is the kind of company that my mortgage got transferred to. They have no compassion and NO INTEGRITY in the wake of disaster. 

I also want to say that when I finally got a call back from Ditech after several months, I informed them that I was going to be recording the call. I have had TOO MANY instances of being given incorrect information over the phone and I dont trust them to stand by what I am told over the phone. I was told that they would not be able to continue the call if I was recording it. How is that ok??? They record EVERY call I make into them. But they wont give me a copy of the calls to prove that things they say were said on the call WERE NOT. 

Here are some details on each of the documents that are attached to this complaint : Doc1 - the mysterious notification that the research has been concluded and the issues have been resolved ( how were the issues resolved and what was the outcome more specifically of the research??? ) Doc2page1 -- Copy of the email complaint I sent in on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX ( later they document that they received my complaint on XX/XX/XXXX??? ) Doc2page2 -- email complaint continued ( PDF files attached showing both invoices for the appraisals I got and also a copy of the appraisals showing rising values on both ) Doc2page3 -- this page shows the automated response I got -- it will be 3-5 business days to respond ( that is utterly ridiculous!! When I was in customer service, my ABSOLUTE MAX to respond to a complaint was 24 hours. My personal response average was 3 hours but I have always given amazing customer service and I was totally dismayed to be given a 3-5 business day response time expectation. ) The response I got in 3 business days told me they were looking into my request and that I would hear back by US mail. No time frame was given for when I would hear back. 
Doc2page4 -- On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX ( a full month after sending my original complaint ) I sent an email response indicating that I STILL had heard nothing by US mail. This was also the day that I finally got a phone call only to be told they would not continue it if I was going to record the call. I asked them to respond within 48 hours with a copy of the most recent mail sent. I had posted a complaint on the Ditech XXXX page where they told me that they had sent a response by mail on XX/XX/XXXX but nothing was received. I dont believe they mailed anything on XX/XX/XXXX. It wouldnt take more than a week to receive. 

Doc3 -- a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX but not received until XXXX ( is this the one they claim they sent out on the XX/XX/XXXX?? ). This is the correspondence that erroneously claims they received my complaint on XX/XX/XXXX ( the one I emailed on XX/XX/XXXX above ). They just told me they were researching it. They told me to expect a written response within 30 days from the date they received my correspondence. I guess they mean 30 days from when they said they received it ( the complaint that was timestamped on XX/XX/XXXX but not received somehow until XX/XX/XXXX?? ) Doc4 -- another copy of the response to my original emailed complaint telling me I will hear back in 3-5 business days. Yikes!!! 

Doc5page1 -- they sent a sharefile ( that would expire that very day ) with a response to my complaints. I cant access the sharefile any longer, but thankfully they DID send a copy of the response several weeks later by US mail. 
Doc5page2 -- shows my rebuttal of their response/rejection. They provided a lot of erroneous information in their rejection letter. Just to reiterate, I was NEVER at any time told on XX/XX/XXXX that the appraisal had to be 90 days old or less at time of receipt to be valid. They insist that they listened to the call and I was told that but they REFUSE to share a copy of said monitored call with me claiming it is proprietary and not shared with public. 
Doc5page3 -- continued Doc5page4 -- continued Doc6 -- I sent in an email through a form on their site sometime around XX/XX/XXXX asking them to send me a copy of the mail they had supposedly mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a response telling me that they can not help me since the information I provided can not be verified. LOL Doc7 -- a copy of the sharefile mailed out and received the middle of XXXX rejecting all of my requests to cancel the PMI. On XX/XX/XXXX you contacted our office to discuss the process for removal of private mortgage insurance ( PMI ). The Ditech agent advised you that you can submit your own appraisal but the appraisal could not be more than 90 days old. The agent NEVER at any time told me this. And they will not allow me to listen to the call. They are falsifying information about what was discussed on the call. In order to qualify for PMI removal, you must authorize Ditech to order the appraisal and charge the cost to your account or you can reduce your principal balance, or wait until the PMI will automatically terminate in XX/XX/XXXX I have been told that my PMI would automatically terminate in 12 months ( by reaching the LTV balance needed ). This was in XXXX. But now they are saying XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately I dont have evidence of what was told to me over the phone ( story of my life with Ditech ) and I am pretty sure they will be unable to find the evidence if they listen to the call ( so crazy how that works ) but I would be willing to testify under oath that I was told it would be approximately 12 months and the PMI would automatically be cancelled. So they change their story a lot. 

Doc8 -- I received yet another letter in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX in which I was told that Ditech is in the process of reviewing my written request. Our research has not concluded. The purpose of this letter is to notify you of our ongoing investigation in an effort to provide you with a resolution. This after they sent the final decision and rejection. I think that letting them know that they had falsified information discussed on the call and that I was going to take further action got them a little worried. My guess is I will NEVER hear anything back to say that my PMI is being cancelled. I have done MORE than my due diligence to cancel the PMI. I have spent countless hours and dollars getting them to do what they should do by cancelling the PMI. 

Doc9 -- email confirmation of payment on my XXXX payment including the PMI payment in the amount of {$98.00}. In doc3 it says, We have also ceased all collection activities on your account until our investigation is complete. I have NEVER been delinquent in any of my payments. But as you can see they are still collecting funds including the disputed PMI payments. This seems dishonest. 

Doc10 -- copy of a monthly statement showing full amount owed for my mortgage payments. 

I have also included copies of complaints from XXXX, the ditech XXXX page, and online that I feel show that Ditech is dealing dishonestly in the case of mortgage insurance cancellations. A more detailed investigation will reveal discrepancies between values of homes by Ditechs appraisers and another appraiser and I believe will show a pattern of fraud where PMI is concerned on the part of Ditech. 

There was also a record of a complaint posted on the XXXX  page by XXXX XXXX. She paid to have an appraisal scheduled by Ditech in XX/XX/XXXX. The value came in at a low price, too low to remove the PMI. Two weeks later she refinanced through a different lender and the appraisal came back {$28000.00} higher than ditechs. I believe that Ditech has appraisers in their pocket who are falsifying values so that Ditech doesnt have to cancel the PMI. I also believe that they are not terminating the PMI in a timely manner when the LTV reaches the right point ( as insinuated by the changing dates of when my PMI will be eligible to come off the loan ) Ditech is so hard to get through to when there is a problem and so slow to come to a decision. I think they are just hoping I will drop it. But I will not. If I dont get the resolution I desire, I will continue to make a stink and take further action as needed.","Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers","Ditech Financial LLC","UT","840XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","2018-04-09T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2869522"

The dealer sold the loan to Santander co. I was not told by the dealer who held the loan. I did not receive loan papers, payment invoices, etc from anyone. I repeatedly asked the dealer who told me in XX/XX/XXXX that it loan still had not been sold but I would be notified when it was. In early XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from Santander that I was late on the loan despite never being notified of the fact that they held the note or where to send payment. I talked on the phone with Santander on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that I was late for XX/XX/XXXX 's payment. I explained I had never been notified. They told me I had to make a payment and would have a second payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested my due date be moved to the XX/XX/XXXX of each month because I could not make 2 payments that close together. they agreed if I paid a payment during the phone call. They told me the payment was {$640.00}. I paid it.They did not change the due date. When I did not make the payment on the XX/XX/XXXX they charged me a second late fee and reported me late to credit companies. They called me and told me I was late and my due date was still the XX/XX/XXXX. I made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX and they charged me another late fee on XX/XX/XXXX. They also raised my payment from {$640.00} to {$710.00} and did not notify me. I have made 2 payments in XX/XX/XXXX to get on track with there changes. I asked them to remove the late report and being behind on payments from the credit agencies because they never told me they held the note. I did not know who or when to pay. Once notified I paid what they asked and when. They changed the amount, continued to assess late fees and incorrectly report. The have so far refused to correct my credit report. They have been dishonest and refuse to help.

HAMPs goal is to offer homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure reduced monthly mortgage payments that are affordable and sustainable over the long-term.
HAMP was designed to help families who are struggling to remain in their homes and show : Documented financial hardship An ability to make their monthly mortgage payments after a modification.
HAMP is a voluntary program that supports servicers efforts to modify mortgages, while protecting taxpayers interests. To protect taxpayers, MHA housing initiatives have payforsuccess incentives. This means that funds are spent only when transactions are completed and only as long as those contracts remain in place. Therefore, funds will be disbursed over many years. 
Starting in the summer of XXXX, the scope of the program will expand to help even more families in need. 
HAMP works by encouraging participating mortgage servicers to modify mortgages so struggling homeowners can have lower monthly payments and avoid foreclosure. It has specific eligibility requirements for homeowners and includes strict guidelines for servicers. The program includes incentives for homeowners, servicers, and investors to encourage successful mortgage modifications.
Families in this program typically reduce their monthly payments by a median of more than {$530.00} each month. But the programs impact goes even further. HAMP has also encouraged private lenders to modify mortgages at no expense to taxpayers. 
When the housing crisis began, the mortgage industry was ill-equipped to respond adequately. Mortgage servicers had insufficient resources to address the needs of a market that was reeling from increasing foreclosures. In addition, their servicing expertise and infrastructure was limited to overseeing collections and foreclosing on those who failed to pay. They did not have the systems, staffing, operational capacity, or incentives to engage with homeowners on a large scale and offer meaningful relief from unaffordable mortgages. 
Before HAMP, there was no standard approach among loan servicers or investors about how to help homeowners who wanted to keep making payments, but needed mortgage assistance.
By setting standards for what constitutes a sustainable modification across the mortgage industry, HAMP has helped to make private loan modifications more affordable for homeowners. In fact, thanks in part to HAMP, the proportion of private loan modifications that reduce monthly payments for homeowners has more than doubled. Together, public and private efforts have helped nearly 5 million Americans get  mortgage assistance to prevent avoidable foreclosures. 
MHA includes comprehensive compliance reviews to ensure that servicers fairly evaluate homeowners for assistance and follow program guidelines. Treasury requires participating servicers to take specific actions to improve their servicing processes to more effectively assist struggling homeowners. While more progress needs to be made, servicers are focusing attention on the areas identified through regular compliance and program reviews.

I recently completed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy. Everyone on this planet that I owed money to was listed on that bankruptcy. No entity was left out. 

Shortly after the discharge of my bankruptcy I requested a credit report. Mysteriously, a collection that was never on my account prior to the discharge suddenly showed up as a collection AFTER the bankruptcy. The collection, IS NOT MINE. The collection shows as a joint account from XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX. First and foremost, I have NEVER had a joint account with anyone. Second, I currently have a XXXX account which I just barely opened last year and it is, IN GOOD STANDING. 

First thing I did was contact the collection agency, SEVERAL TIMES. The agency is, Creditor Information RECEIVABLES PERFORMANCE XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX When I contacted the collection agency and finally talked to someone it was not the person I was supposed to talk to. They refused to transfer me to anyone else. Would not even transfer me to a supervisor. They just kept telling me that they could not remove it because I did not have an account number. I explained I did not have an account number because IT IS NOT MY ACCOUNT. I also explained about the bankruptcy and that if it was my account it would have been listed prior to discharge. She refused to hear me out and said she could not help me without an account number. 

I contacted and emailed their accounts "" escalations '' department and left at least 10 messages with my name and phone number and nature of my call. I have yet to receive a call back OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. Below is a list of contacts I have utilized : Telephone Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Escalations Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Email : XXXX Shortly after informing them on a voicemail that this was not my account and that I had a bankruptcy of which this account was not a part of, mysteriously somehow without a supposed "" account number : '' they were able to find the account and report to XXXX  that it was in my bankruptcy. WHICH IT IS NOT. ( I have a lawyer and he can verify this information. ) When I saw that on my report I exploded. I tried reporting both XXXX and the collection company to the FTC. So far I have not heard back. I sent an email to every executive I could find in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX and both XXXX and XXXX do not have this collection on my reports and have responded to my request to make sure it does not get on the report. 

A XXXX executive responded by giving me a letter specifically stating that my account is in good standing and I do not have a collections. I sent this to everyone and still no help or changes have been made to my report. 

The people who have never responded are XXXX, except to deny my dispute and they have made it impossible for me to access my account information on XXXX  to keep disputing it. They keep saying my password is wrong and when i call them they say they fixed it but they never do and I have not had access for over a month now because they seem to be blocking my ability to get into the account. They tell me to call them and I do and I do everything they ask and I still cant get access. I have done that at least 3 times or more. 

I have never heard from Receivables Performance Management. If they cant help me without an account number how are they able to change the false information they are reporting to XXXX and falsely claim that the collection is on my bankruptcy? IT IS NOT!!!!!!! BECAUSE IT IS NOT MY ACCOUNT. I did not include it in my bankruptcy because IT IS NOT MINE!!!!! To me this suggests their is illegal practices being coordinated inside both companies. 

I promise you I spend most days crying about the entire ordeal. I am a XXXX Veteran with XXXX and this has sent me into XXXX, made me XXXX and cause me to exacerbate my XXXX. I do not know how much more I can take. I have taken several months to do my bankruptcy as perfectly as possible.

I had already visited other "" for-profit '' schools in the area including  XXXX  's  XXXX  and University  XXXX   XXXX .   While at  XXXX   XXXX , I was asked to sign some documents which they stated would only : a ) check my  credit score and b )  my eligibility to obtain federal & private loans. Despite asking about grant eligibility,  XXXX  never gave me any information or help in searching, finding, or applying for grants. I was asked to return the next day when the information requested would arrive and to my surprise, I was told that I had already accepted the loans. I was not aware that I was accepting responsibility for, or taking on, any actual loans but despite telling them I had come in looking for information they told me I had already signed to take the loans and begin enrolling into the school. At this point, under pressure from both recruiters and financial aid employees I believed the only option was to accept enrollment and the loans.   At this point, I was not aware of private student loans or how they function. This was not explained to me until I was half-way through th e 2-year progr am. In this situation, I was called into financial aid due to an issue with my funding. It was explained to me that federal student loans can only cover 90 % of my tuition and I would need to find another source of funding. I did n't have the money they were requesting me so they told me I am officially dropped out of the program and my loans are going to come due. Financial Aid then told me I  may have a longshot chance at getting funding from a bank and gave me a list of a couple of them that I can apply for. I recognized one of th e companies (  XXXX  -- a company I worked for previously but was a   XXXX   XXXX   ) so I chose that one.  XXXX  had me sign some more documents but still told me I could not attend until the extra funding came in. To recap, I was told my student loans are going to be due and that I owed  XXXX  for extra tuition plus. At this point my parent helped me by making monthly payments to  XXXX   XXXX  directly of {$200.00} for 2 months when  XXXX  called me and said that the rest of the funding is going to be covered by private student loans. I still did not receive any details about these loans until after I graduated.  <P/> Throughout my entire experience with  XXXX   XXXX  I was never explained how federal student loans work, how FAFSA works, or how private student loans work. I have no idea what I paid for or why I had to make those payments and this does n't even cover the lies I was told about wages and employment I would be eligible for post-graduation. In short, I was promised  XXXX -  XXXX   in  XXXX   XXXX  &  XXXX  work but the only jobs I could get ( and the only jobs  XXXX  would refer me to ) were entry-level,   XXXX   XXXX   jobs. I was the only person in those jobs that had a ""  XXXX   XXXX  '' degree.","Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint","First Associates Loan Servicing LLC","UT","841XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-06-02T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2500136"

"2016-12-22T00:00:00.000","Student loan","Non-federal student loan","Dealing with my lender or servicer","Having problems with customer service","Please refer to Case number : XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted this response to ECMC 's response, and I got no response. I called CFPB and was informed that the company does n't get a copy of my response, I have to submit another complaint, with the response. So, here is the response, the original complaint, Case number : XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, is below that. ECMC 's response will be in one of the attachments. 
1. This complaint will not be resolved until there is a settled payment plan. I called the XXXX on ECMC 's response and I entered "" 1 '' for XXXX, and "" XXXX '' to enter my account number, and the system hung up on me. I tried this several times, during business hours. I need a real human to talk to get all the payment options ( especially, "" Settle in Full '' ). Can CFPB assist in getting ECMC to give me payment options, please? 

2. My attorney never received a copy of the Dept of Education letter ( which was n't even on government letterhead ) even though everyone was aware I have an attorney, as he was the one who requested the hearing. Again, the request for hearing is mostly to dispute ECMC 's unscrupulous credit practices dealing with me, the customer, and dispute all of the additional charges which resulted during the time they refused to correspond with my attorney. 

3. I would like to see the similar complaint and response filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) on XX/XX/XXXX, case # XXXX. I do not have access to this. 
4. I have an additional collections company now chasing me for my student loans. Please see attachment from XXXX. Who are these people and why do I have multiple companies chasing me for student loans? They seem to have gotten a payment for an amount similar to what was taken from my Federal Tax refund ( also attached ). 
Original Case number : XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, Complaint : I paid on my student loans consistently from XXXX. I had to stop due to a family crisis and business failure that eventually led me to file bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. The case closed in XX/XX/XXXX and the majority of my debt discharged. I immediately had my attorney contact the third party student loan collector on XX/XX/XXXX. Rather than communicate with my legal counsel, they sent a form for my attorney to fill out authorizing them to talk to him. This is despite the fact, he had an authorization attached to the original letter. He sent the "" Authorization to Disclose '' provided by ECMC. The authorization was lost. ECMC would not even communicate with my attorney for over a year. They denied getting the "" Authorization '' and another was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Once the authorization was finally acknowledged, my attorney requested a hearing, but the hearing request was ignored. My attorney asked for an accounting and for all the documentation held by ECMC. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter explaining that they did not have any information on my prior payment history and the only information they were able to provide was a copy of the original promissory note from XXXX. I still have not received any accounting for all of the payments I made and the net result is I have student loans that exceed the original amount, even though I paid on them for seven years. In addition, I am being penalized for hiring legal counsel, since much of the recent delay has been by ECMC 's lack of communication with my legal counsel and the denial of his request for a hearing. My tax refund for XXXX was seized by ECMC. Their sole objective seemed to be to add the collection costs of 24.34 % on to my student loans. I have no problem paying my obligations, but I 've unnecessarily been placed in default and collections, when simply working with my attorney after my bankruptcy an appropriate repayment plan could have been reached. Now the defaulted loan is impacting my security clearance.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","ECMC Group, Inc.","UT","844XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2016-12-22T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","No","2260595"

I fear that I may lose my home to foreclosure due to Loancare 's negligent business practices. I have spent the last year trying to get Loancare 's agents to work with me, but can not seem to get any results. I am now in foreclosure with a sale date and and need your help. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I purchased my home with FHA financing and for the next 7 years, I made my payments on time and as agreed. The last refinance was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and at the time I made a very comfortable living, but then tragedy struck. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, while working I swerved to miss a deer, my load was top heavy and it caused my XXXX to roll. Following the accident, I was unable to work. After a year of making ends meet, we depleted our savings. Around XXXX of XXXX, I contacted Loancare to tell them about my financial hardship and to let them know my home loan would go into default. They sent me an application to fill out and requested a bunch of financial documentation from me.I put everything together and sent everything they asked for, however, they claim they did n't received it, so I sent it to them again. Then they claimed that things were missing, so I sent everything again. I ended up sending in the same documentation to Loancare three times and then they closed my file. Without letting me know, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Loancare filed a Notice of Default against my property and I was bombarded by marketing from Attorneys and Real Estate Agents. Loancare did n't even have the common courtesy to call and let me know that my file was still incomplete or send me a letter advising the documents they were missing. Once I found out about the notice of default, I called Loancare, but they refused to speak with me and that I had to "" speak with their attorney ''. I contacted their Attorney who told me that I either needed to pay the full default amount or they would take my house away. I asked about payment options, and he TOLD ME TO SPEAK WITH LOANCARE. So I have Loancare telling me to speak with their Attorney and I have their Attorney telling me to speak with Loancare? Clearly, I was on my own. Since Loancare would not speak to me and their attorney wanted the full amount due, I was forced to file for bankruptcy as the only way for certain that I could stop the foreclosure sale. I have been mistreated by everyone. You always hear about how the banks want to help you avoid foreclosure and there 's "" free '' help to avoid foreclosure. I 've tried getting help both from Loancare and from the non-profit housing agency, and neither of them helped me at all. I have done my own research on my options, and have learned a lot and have determined that I have been severely mistreated by Loancare. Here is what I learned : ( 1 ) FHA has an unemployment program that I was never told about, and was never offered to me. Why? I was struggling and never knew this was an option. ( 2 ) I should have a single point of contact at Loancare. I never got one. Every time I spoke with Loancare I had to speak to a different person. ( 3 ) When the Notice of Default was recorded, they could have still evaluated me for hardship relief. Instead, they told me to talk with their Attorney. ( 4 ) FHA offers several different options to help me keep my home, and Loancare has never told me about nor reviewed my loan for any of them. ( 5 ) Loancare was suppose to evaluate my file and inform me in writing of any outcome. I never received a call, let alone anything in writing. My wife and I are back on our financial feet and can afford our house payment and I struggle to understand how to resolve my crisis and need some help.

They stated it would take up to 30-60 days from the payment processing on XX/XX/XXXX. I called at the XX/XX/XXXX and they now stated that I had to dispute the medical debt through each of the credit bureaus for it to be removed.

This went back and forth XXXX 5 times until XXXX with several conversations of settlement. XXXX was very abrasive and cursed at the XXXX XXXX people trying to settle the case, he would not settle. Somewhere in near the end of XXXX XXXX ( lied, said I never responded to the court ) ) convinced or bought this judge to put a judgement in on me, without my day in court and any arbitration.

XXXX told XXXX XXXX that I no longer had a contract because these carpet baggers had bought this debt so they were no longer responsible for the stipulations of the contract. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX tried again to settle and offered everything I had in the account ( {$11000.00} ) they said no and cursed them out again and said they want it all. In the same month we submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX but XXXX did n't even respond, he ignored XXXX arbitrations attempts. XXXX XXXX I found out they had garnished my pay check at XXXX but also my Utah XXXX tax return was taken.

On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$24000.00} that was to be applied 100 % to principle only. But they did not do that. They applied it to principle ( {$24000.00} ) & interest ( {$34.00} ). This made a complete mess of the loan. We should have 6 or 7 payments of {$440.00} each remaining, the payoff should occur in XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. 

But their mistake caused multiple problems : 1. It changed the due date of my NEXT payment to XX/XX/XXXX! 
2. It changed the amount due for each payment to {$300.00} instead of {$440.00} I have called them 6 times at ( XXXX ) XXXX and I am getting the run around. 

I called first on XX/XX/XXXX as that is when I first noticed the error. I was told it should be fixed in 24 hours. It was not fixed in 24 hours. 
I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was given the runaround again and this time I was told it would take 3-4 business days to reverse the payment and apply 100 % of it to principle. 
I called on XX/XX/XXXX as the problem was still not fixed. At this point I asked for a supervisor who was supposed to escalate it. 
I called on XX/XX/XXXX when I went online and found no changes to my account again. 
I called today, XX/XX/XXXX and was finally given to a supervisor named XXXX who told me that she would take care of it TODAY and call me back. Right now, 4 1/2 hours have elapsed and she has NOT called me back. So I called again and this time I got someone named XXXX. I asked her to transfer me to XXXX. She told me that she didn't know who XXXX was and couldn't do that. And yet, after I told her my next step would be to file this complaint, she had a miraculous restoration of memory and she told me that XXXX must be on a break or out at lunch. ( So she was lying to me in the first place about not knowing who XXXX is or where she was ). XXXX told me she would submit the request AGAIN and it would take ANOTHER 3-4 days. By this time, I'm boiling over and I said, "" You have been telling me that for 9 days! '' So that is where I left it. I am frustrated beyond belief and in the meantime, we continue to accrue interest on the loan that we should not be accruing. 
I have dealt with them before on a short-term loan ( similar circumstances ) and just getting a simple address change done took 8-9 phone calls. They are maddening and should be thoroughly investigated. 
XXXX would like us to recommend them to our friends. Sorry. I can recommend the car itself but I would never, ever recommend XXXX XXXX to anyone.",,"HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA","UT","84043",,"Consent provided","Web","2018-03-02T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2831277"

"2016-10-15T00:00:00.000","Mortgage","VA mortgage","Settlement process and costs",,"Wells Fargo bank is continuing to attach late fees onto my mortgage each month for a single rolling 15 day late payment on an amortizing negative amortization ( the only amortizing "" bi-weekly '' neg am '' loan in the market at the time we got the mortgage, which was over 5 years ago and originally initiated by Wachovia Bank and purchased by Wells Fargo ). This late payment happened more than two years ago. In essence, they are compounding monthly interest on that single rolling late. I already know this is an illegal procedure. In addition, my loan "" note '' calls for a grace period on the mortgage payments which are due and payable every other Friday. According to a report from my employer which is a large national mortgage company, Wells Fargo is recently reporting late payments to other lenders and major credit bureaus that I 'm working with. Our mortgage payments are not late which we can prove because we pay everything electronically. This too is completely illegal and an attempt to hold me in a predatory loan by preventing me from re-financing out of it which is what I 'm attempting to do and will do in spite of this horrible banks shenanigans. Wells Fargo is the most despicable organization on the planet in my opinion and worse than XXXX in my opinion because XXXX at least claims to have a cause that is not tied to "" make money at any cost '' as its sole motivator. Additionally, I would urge anyone in the country with a Wells Fargo mortgage loan to demand a written payment accounting from Wells Fargo and to assess all late payment charges if they have any. 
Update : I went to Wells Fargo Bank and they admitted they were not aware of my loan note requirements. They stated they would stop accruing late charges and would follow the loan note mandates and call me to rectify. This was one week ago and so far, I have not heard from anyone at Wells Fargo that has promised to keep me updated, including the Wells branch loan manager who also promised to e-mail me an update.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","WELLS FARGO & COMPANY","UT","841XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2016-10-15T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","No","2162138"

"2017-08-31T00:00:00.000","Checking or savings account","Checking account","Problem caused by your funds being low","Overdrafts and overdraft fees","On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX XXXX MST I logged into my account to see that there was a new pending charge made that I had not previously been aware of. In response, I immediately transferred {$50.00} into my account from XXXX to ensure that the account did not go over as that and XXXX other transactions were still listed as pending. Wanting to make sure that the transaction had gone through before any overdraft fee had been assigned I logged in the next day at approximately XXXX XXXX MST to check that everything had been covered in time. When I logged in, it showed transactions as still pending, my deposit, no overdraft fee, and a positive balance of {$27.00}. There were no messages stating that the system was undergoing maintenance and that the balance may be inaccurate or that fees from the previous day may have not yet been assigned. My bank does occasionally show such a notice on weekends, so I believed that what I was seeing was accurate as there was nothing to indicate to the contrary. Based on this information, I went about my day and made a purchase with my debit card. However, when I got home and logged into my bank account online at approximately XXXX XXXX MST, all the transactions that had been shown pending in the morning were now suddenly showing as having been completed the day prior and that an overdraft fee had also been assigned the day prior. As a result, the site now showed my balance going into the day as - {$7.00} with another pending transaction. I immediately transferred {$24.00} from my XXXX into the account to attempt to prevent what would now be two additional overdraft fees and called my bank. I at first spoke to a representative that was polite but explained that there was nothing she could do as I had maxed out my overdraft fee refunds with a previous request related to another issue that had been resolved earlier in the year ( as I recall, there had been a large transaction that slightly overdrafted, but they ran several smaller transactions after it that had been made prior to the charge, causing a cascading overdraft effect - had they ran these smaller transactions first, there still would have been a positive balance prior to the larger transaction that slightly overdrafted, apparently in the course of fixing this they locked me out of being taken care of on any other issues for the year ). I responded that I understood but in this particular situation I had been mislead and would not have spent any money had I been provided with the correct information about my account online and would like to speak to a manager. I explained the situation to the manager and that I was unsure of the time I had logged in in the morning to which he suggested XXXX XXXX or so, to which I responded that sounds right. He then informed me that the bank would post the pending deposit but would not show me any transactions that had finished the previous day as the system was in maintenance mode and would not have processed them that early in the morning and implied that it was my fault that I did not know that. The manager was very rude and dismissive in this response to which I said I found that very misleading as a consumer because there was nothing on the website to tell me that was the case. I communicated that if my account could have hidden fees that were n't showing, the website should indicate that to me so that I am not mislead into spending money that is n't there. He then apologized for his tone and began to tell me that I had actually logged in around XXXX XXXX in a very accusatory tone, which I took as him calling me a liar for not being 100 % sure about when I had logged in initially. He then did his best to conjure up a fake apology and inform me that there was still nothing he could do and that their system worked just fine as it is, again implying that I am at fault for not knowing the intricacies of their system 's processing methods - methods that are not described anywhere on their site that I could find. I then asked for information about their arbitration system so that I could deal with this myself as I believed my account was setup under an arbitration clause, to which he responded he did not know what that was or if I was under one. He made no effort to determine whether or not it was the case and only offered to provide me with deposit regulations. Their website also had no information on this as far as I could find. I let him know there was nothing else he could do for me and that I would try to resolve the issue myself. 
////////// In the end, my concern is that my bank provided me with information that I used to make financial decisions that then will likely cost me an additional {$68.00} in fees I must pay to them because of the unique way in which their system processes. I find that the way their website conveys information to consumers that use their system early in the morning - primarily those that have to work very early - deceives its users into spending additional money and thereby paying out additional overdraft fees. In other words, if it is possible that fees had been charged the previous day, I should be able to see them as soon as I see my deposits, or there should at the very least be a notice informing me of the possibility and need for me to check again during business hours. While I now understand how their system works in this respect due to information provided after the fact, I am certain that this targeting of lower income customers and those who choose to keep most of their funds in a separate savings and/or an online account such as XXXX is effecting more than just me. I can provide the call recording upon request. 
////////// The day after I originally wrote this up, the bank did the same thing, showing a positive balance in the morning, but changing it after a certain time - allowing me to attach images showing that there is no indication on the site anywhere to suggest that the balance it showed may be inaccurate.

"2017-07-28T00:00:00.000","Checking or savings account","Checking account","Managing an account","Problem using a debit or ATM card","I ordered a "" free trial '' product that was seen on XXXX XXXX and praised by all of the XXXX. I am leary of these kind of offers but went to check it out. There was a popup or overlay that stated No recurring monthly ordering ''. That was all it took to convince me that this place must be on the up and up. But even with the other trial offers, it was easy to find revealing information about cost if you failed to cancel, etc. There was nothing about this on the site I ordered the free trial from. I paid S & H for {$4.00} and {$5.00}. When I received the product, all that was included in the shipment was a piece of paper that listed the contents. Within 13 days I noticed that my bank had transferred savings to my checking twice, to pay the total of {$170.00} to the company I had received the free trial from. I immediately contacted the seller to dispute the charge and find out what recourse I had. The company was completely unprofessional and basically laughed in my face because there was no refunds. I was so mad I hung up on them. They had the nerve to call me back 3 - 4 times. The order came from California and the phone calls were placed to California. I filed a dispute with my bank and the BBB in XXXX California as that was determined by the BBB locater to be the branch I needed. My bank refunded the charges to my account but said that they needed to investigate. The BBB sent a response to my Complaint within a day telling me that they had transferred my Complaint to New York. I have had 5 responses from this company beginning with I could return the order with my receipt or invoice ; 50 % off and keep the product ; proof that I ordered the product by providing a detailed step-by-step delivery schedule which proves nothing ; to "" [ my name ] did not buy from this company ... [ company name ] and lastly, what name did I use. My bank sent a messsage informing me that they had received proof from the company that proved I had ordered the product and they were closing my dispute. I forwarded the comment that I had not ordered from the company to my bank. The informed me that the matter was final and closed, and that if I wanted to proceed I would have to do so without them. The day after I was informed of bank 's decision, my phone rang. I was at work and no phones! I did pick up my phone as I had just arrived and the call was a large "" Scam Likely. '' Completely caught off guard, I put the phone down while trying to figure out what that was or what had just happened. As soon as I had the chance, I opened phone to get the number of the caller or sender, there was nothing. I am positive that it was the scammer laughing in my face. This would fit with the attitude they had when I had attempted to get this resolved in the first place. Every time I go online and pull up this "" as seen on XXXX XXXX '' ad, there is a different company name. I have XXXX different names just with this transaction. When I first signed up with my bank, I had specifically requested no overdraft protection. Apparently somewhere down the line that has changed. I typically will do my own funds transfer when and if necessary. My bank has blocked my card use several times previously when they did not think it was me using the card. I call them every time and things are resolved. I do not make these types of purchases and if I ever make a purchase of any type on the internet, I will use XXXX or prepaid card so that they can not access my account. Believing this was a free trial, an honest to goodness free trial, with no automatic reordering, and believing what I see or am told, I did not think about this not being a legitimate offer. My bank had my money in hand and without any communication with me about any of this other than my initial dispute, decided that they would honor the charge. I do not have the money to squander on this type of purchase, but thought I would try free trial. I honestly would have considered a purchase down the road had this been on the up and up, because I like to reward honesty. But I signed nothing, I saw nothing and I relied on the information promised or shown about no reordering. I have been scammed, the bank has contributed to that scam. I work in collections and I am not a collector. I needed a job. I do not talk to people the way most every collector does and I listen to their complaints. I have helped consumers get matters resolved and made right. As a result, I also manage to collect a decent amount. I am really disillusioned by my bank making this decision without any communication with me, and believe that everyone trying to conduct a legitimate business must be made aware of the technology and the abiilities of scammers who can produce everything requested or required to help them in their scamming.",,"JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.","UT","841XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-07-28T00:00:00.000","Closed with monetary relief","true","N/A","2588046"

Later this was upheld and the dispute apparently was resolved in XXXX 2015. 

Then there was a mix-up and I was credited with another payment, but that was resoved by action of the bank. But it was followed by another charge and there is absolutely no documentation to support this previously charged item noted and is probably another un-supported charge made by these people identified as XXXX XXXX TX. It just goes to show you that the information contained in the XXXX XXXX, 2015 letter that they felt might slip by your bank. 

I have asked the bank on three subsequent occasions to please reverse this charge that is clearly an error. There has been no response forthcoming from the Bank 's Customer Relations Department other than on the reversed charge, which was on the billing. Instead, they have charged me interest on this XXXX twice and now have charged another fee of {$25.00} for late payment which I have protested and sent back their Sam 's MasterCard for their failure to communicate to me just what is their rationale for charging another fee for the XXXX when they originally had upheld my disputed billing. 

All I got was a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2015 stating that "" ... your credit of {$260.00} was applied to you account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. You can find this credit on a previous billing statement. '' This took care of the double credit but there was no explanation for the other billing XXXX! 

And this has now resulted in the fourth letter regarding this matter because their recent billing included more late charges and another service charge. So, I have had no other option than to cancel this card because of your failure to service the charges made on it particularly to Sam 's Club ; and, I have now considered filing a complaint with the CFPB.",,"SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL","UT","84075","Older American","Consent provided","Web","2015-10-27T00:00:00.000","Closed with monetary relief","true","No","1622482"

She said that I had to wait for the card to come before requesting a balance transfer increase. I then asked why I was hearing a "" beeping '' in the phone, and she stated that I was being recorded. I then said that I will turn on my recording device on my phone ( as is legal under Utah state law ). The woman became even more abusive saying I had no right to record, yet she had a right to record me. The woman hung up the phone. 

I called back yet again and waited 15 minutes to be transferred to a US call center. The agent there said that as soon as the card arrived, it would take "" a few minutes '' to do the balance transfer limit increase. I waited for 13 days with no card arriving. Finally, I demanded a new card be overnighted, to which it was. I finally called back and gave the "" supervisor ' my card number, who then told me it would take an additional 2 weeks to get an approval back on the balance transfer request. 

I said that this kind of behavior is atrocious and how dare they treat clients this way. I asked to have the balance request cancelled. I then received an email stating my card and account was closed, an action not authorized or approved by me.",,"AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY","UT","840XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2018-07-03T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2952907"

In regards to this particular account, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, we filed a Chapter XXXX  Individual Debtor 's Statement of Intention on XX/XX/XXXX. We stated that the property would be retained in the bankruptcy and the debt was to be reaffirmed. We claimed the property as exempt. We had never been late or delinquent on this account. Neither us nor our lawyer received any documents from XXXX XXXX   after this submission. In XX/XX/XXXX we visited out mortgage broker to start the process of qualifying for another home loan, as we are ready to purchase another home and sell this current home we are in. It was discovered on our credit reports that XXXX XXXX reported to the major credit bureaus that our mortgage account had been "" Included in or Discharged through bankruptcy ''. XXXX XXXXXXXX  quit reporting on this account in XX/XX/XXXX In each phone call to XXXX XXXX  we have been told different information. In one call the customer service representative told us that they do not send out reaffirmation letters. In another one told us they sent us one, that the letter would have gone to our attorney 's office. When I asked for proof that this had been sent they told me they only send them regular mail via the US Post Office and could not provide that information. Which I found odd since any letter that they ever sent us was also available online to view. I then contacted my attorney 's office who filed bankruptcy for us. Their office told me that EVERY reaffirmation letter they receive from ANY creditor is sent either XXXX  or XXXX  or USPS with delivery confirmation/signature required so proof of delivery is available. I have filed multiple disputes with XXXX and Equifax with no changes made. I have sent them all the supporting documents including proof of all payments made, Statement of Intent, a letter from our attorney 's office, and proof that we are current on our payment to XXXX XXXX. How can this account be being reported as closed when we are clearly making payments to them? Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by XXXX   that the documentation I provided was not enough for them to make any changes. When I asked what was needed the agent told me they don't have a specific list of what documentation would change the status because XXXX XXXX is their client and they have to go off of what they are reporting. I feel the last 2 months of trying to dispute this have been a waste. What good are these credit reporting bureaus if they work for the companies that are reporting to them? Where is the consumer protection in this when there are disputes. This error on XXXX XXXX part is severely impacting our ability to get another mortgage. OnXX/XX/XXXX I submitted all the same documentation to XXXX XXXX and was suppose to have an answer from them by now about how to resolve this incorrect reporting/not reporting to the credit bureaus. I am including all documentation sent to XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus as well as documentation of all payments made to XXXX XXXX.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.","UT","847XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2018-04-02T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2859594"

I assume this was done to cross the threshold of justifying legal action. I informed Capitol One several months ago that I am getting paperwork completed with a debt consolidation company. In that conversation I asked for the contact information of where to send the paperwork to but I was told someone would contact me, in which they never did.

I was hospitalized while attending XXXX XXXX and received money from XXXX XXXX. I had to be flown out for XXXX XXXX where my insurance would cover and the recovery took roughly about 2 months due to complications. <P/>Years later, I started attending college again. I consolidated ALL of my loans through NAVIENT and I have been paying my school out of pocket since XX/XX/XXXX. When I pulled my GPA up and consistently passed my courses and made payments for school each semester, I wanted to finally be able to use a student grant to pay for my classes. I was told that Navient was holding me back from being able to receive a grant. That is when I contacted Navient in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that they had sent my account to the XXXX XXXX XXXX for non-payment. I asked why it was sent there if I had been enrolled in classes at LEAST 1 semester was part time per year and I have been paying them out of pocket. They told me there was nothing they could do and I would have to just pay the XXXX XXXX XXXX {$5000.00} in full. I asked about my other loan accounts and was told those were NOT sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I asked why 1 account was sent when all of them were supposed to be consolidated together, I was not given an answer. I was told I had to pay {$5000.00} in full to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and 3 consistent months of {$150.00} payments to Navient for my other accounts and THEN they would allow the school to provide me with a grant. I told them, I have a 10 year old car that is falling apart, paying for school out of pocket, unwed, unassisted with housing/food/family/etc., and there was NO way they could help me with at least the payment amounts? They said no. I 'm still paying for school because I refuse to give up my education in hopes of a more successful future. I am 1-2 semesters away from my XXXX XXXX degree ( depending on how much I can afford to spend per semester ), and then I will persue my XXXX XXXX degree. My credit has been tanked solely due to student loans and medical. I feel like I am drowning debt and have to sacrifice my credit just to keep myself afloat with the essentials in life and 1 or 2 classes per semester.
<P/>
Navient was supposed to consolidate ALL of my loans together. I do n't understand how 1 of my accounts was sent to the XXXX XXXX XXXX when they were ALL supposed to be the same account and kept together. I feel robbed and lied to. Now I have a ruined credit score and am flat broke scraping by. I called XX/XX/XXXX to set up my payments for 3 months of summer so that I could get grants and take more classes in XX/XX/XXXX so I could just get my XXXX 's taken care of. I was told that I still had to pay {$5000.00} to my account at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in full and that my monthly payments to qualify for grants was now 6 months! I just can not get a straight answer. With all of the scams going around, I am so confused. I am willing to pay my debts, but I do n't know who to pay or how much is the accurate amount because things keep changing with the deadlines they give me, the monthly charges they provide me, and their refusal to email me anything in writing. It 's almost better just to totally butcher my credit and spend my money on school like I 'm doing now rather than give it to a con artist and still not be able to receive my education.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.","UT","847XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-07-07T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2568462"

It was our intention to use the bulk of the funds from the sale of our old home once received to reduce the principal balance on our new one. Wanting to keep some funds in reserve, and knowing we would soon make a major principal reduction, we only put 10 % down on our new home, and accepted that we might have to pay PMI for a few months. Our closing documents indicated that we could eliminate PMI by reducing our LTV below 80 %. Our old home sold, and on XX/XX/2016 we made a principal reduction payment on our current mortgage in the sum of {$110000.00}, which by BB & T 's own calculation brings our LTV to 60.3 %, and on that date in conversation with BB & T 's mortgage service center personnel, requested PMI be removed. That request was rejected, and we were told that a history of 24 months of timely payments on the mortgage was required under BB & T "" policy '', irrespective of the fact that we were now significantly below 80 % LTV. Following that verbal conversation, we received a letter ( unsigned ) from BB & T dated XX/XX/2016, confirming BB & T 's position. 

We have requested the removal of PMI in writing, have made all mortgage payments from the inception of the loan on time, and have reduced the LTV to 60.3 %. The property has not declined in value in the short time since we closed. We believe that BB & T 's refusal to remove PMI from our mortgage, and refund any PMI payments held in reserve, is contrary to the provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, and note that BB & T 's stated policy of requiring 24 months of payments regardless of LTV, is not permitted under the Act, as expressly stated in CFPB Bulletin 2015-03.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BB&T CORPORATION","UT","84103",,"Consent provided","Web","2016-11-21T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","No","2215673"

In addition to my XXXX job I held tree additional jobs-one in XXXX and two outside of XXXX and I was earning around {$75000.00}. When the economy tanked in XXXX two of my, jobs that helped me generate {$26000.00} in income abruptly ended without any warning.
At this point I went to all of my creditors and explained my situation and asked for help. All of my creditors but one were very helpful letting me lower payments for a time, or just pay the principle, alter due dates and so on. My primary mortgage allowed me to make the payment on the last business day of the month which is when I was payed However, XXXX XXXX would not allow me any consideration whatsoever even though I went through their save my home department and communicated my willingness to pay them. I finally said that I could make the payment on the last business day of the month and they said that this was okay so long as I make the payments. So from XXXX until XXXX I made the payments on the last business day of the month.
In late XXXX  because of the home loan interest rates, and my change in jobs as well as a desire to get on a better financial footing I went to a local mortgage broker and applied for a home refinance loan. The day or two after applying for the refinance, the mortgage broker called me to tell me that I needed to have one year worth of no late payments on my second mortgage loan from XXXX XXXX. I was shocked because I had made every payment and had the bank statements to prove it and many of the receipts. The mortgage broker told me I had like 29 late payment reports. I was shocked.
At my local branch I went in and explained my situation and they gave me who to contact and instructed me what to do. So I printed off my checking account balance statements and wrote a letter asking for the XXXX XXXX to change the late reports for certain late reports. By the time I got through this first go around it was now late XXXX. I received an answer and XXXX XXXX told me they reversed 7 payments up to XXXX, which I did not ask for as I had only asked for two late payment reports to be reversed. The two late reports that I asked to be reversed were XXXX and XXXX of XXXX.
When I inquired as to why they would not reverse the payments I asked for, they told me that it was a violation of Federal Law to change their report to the credit recording bureaus. I also found it strange that they reversed seven reports because they were all made on the last business day of the month, and if they can reverse these seven they can reverse the two that I specifically asked to be changed. Furthermore I also inquired after XXXX XXXX as to why on their receipt, which I began to save after the meeting with the mortgage broker, that it says my transaction would be credited to the business on that day and month in which the transaction was made. I asked XXXX XXXX why they reported me being late although their receipt says something different. Their response was that because the payment was made on the XXXX and it should have been on the first the payment was technically late. I then asked why did they tell me that as long as I made the payment I would be okay.
My first mortgage company does not count my payment on the XXXX as being late, but XXXX XXXX does. I do not understand how they can say open thing on their receipt and yet report me for being late when my payment is credited to the day and month I make the payment?","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","Experian Information Solutions Inc.","UT","84003",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-07-29T00:00:00.000","Closed with explanation","true","N/A","2588489"

No response was received from XXXX and during this time we were contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We were in the beginning stages of foreclosure. 
We were contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who said they could do a loan modification for us and get our mortgage payments lowered to approximately {$120000.00} and their company would be able to negotiate a write off of interest and penalties we occurred with XXXX.

We were contacted by XXXX XXXX from CORE, ( XXXX, XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and were asked to send a list of documents ( this email is attached ). We complied with this and sent the information back. 
Prior to our agreement with CORE, our monthly mortgage payment was {$1400.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX we sent a letter to CORE asking the following questions : 1-The payment for the 3 months is higher than my original payment! Is this supposed to be an improvement? 
2-This is an open-ended solution that leaves no clue as to the ongoing arrangement.

3-What is the interest rate for the 3 month payments?

4-What is the interest rate once the 3 months are paid?

5-What is the balance that has been negotiated?

6-What are the ongoing payments once the 3 months are paid? 

This is a copy of COREs response : ANSWERS : 1. It is a solution to save your home. It may not accomplish your wishes but it a solution to take your home out of foreclosure and to start making payments instead Of paying whole delinquency amount at once to reinstate your loan. 
2. 3., & 4. You will know your final terms till the end of you trial payment. You must make all of your trial payments on time before they complete the permanent modification. The terms of any final modification will be reflected in the permanent loan modification that will sent to you once you complete the trial payment plan. ( read pg # 3 & 4 ) 5. You are behind since XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX + foreclosure fees, at the end of your trial payments they will put it back in the loan. 
6. Most of the time the payments stays the same or decrease a couple $ $ but it will be around the same payment or exactly the same.

We have learned that they did not have a location in Utah, they had a Utah address but there was no one who worked in that office. We have tried contacting XXXX XXXX and can not get in touch with him. 
We are now current on our mortgage payments because we had not choice, we couldn't lose our home. Our payment is {$1600.00} per month which is what it was after the month trial period but over {$200.00} more than what is was before we paid CORE.

When I was in the process of applying for a mortgage, I learned of a delinquent "" BBY/CBNA '' account on my credit report. Upon researching the account, I learned this was a Best Buy Citibank account someone in Georgia had fraudulently opened in XX/XX/XXXX using my identity. In early XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an identity theft report with the FTC, a police report with my local police department, I called and spoke with Citibank 's customer service, I filed disputes with all three Consumer Reporting Agencies, and I placed a fraud alert on my credit report. To their credit, XXXX and XXXX removed the item from my credit report. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, I learned the item still appears on my XXXX credit report, causing my credit score to be 150+ points lower on XXXX than on the other two. I called XXXX and attempted to deal with this issue again. They wanted me to go through the entire dispute process again, sending the police report and FTC report again. I understand that the agent was following company policy, but the redundancy and frustration of having to go through this again is painful and inconvenient. I am uncertain as to whether XXXX never deleted this item after the XXXX dispute process, or whether Citibank attempted to re-report this account. Either way, I am now frustrated by having to deal with this again. If this does not remedy this situation, I will pursue legal action under the FCRA.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","CITIBANK, N.A.","UT","843XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2017-08-02T00:00:00.000","Closed with non-monetary relief","true","N/A","2592322"

On XX/XX/XXXX I tried depositing the check on my Bank of America ( BoA ) account through their mobile app. Over that weekend I stopped having access to my online account Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I called their customer service and after talking to at least 3 different persons I was told that my account was in the process of being closed because I had tried depositing a "" counterfeit check ''. The next day I went to a small BoA office in XXXX, FL to talk to them and explain them that the check was in fact real and that I needed to get this sorted out because I wouldn't start working until at least two more months and I was moving to a different city. There the person was extremely rude and told me that she couldn't do anything and gave me a phone number to call to, right after leaving the office I called and was told that there was nothing that either them or me could do to get the issue sorted out, that their risk department had deemed the check to be a counterfeit and that they were closing my account and reporting me to financial institutions. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a bigger BoA office in XXXX to talk to someone else, there the person called their closure department and informed me that they were holding the money until XX/XX/XXXX, here I asked for an explanation and was told that they were holding the money because it was the first big check that I tried depositing and they wanted to make sure it cleared before making the funds available to me, and that if the check cleared I shouldn't have any issues, but if it didn't they would return the funds to the sender. On XX/XX/XXXX I went back to the BoA office and I was told that the check had bounced ; immediately after I left the office, I called XXXX  and made the accounting department aware of the issue, they told me that this had never happened before and to return the check to them if I still had it and that they would check if there was any problem with it. 

Almost a month later, on XX/XX/XXXX, after an exchange of emails with XXXX   accounting department and being told that the check was in fact in perfect condition and that I shouldn't have had any issues, I went to my new bank to try to deposit the same check I tried depositing in BoA and I was told the check did not have positive pay, which I informed to XXXX  right away. On XX/XX/XXXX, after XXXX accounting department investigated the issue and tried stopping the payment on that check, I learnt that the checked showed that it was cashed on XX/XX/XXXX. After replying to the accounting department that I hadn't receive any money from BoA regarding that check they went into a deeper investigation and on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX   accounting department confirmed that they had received a copy of the endorsed check from their vendor. That same day I called BoA to figure out what had happened, and learnt that they were still holding the money, regardless of the fact that I was told that the check had bounced. After talking to XXXX about this, I went to a BoA office in New York on XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that I needed to get a notarized letter from XXXX  where it stated that the check was valid and for me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX accounting department explained me that the check was a normal paycheck and it wasn't normal procedure to issue those kind of letters, so on XX/XX/XXXX I called BoA again and explained them that I needed another solution and a real explanation on to why the check was deemed a counterfeit and why it was being held ; on this occasion they passed me to a supervisor who did not give me reasons but told me to give him the phone number and name of the person in the accounting department that they needed to contact to validate the check, and to call back in two business days to follow up. On XX/XX/XXXX, after the accounting department told me they hadn't received any phones calls, I called back and asked to talk to a supervisor, who told me that they had tried reaching out without success and again asked me for the phone number and name of the person in XXXX  they needed to contact. On XX/XX/XXXX, after the accounting department told me one more time that they had not received any phone calls, I called BoA and they very rudely told me that if XXXX   wanted the money released they needed to file a claim to Hold Harmless, and that the accounting department should know what this meant. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the accounting department told me that they did not know what that was and that I should call BoA back and file a complaint to the CFPB.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","UT","841XX",,"Consent provided","Web","2018-08-06T00:00:00.000","Closed with monetary relief","true","N/A","2984098"
