Fault with strike-parallel displacement component of slip vector more than 10 times the dip-parallel component of the slip vector at at least one location along the mapped trace of the fault.  15 Dextral strike slip fault. 16 Sinistral strike slip fault.  17 Thrust fault. Fault that dips less than 45 degrees over more than half of the recognized extent of the fault, with a hanging wall displaced from a structurally deeper position relative to footwall rocks.

"This workbook indicates the content requested for features representing active fault traces. Design is focused on faults portrayed as line segments. The content model is based on the GeoSciML thematic view for ShearDisplacementStructure (see https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/bin/view/CGIModel/GeoSciMLThematicViewModel), extended with some convienence properties specific to young fault structures. Active in this context denotes that there is compelling evidence of fault displacement during the Quaternary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"remove Shape/FeatureTrace field. Update Notes to point out that can't create line feature classs from content in spreadsheet--it has to be joined with a GIS feature class that contains the geometry and a foreign key to join with the table here (if that is the chosen approach to data compilation). Recommended compilation approach is to compile data into personal geodatabase feature class, avoiding long text truncation and field name truncation that will be a problem in the shapefile version of the feature class template","Stephen Richard","http://1.2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
