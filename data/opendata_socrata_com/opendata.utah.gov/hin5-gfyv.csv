","The original subsidy package announced in March 1995 was worth $86 million. Micron later asked for more, and the amount was increased to $125 million. The subsidy included $50 million in sales tax exemptions on equipment purchases, with most of the rest consisting of infrastructure assistance. The plan was for Micron to lend the money to the city, which would then repay Micron using the company's own property tax payments. Although the plant was built, Micron delayed production in Lehi until 2007, by which time the plant was being operated by IM Flash Technologies, a joint venture of Micron and Intel.
