"Clean Steam Piping Replacement","CC Health & Hospitals System","Health & Hospital Systems","DESCRIPTION

This project will repair and replace corroded piping and components on the clean steam system at the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County (JSH). 

The Hospital has two separate steam producing systems, heating and clean steam. The central boiler plant, used to generate steam for heat, is a closed system. Condensate is pumped back to the central boiler plant, treated and reused. The central boiler plant feeds the clean steam system. Clean steam is then generated by six independent generators. 

The clean steam condensate lines, components and fittings have been subject to severe corrosion and leaks. Continuous problems and damage include but are not limited to:
* Deterioration of the supply and condensate piping, threaded joints, elbows, steam traps, jacketed kettles, etc.
* Staining and corrosion in Autoclaves and kitchen equipment and staining of sterilized medical equipment and utensil
* Humidifiers leaking into the ductwork and hospital spaces and improperly sized humidifiers
* Clogged steam generator tube bundles

"New RTU/RCDC Project at the DOC","CC Sheriff","Court System & Corrections","PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project will provide a new 283,000 square foot Residential Treatment Unit (RTU) and Reception, Classification, Diagnostic Center (RCDC) at the Department of Corrections.

This new facility will efficiently respond to the demand of increasing numbers of detainee admissions and mental health evaluations and treatment in a secure, contemporary, well-organized intake and state of the art medical screening facility.

The facility will meet current ?Essential Standards? set by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care and the American Correctional Association as required for maintaining accreditation and recommendations by the Department of Justice

The existing RCDC and RTU facilities can no longer accommodate the volume of admissions, screenings and care required. The facilities are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are outdated and detainee movement throughout the process is cumbersome due to lack of space and inefficient work and holding areas. 

The RCDC processes new admissions into the Department of Correction and detainees going to and from court for all six branches of the Circuit Courts of Cook County. The number of detainees processed through the RCDC can average 1,500 individuals on a single busy day.

The RTU provides a range of medical and mental health evaluation and treatment services for individuals within the criminal justice system, from the point of arrest through incarceration to release. New admissions receive medical and psychological screenings upon arrival in the RCDC. The RTU houses detainees who present during pre-screening in the RCDC with mental health concerns and provides residential intermediate care and twenty-four hour crisis and intervention services. The RTU also houses detainees from other divisions in the jail who develop mental health issues during incarceration.

"Stroger Hospital Polymer Epoxy Flooring","CC Health & Hospitals System","Health & Hospital Systems","The existing sheet vinyl flooring is the original flooring finish in the Central Sterile Processing area in  the hospital and has been in use for 9-years, since the hospital opened in 2002. Due to the wear and tear, the sheet vinyl has many tears and splits. Also, the underlayment in some areas has deteriorated. Many areas of the flooring has delaminated and bubbled, this makes it difficult or impossible to repair properly.

In the Central Sterile Processing area, contaminated surgical tools, used instruments and other materials are received throughout the hospital, sterilized and assembled for the re-use in surgeries and other clinical procedures. It is necessary that finishes in the Central Sterile Processing, including flooring, possess qualities to promote cleanliness and enhance infection control.

Based on the hospital's experience with the existing sheet vinyl flooring, we have reached the conclusion that a more durable epoxy flooring in the CSP area is necessary to meet the above objective. The epoxy flooring will be easier to maintain and with a longer expected service life, will be more cost effective long term.",,
