Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/qj89-2j7h",,"2019-09-12T03:39:51.000","2019-09-12T03:39:51.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","11","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2018-01-01T05:00:00Z/2018-01-01T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2018-01-11","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:004, 029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","903cb61b-6c1c-4155-ba25-714b62ce31fe",,,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/mwh3-cyxh",,"2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","44","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2014-09-01T04:00:00Z/2014-09-01T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-065",,,"Accelerating Access, Pending Appointments",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/abhu-hft8",,"2019-09-12T03:41:29.000","2019-09-12T03:41:29.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","34","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2015-08-15T04:00:00Z/2015-08-15T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-422",,,"Accelerating Access, Pending Appointments",

The Registries have undergone a modernization and simplification effort that allows the entry of data via a web interface at <a href=""https://vaww.registries.aac.va.gov/eas/"">https://vaww.registries.aac.va.gov/eas/</a> by staff at the VA medical centers. In compliance with the Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA) this is considered a single system of records with the three registry components i.e. IRR, AOR, GWR with DU that have been integrated into a single Oracle database.  Please see individual Monograph entries for specific details on:  Ionizing Radiation Registry (IRR), Agent Orange Registry (AOR), and the Gulf War Registry (GWR).</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"agent,agent orange,depleted,du,gulf,orange,radiation,registry,uranium,va,veteran,war","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/espt-hpfu",,"2019-09-12T03:46:23.000","2019-09-12T03:46:23.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","290","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1998-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:041",,"VA-VHA-OPH-006","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

The CCR:HIV and CCR:HCV are administrative and clinical databases designed to provide population-based data on VA patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and/or Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Each Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system contains a local CCR where patients who are potentially HIV or HCV infected are identified based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes and/or positive antibody test results. The local HIV or HCV coordinator must review these cases to determine which patients are truly infected and should be added to the local registry. The local CCR provides extensive reporting capabilities to the local HIV and HCV clinicians to monitor their patient population. The local CCR software also extracts data elements from multiple VistA packages and transmits Health Level Seven (HL7) messages to the national database at VA Austin Information Technology Center. The national database is used for monitoring clinical outcomes, assessing resource utilization and quality assurance.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"aids,health,hepatitis c,hep c,hiv,patient,population health,registry,va,veteran,vista","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/bhqz-62fb",,"2019-09-12T03:44:42.000","2019-09-12T03:44:42.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","237","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1992-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:040",,"VA-VHA-OPH-003","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

<p>The National Cardiac Device Surveillance Program Database supports the Eastern Pacemaker Surveillance Center (EPSC) staff in its function of monitoring some 11,000 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients who have implanted pacemakers or cardioverters. The database stores medically useful information about the patients and their pacemaker test results in order to highlight serial changes, which determine whether the pacemaker is still functioning normally, or whether the patient requires further intervention. The EPSC staff performs regular telephonic checkups, in conjunction with less frequent in-hospital clinic checkups, to determine when pacemakers need to be replaced. Patients are scheduled and called by the Pacemaker Surveillance Center, and have their electrocardiogram recorded and analyzed over the phone, using wires attached to their fingers and a VHA-supplied transmitter.  Additionally, some patients are monitored via web-based downloads of their device telemetry.  The Pacemaker Center also provides in-hospital clinic checkups for local Washington DC VHA pacemaker patients. All information obtained during the checkups is recorded in the EPSC Database. The database also contains records of pacemaker patients being monitored by VHA facilities east of the Mississippi and who are not being monitored directly by their respective VA medical centers. The VHA Department of Medical Services encourages local VHA medical centers to refer their patients for pacemaker follow-up monitoring to either the Eastern Surveillance Center or to the counterpart Western Surveillance Center in San Francisco, whichever is geographically appropriate. However, referral is optional. The database also maintains a registry of all VHA patients, living and deceased, who have had pacemakers implanted at, or who have been monitored by, VHA facilities. The EPSC receives information for the registry directly from the medical centers for patients that it does not monitor, totaling over 80,000 as of 2010.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"cardiology,electrocardiogram,heart,pacemaker,patient,va,veteran","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/5yvv-z4vg",,"2019-09-12T03:46:22.000","2019-09-12T03:46:22.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","428","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1982-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:040",,"VA-VHA-PCS-005","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

Legislation has authorized VHA to: submit claims to and recover payments from Veterans' third party health insurance carriers for treatment of non-service-connected conditions; recover co-payments from certain Veterans for treatment of non-service-connected conditions; and recover co-payments for medications from certain Veterans for treatment of non-service-connected conditions.

Individuals who entered active duty after September 10, 2001 may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Individuals can use the Post-9/11 GI Bill after serving 90 days on active duty (excluding entry level and skill training). Only periods of active duty under title 10 will be used to establish eligibility for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. A high school diploma or equivalency certificate is always required for eligibility. Individuals who are eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill – Active Duty (chapter 30), the Montgomery GI Bill – Selected Reserve (chapter 1606), or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) will have to make an irrevocable election to relinquish eligibility under one of those benefit programs to establish eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The dependent children of a person who died in the line of duty while serving as a member of the Armed Forces may be eligible to use benefits under the Fry Scholarship provision of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The spouse and/or child(ren) of a veteran or service member may be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill if the veteran or service member transfers entitlement to those dependents. Eligibility to transfer entitlement to dependents is determined by the Department of Defense. This is not a complete list of eligibility requirements.

A Veteran who meets the wartime service requirements is potential eligible if he/she is: • permanently and totally disabled for reasons not necessarily due to service, • age 65 or older, or • is presumed to be totally and permanently disabled for pension purposes because: o he/she is a patient in a nursing home for long-term care due to a disability, or o being disabled, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security (SS) for purposes of any benefits administered by the Commissioner, such as SS disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income. Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance. A Veteran meets wartime service requirements if he/she served: • a total of 90 days or more during one or more periods of war; • 90 or more consecutive days that began or ended during a period of war; or • for any length of time during a period of war if he/she was discharged or released for a service-connected disability. Veterans entering service after September 7, 1980, must also meet the minimum active duty requirement of 24 months of continuous service or the full period to which the Veteran was called to active duty.

VTK was used for many years at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers to track and manage the hours of service contributed by volunteers and volunteer organizations. Consistency of data between sites was a problem and the process of compiling national VTK reports was slow and costly. Many steps were involved because national data was only consolidated once a month and it was usually out of sync. Improved data collection and reporting is now available since users interact directly with a centralized national database. Rehosted VSS uses .NET technology that replaced data transmissions between sites and the Austin Information Technology Center to produce the consolidated national reports. Direct access to data provides instantaneous updates and up-to-the-minute reporting for all users.

"ryij-m6n4","VA Access Audit & Wait Times Fact Sheet: VISN 2","<p>On Wednesday, May 21, 2014, VA launched the Accelerating Access to Care Initiative, a nation-wide program to ensure timely access to care. As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/jnu4-ebnw",,"2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","38","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2015-06-01T04:00:00Z/2015-06-01T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-108",,,"Accelerating Access, Pending Appointments",

The RDIS contains data collected from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) on all VA research projects. It stores information on VAMC investigators, project budget allocations and expenditures, initial project abstracts, progress reports and research space. VA Medical Centers collect and submit the data using an application called electronic Project Management and Information System (ePROMISE). That data is submitted to Veterans Affairs Central Office and becomes a component of RDIS. ePROMISE collects data from over 150 VA facilities (including 75 VAMCs). VA funded, non-VA funded and non-funded research proposals are reviewed and must be approved by the Research and Development (R&amp;D) Committee and relevant R&amp;D Subcommittees (Human Studies, Animal Use, and/or Biosafety) at each VAMC. Basic information on research projects approved by the VAMC Research and Development committee is transmitted to the RDIS, which tracks the life cycle of these projects.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"animal,budget,development,human,investigator,project,research,scientist,va,veteran","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/qj2m-5y96",,"2019-09-12T03:57:53.000","2019-09-12T03:57:53.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","931","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1993-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:048",,"VA-VHA-ORD-001","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/hmdn-kfgy",,"2019-09-12T03:41:29.000","2019-09-12T03:41:29.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","62","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2015-09-01T04:00:00Z/2015-09-01T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-423",,,"Accelerating Access",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

"jksy-jd4d","Electronic Signature (eSig)","<p>Beginning with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 (GPEA), the Federal government has encouraged the use of electronic / digital signatures to enable electronic transactions with agencies, while still providing a means for proof of user consent and non-repudiation. To support this capability, some means of reliable user identity management must exist. Currently, Veterans have to physically print, sign, and mail various documents that, in turn, need to be processed by VA. This process creates a huge inconvenience on the part of the veteran and a financial burden on VA. eSig enables veterans and their surrogates to digitally sign forms that require a high level of verification that the user signing the document is a legitimate and authorized user. In addition, eSig provides a mechanism for VA applications to verify the authenticity of user documents and data integrity on user forms. This capability is enabled by the eSig service. The eSig service signing process includes the following steps: 1. Form Signing Attestation: The user affirms their intent to electronically sign the document and understands re-authentication is part of that process. 2. Re-Authentication: The user must refresh their authentication by repeating the authentication process. 3. Form Signing: The form and the identity of the user are presented to the eSig service, where they are digitally bound and secured. 4. Form Storage: The signed form must be stored for later validation. In this process, the application is entirely responsible for steps 1, 2, and 4. In step 3, the application must use the eSig web service to request signing of the document. The following table lists the detailed functions offered by the eSig service.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,identity,security","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/jksy-jd4d",,"2019-09-12T03:38:19.000","2019-09-12T03:38:19.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","182","0",,,"jeff.podolec@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs",,"Jeff Podolec",,"jeff.podolec@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2018-02-23",,,,"non-public","029:40",,,,,"Office of Information and Technology","029:000",,"f710f309-f11c-450c-ac67-a77ec0e57a66","Protected by Privacy Act and/or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act",,,

This table displays the count and percent, by county, of Veterans who are farmers and/or dairymen comparative for the entire state's population of Veteran farmers or dairymen in California for 2015. The data was created from our administrative database U.S. Veterans Eligibility Trends and Statistics (USVETS), for the recent event Apps for Ag Hackathon.  


The U.S. Veterans Eligibility Trends and Statistics (USVETS) is the single integrated dataset of Veteran demographic and socioeconomic data. It provides the most comprehensive picture of the Veteran population possible to support statistical, trend and longitudinal analysis. USVETS has both a static dataset, represents a single authoritative record of all living and deceased Veterans, and fiscal year datasets, represents a snapshot of a Veteran for each fiscal year. USVETS consists mainly of data sources from the Veterans Benefit Administration, the Veterans Health Administration, the Department of Defense’s Defense Manpower Data Center, and other data sources including commercial data sources. This dataset contains information about individual Veterans including demographics, details of military service, VA benefit usage, and more. The dataset contains one record per Veteran. It includes all living and deceased Veterans. USVETS data includes Veterans residing in states, US territories and foreign countries. VA uses this database to conduct statistical analytics, predictive modeling, and other data reporting. USVETS includes the software, hardware, and the associated processes that produce various VA work products and related files for Veteran analytics.","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","dataset",,"rural veterans,veterans farmer","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/dph5-xt4w","https://www.datahub.va.gov/resource/dph5-xt4w.json","2019-09-16T21:31:51.000","2019-09-17T00:05:51.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","152","5247","58","5","tamara.lee@va.gov",,,,,,,,"Department of Veteran Affairs",,"Tamara Lee",,"tamara.lee@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",,,,,"public","029:00",,,,,"Veterans Benefits Administration","029:086",,,,,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.

Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/53ux-z4cd",,"2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","39","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2015-04-01T04:00:00Z/2015-04-01T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-102",,,"Accelerating Access, Pending Appointments",

"nhsm-uahe","Traumatic Brain Injury Registry (TBI)","<p>As the number of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients has grown, so has the need to track and monitor care to meet the lifelong needs of these veterans.  In March 2007, a Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) OIF/OEF TBI Screening Reminder was released.  This is a first-line screening tool to identify potential TBI patients.  Additional information about veterans who have been identified as possible TBI patients by the initial Screening Reminder is collected through a Comprehensive TBI evaluation.  Reminder results, in the form of Health Factors, Comprehensive TBI evaluation data, and Comprehensive TBI Follow-up results of individual Veterans will be sent to a national database.  This data will be aggregated in order to provide relevant responses to key stakeholders, such as members of Congress, to monitor the quality of care and to implement system improvements. In addition, tracking applications will be used to collect data on TBI patient appointments.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"brain,enduring,freedom,injury,iraqi,oef,oif,operation,registry,tbi,traumatic,va,veteran","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/nhsm-uahe",,"2019-09-12T03:59:31.000","2019-09-12T03:59:31.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","282","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2005-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:040",,"VA-VHA-PCS-013","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

"x6z5-25xw","Nuclear Medicine National Headquarter System","<p>The Nuclear Medicine National HQ System database is a series of MS Excel spreadsheets and Access Database Tables by fiscal year. They consist of information from all Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) performing or contracting nuclear medicine services in Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The medical centers are required to complete questionnaires annually (RCS 10-0010-Nuclear Medicine Service Annual Report). The information is then manually entered into the Access Tables, which includes: * Distribution and cost of in-house VA - Contract Physician Services, whether contracted services are made via sharing agreement (with another VA medical facility or other government medical providers) or with private providers. * Workload data for the performance and/or purchase of PET/CT studies. * Organizational structure of services. * Updated changes in key imaging service personnel (chiefs, chief technicians, radiation safety officers). * Workload data on the number and type of studies (scans) performed, including Medicare Relative Value Units (RVUs), also referred to as Weighted Work Units (WWUs). WWUs are a workload measure calculated as the product of a study's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, which consists of total work costs (the cost of physician medical expertise and time), and total practice costs (the costs of running a practice, such as equipment, supplies, salaries, utilities etc). Medicare combines WWUs together with one other parameter to derive RVUs, a workload measure widely used in the health care industry. WWUs allow Nuclear Medicine to account for the complexity of each study in assessing workload, that some studies are more time consuming and require higher levels of expertise. This gives a more accurate picture of workload; productivity etc than using just 'total studies' would yield. * A detailed Full-Time Equivalent Employee (FTEE) grid, and staffing distributions of FTEEs across nuclear medicine services. * Information on Radiation Safety Committees and Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs).

"7ahm-cn5f","National Laboratory Workload and Laboratory Management Index Program","<p>Effective management of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service (P&amp;LMS) laboratories requires indicators capable of demonstrating each individual laboratory's productivity and efficiency. Local sites require the capability to determine in real time, the effects of any procedural or policy changes relating to productivity and efficiency. Data collected by each individual medical center is compiled on a national level at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) for P&amp;LMS Central Office utilization. Each local medical center will have the capability to independently monitor laboratory trends and make appropriate decisions. A detailed view of workload data will be provided to support a variety of management and clinical requirements and needs. Measurements of productivity and efficiency data are capable of providing medical center to medical center comparisons. In addition, workload data is suitable for comparison to private sector facilities that capture laboratory workload based on Current Procedure Terminology (CPT). The National Laboratory Workload &amp; Laboratory Management Index Program has been selected as the efficiency and productivity logic model. The National Laboratory Workload &amp; Laboratory Management Index Program report replaces the Lab Automated Management Information System (AMIS) segment used in the past. Each local site identifies the reportable units based on CPT and VA guidelines. Reportable units are extracted by laboratory software and are transmitted to the AITC. The transmitted data is compiled and stored in the National Laboratory Workload &amp; Laboratory Management Index Program database. This database supports P&amp;LMS Headquarters and Veterans Integrated Service Network director's office.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"cpt,lab,laboratory,pathology,results,va,veteran,workload","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/7ahm-cn5f",,"2019-09-12T03:54:32.000","2019-09-12T03:54:32.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","127","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1996-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:041",,"VA-VHA-PCS-017","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

It provides a single point of access for the clinical user's application and information needs, facilitating faster and more efficient patient care.The CISS framework further establishes a foundation for publishing any type of application, including clinical, non-clinical, HealtheVet, and legacy applications. These plug-in applications, called 'partner systems', can be developed independently and published to the users through the CISS portal. The CISS Program development team uses repeatable Agile development, management and support processes to rapidly develop quality software in 6-month release cycles, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"clinical,framework,ohrs,platform,portal,va,veteran,visn,web","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/3anw-i7mn",,"2019-09-12T03:44:42.000","2019-09-12T03:44:42.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","142","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2009-09-09T04:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:041",,"VA-VHA-OPH-004","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant program helps Veterans with certain service-connected disabilities live independently in a barrier-free environment. SAH grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) construct a suitable home on suitable land either already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, or (2) remodel an existing home if it can be suitably adapted, or (3) acquire a suitably adapted home or reduce the outstanding mortgage on a suitably adapted home already owned by the veteran. b. The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d. SAH and SHA grants may be used up to three times, as long as the aggregate grant amount does not exceed the statutory dollar limitation. TRA grants may only be used once (and count as a grant usage for purposes of the limit of three), and the amount of assistance provided will be subtracted from the veteran's available statutory maximum.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","dataset",,"cfda 64 106","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/h66j-6w57","https://www.datahub.va.gov/resource/h66j-6w57.json","2019-09-16T23:00:52.000","2019-09-16T23:01:21.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","70","5111","205","39","ANNETTE.BROWN2@VA.GOV",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs",,"ANNETTE BROWN",,"ANNETTE.BROWN2@VA.GOV",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2019-03-22",,,,"public","029:25",,,,"bc3a6e1f-3fb0-4fb1-8b07-59efaf92222b","Veterans Benefits Administration","029:003",,,,,"Use of Benefits and Services",

The Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grant program helps veterans with certain service-connected disabilities adapt or purchase a home to accommodate the disability. SHA grants can be used in one of the following ways: (1) adapt an existing home the veteran or a family member already owns in which the veteran lives; (2) adapt a home the veteran or family member intends to purchase in which the veteran will live; (3) help a veteran purchase a home already adapted in which the veteran will live. c. . The Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) program provides adaptation assistance to veterans who are residing, but do not intend to permanently reside, in the a residence owned by a family member. If a veteran is otherwise eligible for SAH or SHA, the assistance is limited. d.

The MVI includes authoritative sources for health identity data and contains over 17 million patient entries populated from all VHA facilities nationwide.  The MVI provides the access point mechanism for linking patient's information to enable an enterprise-wide view of patient information, uniquely identifies all active patients who have been admitted, treated, or registered in any VHA facility, and assigns a unique identifier to the patient.  The MVI correlates a patient's identity across the enterprise, including all VistA systems and external systems, such as Department of Defense (DoD) and the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN).

The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/ia9a-9yj3",,"2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","42","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2015-06-15T04:00:00Z/2015-06-15T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-109",,,"Accelerating Access, Pending Appointments",

VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.

Section 208 of the Electronic Government Act of 2002 (E-Gov Act) requires federal agencies to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) on information technology systems that either (1) collect, maintain, and/or disseminate Personally Identifiable Information (PII); or (2) make substantial changes to existing technology that manages PII.. A PIA is an analysis of how PII is collected, stored, protected, shared, and managed. Its purpose is to demonstrate that the information system owners and/or developers have incorporated privacy protections throughout the lifecycle of the system. Absent a legitimate security or sensitivity concern demonstrated by the agency, the E-Gov Act requires agencies to make PIAs publicly available.The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Privacy, FOIA, and Records Management strive to be the leader among Federal Information Technology (IT) organizations in protecting the privacy of Veterans' personal data. Our goal is to respond to mandates to meet the needs of Veterans, while improving the protection of their personal information.To view a PIA for a particular system, go to the heading labeled 'System Operating with a Current/Valid FY2013 PIA' and select the name of the program/project of interest.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"pia,privacy impact assessment,va","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/nmv6-fzrs",,"2019-09-12T03:56:13.000","2019-09-12T03:56:13.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","147","0",,,"Rita.Grewal@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2012-10-01T04:00:00Z/2013-09-30T04:00:00Z","Rita Grewal","en-US","Rita.Grewal@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"public","029:40",,"R/P1Y",,,"Office of Information and Technology","029:080","https://www.oprm.va.gov/privacy/","VA-OIT-ITIS-22",,,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

These access data updates will be posted at the middle and end of each month at VA.gov. The facility-level data show the current status of VA's: 1) New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) List: The total number of newly enrolled Veterans that have asked for an appointment during the enrollment process.  Out of an abundance of caution, VA reviewed the NEAR data from the past decade to identify any individual who:  has enrolled for care since the inception of enrollment,  indicated they desired an appointment on the enrollment form, and has not yet had a scheduled appointment in the VHA health care system. 2) Electronic Wait List (EWL) Count: The total number of all new patients (those who have not been seen in the specific clinic in the previous 24 months) for whom appointments cannot be scheduled in 90 days or less; and 3) Total Appointments Scheduled: Every appointment scheduled at the facility except surgery and medical procedures.  The term 'pending' has replaced the term 'prospective,' which predicts the availability of scheduled appointments in the future for new Veterans on a given date, and the term 'completed' replaced the term 'retrospective,' which indicates when appointments actually occurred.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,appointment,enrollee,ewl,health,health care,near,va,veteran,wait list,wait time","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/h7hy-dzhe",,"2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","2019-09-12T03:43:05.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","43","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2015-05-01T04:00:00Z/2015-05-01T04:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp",,,"public","029:15","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","R/P2M",,"VA-VHA-OIA-073","Veterans Health Administration","029:041","https://www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp","VA-VHA-OIA-105",,,"Accelerating Access, Pending Appointments",

The primary purpose is to provide HBPC management with case mix, case load, and other performance information. The HBPC information system is referred to as HBC at the VA Austin Information Technology Center and as HBHC at the local level. The HBHC automated a paper-based system of reporting home care episodes. When an admission form is completed, an episode is opened and input into HBHC for a potential home care patient. The patient is evaluated and accepted to or rejected from the program. When a patient leaves the program for any reason an episode is closed and a discharge form completed and input into HBHC. HBHC runs a nightly extract of information within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture. Extractions include information on all Patient Care Encounters (PCEs) with the patient and home visits made by home care providers. Details of which provider(s) made the visit, the date, any diagnosis and any procedures performed are included. Each local application sends its data to the Austin HBC database on a monthly basis. A monthly report is prepared based on this information identifying the active cases at each VAMC. A more detailed quarterly report is produced that includes national comparisons among sites.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"care,case,case mix,encounter,health,home,patient,va,veteran","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/ynhd-fgt2",,"2019-09-12T03:47:59.000","2019-09-12T03:47:59.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","378","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1983-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov","https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-11/pdf/2012-11487.pdf","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:058",,"VA-VHA-PCS-009","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

At Hines, quality assurance procedures are performed on the data and local pharmaceutical names are converted to common names before the information is entered into the Drug Accountability database.

"gb2p-c356","Surgery Risk Assessment (SRA) Database","<p>The Surgery Risk Assessment (SRA) database is part of the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP). This database contains assessments of selected surgical operations performed at Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). Addition to the SRA database requires that the surgery is Major (as defined by the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes assigned to the surgery), it must not be cardiac related, and it may not be concurrent with another surgery. Frequently performed other types of surgeries may also be excluded. Nurse reviewers at VAMCs gather the information from surgical data located in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment. Information is also collected from pre-and post-operative charts and from interviews with patients. This information is entered into VistA and transmitted daily by a batch process to the Hines Office of Information &amp; Technology (OI&amp;T) Field Office. While the database has been in operation since 1995, the system only contains data for the current fiscal year. The data from previous fiscal years is archived if later retrieval is needed. Valid transmissions are sent to the VASQIP office at Denver for analysis. Information from non-assessed surgeries is transmitted from the VAMCs to the Hines OI Field Office monthly. This is also passed along to VASQIP at Denver. The users of this database include the VASQIP Executive Board.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"assessment,improvement,operative,patient,quality,surgery,surgical,va,vasqip,veteran","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/gb2p-c356",,"2019-09-12T03:57:58.000","2019-09-12T03:57:58.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","190","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","1991-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:040",,"VA-VHA-SS-001","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",

A Veteran who meets the wartime service requirements is potential eligible if he/she is: • permanently and totally disabled for reasons not necessarily due to service, • age 65 or older, or • is presumed to be totally and permanently disabled for pension purposes because: o he/she is a patient in a nursing home for long-term care due to a disability, or o being disabled, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security (SS) for purposes of any benefits administered by the Commissioner, such as SS disability benefits or Supplemental Security Income. Income restrictions are prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 1521. Pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reasonable they use the estate for maintenance.

"ftpi-epf7","Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)","<p>The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is increasingly dependent upon data.  Most of its employees generate and use vast amounts of data on a daily basis.  To improve our capacity for data analysis while providing the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients, VHA, working with the VA Office of Information and Technology, implemented a health data warehouse.  Central to this plan is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.  The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006, a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW's content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.  CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.  The Regional Data Warehouses and the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Data Warehouses share content from CDW and allow for greater reporting flexibility at the local level throughout the VHA organization.</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"domain,health,sql,va,veteran,visn,vista,warehouse","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/ftpi-epf7",,"2019-09-12T03:46:19.000","2019-09-12T03:46:19.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","3164","0",,,"vhaopendata@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs","2011-01-01T05:00:00Z/2014-12-31T05:00:00Z","VHA Open Data","en-US","vhaopendata@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2017-07-26",,,,"non-public","029:15",,,,,"Veterans Health Administration","029:041",,"VA-VHA-OIA-006","Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protected health information.",,"Basic Statistics, Use, and Operational Data",
"bdus-iu2h","Provisioning (Prov)","<p>User provisioning is the process of associating a digital identity with one or more resource access accounts, which may serve as records for user data and permissions. This may include the creation, modification, deletion, suspension, or restoration of such accounts and also synchronizing user data. Managing user accounts locally creates redundancy in collecting and managing user information. This may lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies with user data that is stored in authoritative sources, and this may also create security vulnerabilities by maintaining accounts for terminated users. By leveraging Provisioning, VA applications are able to centrally manage user information, attributes, roles, and accounts using data from authoritative identity sources. Once a manually intensive and disjointed process, VAs Provisioning (Prov) service leverages automated and centralized workflows to enhance security and bolster efficiency. As a result, application administrators, who previously had to manually manage user administration, now have services available to automate the process. Provisioning assigns the Security Identifier (SecID) as a unique user identifier for integrated applications to use for user authorization and audit. SecID is a unique ID assigned to a user when they are added to the Provisioning system via an on-boarding event. SecID, once assigned, remains the same even if the user status with VA changes over time (i.e., a Veteran becomes a contractor and then later becomes an employee). SecID is the identifier used to correlate Provisioning records to MVIs integration control number (ICN), which is the unique person identifier. Provisioning automates the on-boarding and off-boarding flows. Applications leveraging Provisioning gain an added benefit of automated account removal (deprovisioning) during off-boarding. The following table lists the detailed functions offered by the Provisioning service. Additionally, the Provisioning service includes a Role Engineering and Compliance Tool (RECT) that can help applications:  Conduct Role Analysis: Provides the ability to analyze current roles and permissions to rapidly build and deploy an enterprise role model  Certify User Roles: Provides the ability to have access privileges reviewed and managed by designated reviewers</p>","VA OIT Open Data","chkg-q76v","published","public","approved","official","href",,"access,identity,security","https://www.datahub.va.gov/d/bdus-iu2h",,"2019-09-12T03:38:19.000","2019-09-12T03:38:19.000","www.datahub.va.gov","false","133","0",,,"jeff.podolec@va.gov",,,,,,,"true","Department of Veterans Affairs",,"Jeff Podolec",,"jeff.podolec@va.gov",,"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","2018-02-23",,,,"non-public","029:40",,,,,"Office of Information and Technology","029:000",,"b0dc51dc-9676-4ecc-9964-361f3e2874c9","Protected by Privacy Act and/or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act",,,

"jd5n-mhg8","VA Access Audit & Wait Times Fact Sheet: VISN 1","<p>On Wednesday, May 21, 2014, VA launched the Accelerating Access to Care Initiative, a nation-wide program to ensure timely access to care. As directed by President Obama, VHA has identified Veterans across the system experiencing waits that do not meet Veterans expectations for timeliness. VA has begun contacting and scheduling all Veterans who are waiting for care in VA clinics or arranging for care in the community, while simultaneously addressing the underlying issues that impede Veterans’ access.The nationwide Access Audit covered a total of 731 separate points of access, and involved over 3,772 interviews of clinical and administrative staff involved in the scheduling process at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), large Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) serving at least 10,000 Veterans and a sampling of smaller clinics.
