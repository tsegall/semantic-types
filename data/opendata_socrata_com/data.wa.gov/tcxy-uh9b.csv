2. Demonstrate significant benefit to one or more listed salmon populations and/or salmon populations that benefit Treaty rights.
3. Require only funding for implementation (i.e. no other barriers with respect to authorizing environment, land ownership or project implementation exist) and be consistent with lead entity priorities and/or the 4YWP.
4. Begin implementation during the 2017-2019 biennium.  Implementation is defined as beginning work on one of the eligible project types above.
5. Be approved through the lead entity SRFB review process in 2016.

Additional prerequisites for specific project types include the following:
1. Restoration projects: conceptual and preliminary design must be complete, final design must be complete or anticipated to be complete within the first six months of the award, and permit applications must be started. Project construction must commence within one year of contract award or the next available fish window.

The mission of the ESRP is to restore the natural processes that create and sustain the Puget Sound nearshore ecosystem.  We seek exemplary projects of regional importance that provides substantial and cost effective nearshore ecosystem restoration or protection of ecosystem functions, goods, and services.  10% of funding goes towards projects that advance learning about cutting-edge ecosystem restoration tactics and strategies for the purpose of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of future restoration.  All our work is centered on the scientific principles and ecosystem restoration strategies developed by the decades-long regional nearshore scientific investigation during the feasibility stage of the Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project (PSNERP).","ESRP funds projects designed to protect and restore the ecosystem processes that shape and maintain nearshore structure resulting in self-sustaining improvements in ecosystem functions, goods, and services. The broad restoration objectives  used by ESRP include:
1. Restore the size and quality of large river delta estuaries and the nearshore processes deltas support.
2. Restore the number and quality of coastal embayments.
3. Restore the size and quality of beaches and bluffs.
4. Increase understanding of natural process restoration in order to improve effectiveness of program actions.

The most competitive ESRP proposals will be those that employ management measures that can most fully restore the source of degradation of these natural processes or that are focused on protection of intact areas which supply critical physical processes necessary for a sustainable nearshore ecosystem.
