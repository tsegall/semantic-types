The reported emissions are preliminary and have not been fully verified by Ecology. This information is subject to change.

Certain large facilities and transportation fuel suppliers are required to report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to Ecology beginning with the 2012 emissions year. Owners or operators of the following are required to report:
• Facilities that emit at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) of greenhouse gases per year in Washington.
• Suppliers of liquid motor vehicle fuel, special fuel, or aircraft fuel that supply products equivalent to at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year in Washington.

Sources are grouped by sectors. Most sectors focus on each facility’s onsite emissions. The transportation fuel supplier sector describes emissions associated with the complete combustion or oxidation of fuels supplied by transportation fuel suppliers under the Washington Department of Licensing Fuel Tax Program.

This dataset does not include all of Washington’s emissions. See the Washington State Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (https://ecology.wa.gov/Air-Climate/Climate-change/Climate-change-the-environment/Science) for statewide emissions totals.

The WQI ranges from 1 (poor quality) to 100 (good quality). The WQI summary does not include non-standard elements like metals. For temperature, pH, oxygen, and fecal coliform bacteria, the WQI is based on criteria in Washington’s Water Quality Standards, WAC 173-201A. For nutrient and sediment measures where standards are not specific, results are based on expected conditions in a given region. Multiple constituents are combined and results aggregated over time to produce a single score for each station and each year. All current long-term Ecology monitoring stations with at least 5 years data are included.  Most stations are located near the mouths of major streams.  These stations integrate upstream water quality and capture large basin-scale trends. However, status and trends at these locations may not reflect status or trends in any particular sub-basin. Scores for individual parameters are presented as Oxygen (Oxy) , pH, temperature (TEMP), total suspended sediment (TSS), turbidity(Turb), nitrogen(TPN), and phosphorus(TP).","571","2014-04-25T23:30:00.000Z","2014-04-25T23:36:00.000Z",,"water quality index,2013 river and stream water quality monitoirng data,ecology","1953","Markus.Von Prause@ecy.wa.gov","mvon461@ecy.wa.gov",,"published",,,"Markus Von Prasue, WA State Department of Ecology's River and Stream Monitoring Program",,,,,,,"https://data.wa.gov/resource/dn4d-x42e.json",,,,,"http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/fw_riv/rv_main.html","q8y9-svx9",
