In addition, staff found no evidence proving that the C-1 and F-1 reports were filed late.</p><p>Based on our findings staff has determined that, in this instance, failure to timely file a C-4 repot disclosing a small in-kind contribution from the candidate does not amount to a finding of a violation that warrants further investigation.</p><p>PDC staff is reminding Anthony Keen about the importance of the timely disclosure of all contributions to his campaign, including personal funds and the timely filings of all future PDC reports in accordance with the statutes and rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/108714","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""108714 Keen Anthony Reminder - Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5278/108714%20Keen%20Anthony%20Reminder%20-%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Reminder""}, {""file_name"" : ""108714 Keen Anthony Reminder - Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5278/108714%20Keen%20Anthony%20Reminder%20-%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""108714 Keen Anthony Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5278/108714%20Keen%20Anthony%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""108714 Keen Anthony Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5278/108714%20Keen%20Anthony%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2022-07-28T16:32:24.000"

As a result, the campaign did not have the normal, in-person communications structure that would have provided me with a better opportunity to ensure full and timely disclosure by the campaign team, especially during the rigorous reporting deadlines in the three weeks before the Primary.”</p><p>Staff noted Mr. Vaska was seeking election to a high-profile office, and the typical campaign practices and procedures a Statewide candidate would engage in, including the communication and interactions with consultants, vendors and Campaign Officers and Treasurers were impacted due to Covid-19.&nbsp; The late-disclosed orders placed were for a statewide mailing and digital campaign that was largely conducted remotely.&nbsp; In addition, no evidence was found by staff that the Campaign exceeded contribution limits for the 2020 election or spent 2020 general election contributions on primary election activities.</p><p>However, pursuant to WAC 390-37-060(1)(d), the PDC issued a formal written warning to the Mike Vaska for AG Campaign concerning the failure to timely disclose orders placed with Sermo Digital on both the 21-Day and 7-Day Pre-Primary C-4 reports as required by RCW 42.17A.240.&nbsp; The PDC dismissed the complaint in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/74473","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""74473 Vaska Mike Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3666/74473%20Vaska%20Mike%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Vaska Mike Complaint Return Letter with Warning Cover Letter (Berg) PDC Case 74473.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3666/Vaska%20Mike%20Complaint%20Return%20Letter%20with%20Warning%20Cover%20Letter%20%28Berg%29%20PDC%20Case%2074473.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""74473 Vaska Mike Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3666/74473%20Vaska%20Mike%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2020-10-12T17:04:12.000"

The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on future Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules. &nbsp;<br><br>Based on this information, the PDC has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1). &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/100065","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""100065 Martinez Dennis Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5020/100065%20Martinez%20Dennis%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Martinez, Dennis Complainant Return Letter (Carterl) PDC Case 100065.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5020/Martinez%2C%20Dennis%20Complainant%20Return%20Letter%20%28Carterl%29%20PDC%20Case%20100065.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}, {""file_name"" : ""Email Responses from Dennis Martinez.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5020/Email%20Responses%20from%20Dennis%20Martinez.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2021-11-15T13:16:20.000"

(EY '19; Oct '19)","RCW 42.17A.320","Case Closed with Reminder",,"<p>The PDC received a complaint alleging that Peter Miller (the “Respondent”) may have violated&nbsp;RCW 42.17A.320 by failing to identify the sponsor on political advertising (e.g. billboard). PDC staff reviewed the allegations; the applicable statutes, rules and reporting requirements; and the response provided by the Respondent to determine whether they support a finding of one or more violations.&nbsp;</p><p>Staff’s review found the following:</p><p>RCW 42.17A.320 requires political advertising to include the sponsor’s name and address.</p><p>During the 2019 election, the Respondent and fellow candidate Malia Hollowell co-sponsored advertising that appeared on a billboard in Maple Valley, Washington. The billboard did not include the names &amp; addresses of the billboard’s sponsors.</p><p>The Respondent is a first-time candidate who said he was unaware of the sponsor identification requirements for political advertising. He indicated his erroneous belief that sponsor identification is not required for advertising that candidates pay for themselves. Upon being notified of the complaint on October 16, 2019, the Respondent immediately took steps to resolve non-compliance by contacting the billboard company the same day and instructing them to reprint the advertising. The revised billboard, including sponsor identification, was posted on October 25, 2019.</p><p>Based on these findings, staff determined that, in this instance, the Respondent’s failure to identify the sponsors of political advertising does not amount to a violation that warrants further investigation. PDC staff reminded the Respondent about the importance of identifying the sponsor’s name and address on political advertising, including billboards. The PDC finds that no further actions is warranted. and has dismissed this matter in accordance with&nbsp;RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/58719","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""58719 Miller Peter Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3288/58719%20Miller%20Peter%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""58719 Miller Peter Complaint 2.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3288/58719%20Miller%20Peter%20Complaint%202.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""58719 Miller Peter Complaint 1.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3288/58719%20Miller%20Peter%20Complaint%201.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""58719 & 58801 Miller Peter Reminder Letter.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3288/58719%20%26%2058801%20Miller%20Peter%20Reminder%20Letter.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2021-04-26T16:53:05.000"

Lewis. The C-4 report also disclosed: (1) two Committee expenditures were made to Hopkins &amp; Sachs, Inc. totaling $16,827.82 for a $10,000 expenditure made on October 25, 2021, listing the description as “Digital Media Ads: Pro M.

Lewis mailer, 12,266 pieces.”</p><p>Staff also reviewed the original and amended C-6 reports that were filed within 21 days of the November 2, 2021 general election. &nbsp;The review found that WA Conservation Voters Action Fund (WCVAF) filed a total of 41 initial and amended C-6 reports between October 14, 2021 through January 10, 2022, disclosing independent expenditures undertaken in support of or opposition to 2021 candidates on the general election ballot and checking either box #1 or box #2 on the C-6 form. &nbsp;The 41 C-6 reports filed by WCVAF included: (1) 18 initial C-6 reports filed between October 14 through November 1, 2021; (2) seven amended C-6 reports filed between October 25-26, 2021; (3) eight amended C-6 reports filed on October 29, 2021; and (4) eight amended C-6 reports filed on January 10, 2022. &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Pender stated in his responses to the PDC that the Committee and WCVAF “would like to work with a Filer Assistance Specialist to amend reports if that is needed to resolve this situation.” &nbsp;He stated that WCVAF “takes seriously its compliance responsibilities as a registered state political action committee, strives to follow all applicable reporting requirements…is diligent about completing its filings in a timely and compliant manner.” &nbsp;He stated that WCVAF believes the C-4 and C-6 reports and amended C-4 and C-6 reports filed by the Committee, complied with requirements found in 42.17A.260(3)(C) and WAC 390-16-037. &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Pender stated that WAC 390-16-037 did not specifically state “anything about identifying the number of items purchased”, but noted the rule listed two examples and only one indicated WCVAF “would only need to provide numbers of printed materials, not for calls or texts.” &nbsp; He stated that for a few of the C-6 reports, WCVAF “reported estimated expenditure amounts and then amended the form when final amounts became available.” &nbsp;He added that the Committee, WCVAF and its officers and staff “strive to stay up to date with the filing and reporting requirements of Washington State campaign finance law, and we attend trainings to continually improve our compliance efforts.” &nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Mr. Pender stated that as part of WCVAF’s “commitment to compliance,” the WCVAF “has taken steps to educate and cross-train all staff regarding political activity reporting, so that if a staff member is out of the office or unavailable for any reason,” the required report will still get timely filed. &nbsp; He stated that WCVAF staff continued to work with staff concerning the limitations of the “Description” field on the C-6 report that limits the filer or user to a 28-character description of the independent expenditure. &nbsp;He stated that when filing the C-6 reports, WCVAF “staff spent several minutes on each form trying to fit in as much descriptive text as possible but were constantly running into that 28-character limit.” &nbsp;PDC staff confirmed the 28-character limit for the expenditure description field of the PDC filing application for electronically filing the C-6 report.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the Committee file an amended 21-Day Pre-General Election, a 7-Day Pre-General Election, and Post-General Election C-4 report in accordance with PDC staff’s request, disclosing the required expenditure description(s), including the sub-vendor breakdowns and expenditure details for the independent expenditures.</p><p>Staff reviewed the C-6 statutes, rules, and reporting requirements in accordance with RCW 42.17A.260, for the C-6 reports that were filed by WCVAF. &nbsp;Staff’s review found that the expenditure descriptions listed in WAC 390-16-037 only applied to the C-4 reporting requirements found in RCW 42.17A.240, and the C-6 report, Box #1 reporting requirements found in RCW 42.17A.255. &nbsp;</p><p>As a continuing political committee participating in the 2021 election cycle and regularly filing C-3 and C-4 reports, the Committee was exempt from filing C-6 reports, box #1 for Independent Expenditures of $100 or more in accordance with RCW 42.17A.255. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the rule concerning how to report “Expenditures by agents and agents’ sub-vendors” found in WAC 390-16-205, only references WAC 390-16-037. &nbsp;WAC 390-16-205 does not mention or refer to RCW 42.17A.260 for reporting independent expenditures within 21 days of an election (Box #2 of the C-6 report). &nbsp;Thus, the independent expenditure descriptions disclosed on the C-6 reports, box #2 filed by WCVAF complied with the C-6 reporting requirements. &nbsp;</p><p>Based on our findings, that included: (1) the Committee timely filed the initial 21-Day Pre-General Election, the 7-Day Pre-General Election, and Post-General Election C-4 reports disclosing some of the expenditure details for the independent expenditures made in the form of political advertising and the candidates supported or opposed;

I don't know how many signs were produced or posted.” &nbsp;Concerning the fliers, he stated that Mr. Greene “did not contact me about the fliers being available. I don't know how many were printed and I don't know how they were distributed.”&nbsp;<br><br>Mr. Richards concluded by stating that “I did NOT solicit or accept any contributions to oppose the Charter Amendments on behalf of Kris Greene or any other person. I started the Just Vote No effort because there were no opposing arguments in the voter pamphlet.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Based on these findings, staff has determined in this instance that the activities undertaken by Cemal Richards in opposition to several of the 2021 Clark County Charter Amendments that included submitting opposition statements in the 2021 November 2, 2021, Clark County Voter’s Pamphlet and creating a website using his knowledge as a computer engineer did not require him to register and report as a ballot measure committee. &nbsp; Mr. Richards did not solicit or accept contributions to engage in his activities, and he did not incur any tangible costs to create the Vote No website. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Mr. Richard did not spend personal funds more than $100 so he was not required to file an Independent Expenditures report (C-6 report) in accordance with RCW 42.17A.255.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC has dismissed the allegations against Cemal Richards in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/100592","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""Cemal Richards Complaint Return Letter and Cover Ltr (PDC Case 100592).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5063/Cemal%20Richards%20Complaint%20Return%20Letter%20and%20Cover%20Ltr%20%28PDC%20Case%20100592%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Closed with no evidence of violation""}, {""file_name"" : ""100592 Just Vote No & Cemal Richards.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5063/100592%20Just%20Vote%20No%20%26%20Cemal%20Richards.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Email Response from Cemal Richards (PDC Case 100592).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5063/Email%20Response%20from%20Cemal%20Richards%20%28PDC%20Case%20100592%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2022-02-02T18:08:43.000"

The complaints alleged that the Pierce County Democratic Central Committee (PCDCC), a bona fide political party committee may have violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.235 and .240 by failing to timely and accurately file Monetary Contribution reports (C-3 reports) and Summary Full Campaign Contribution and Expenditure reports (C-4 reports), disclosing contributions and expenditures undertaken by the Campaign; and (2) RCW 42.17A.205 by failing to timely file an amended Committee Registration (C-1pc report) within ten days disclosing any material change in the committee information.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations listed in the two complaints filed; the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements; the response provided by Dominick Bergeron, former Treasurer for Pierce County Democratic Central Committee; the applicable PDC reports filed by Respondent; and queried the Respondent’s data in the PDC contribution and expenditure database, to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>Based on staff’s review, the alleged late and incomplete filed C-3 and C-4 reports cited in the two complaints were primarily caused by a Committee reorganization and changes in officers, but we noted that the Committee implemented additional internal controls to ensure compliance by creating an oversight committee, by conducting an internal audit, and additional training.&nbsp; These steps were taken, in part, by the Pierce County Democratic Central Committee to comply with the provisions of the settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on these findings staff has determined that, in this instance, failure to timely and accurately file 19 filed C-3 and C-4 reports, including amendments, mostly disclosed little monetary activity, or were filed as a result of an internal audit process conducted by PCDCC, and therefore does not warrant further investigation or enforcement action.</p><p>Pursuant to WAC 390-37-060(1)(d), the PCDCC received a formal written warning concerning failure to timely and accurately file Monetary Contributions reports (C-3 reports) and Summary Full Campaign Contribution and Expenditure reports (C-4 reports) disclosing contribution and expenditure activities and failure to timely file an amended Committee Registration (C-1pc report) disclosing material changes. The formal written warning included staff’s expectation that PCDCC timely file accurate and complete C-3, C-4 and C-1pc reports in future years in accordance with PDC laws and rules. The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules.<br>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/44695","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""42704 & 44695 Pierce Co Demo Cent Comm Formal Warning Ltr_0.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/2072/42704%20%26%2044695%20Pierce%20Co%20Demo%20Cent%20Comm%20Formal%20Warning%20Ltr_0.pdf"", ""description"" : ""42704 & 44695 Pierce Co Demo Cent Comm Formal Warning Ltr_0.pdf"", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}, {""file_name"" : ""44695 Pierce Co Democratic Central Committee Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/2072/44695%20Pierce%20Co%20Democratic%20Central%20Committee%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : ""44695 Pierce Co Democratic Central Committee Complaint.pdf"", ""document_type"" : null}]",,"2019-07-01T13:26:05.000"

We have double checked all contributions and his is the only contribution we made this mistake on.”</p><p>Based on these findings, staff has determined in this instance while the Campaign did exceed the contribution limits found in RCW 42.17A.405 by receiving a $1,000 over-limit contribution received from Mr. Marshall. &nbsp;PDC staff found the Campaign refunded the $1,000 over limit contribution from Mr. Marshall prior to the November 2, 2021 general election, once they became aware of exceeding the contribution limits; the Campaign had a significant cash on hand balance that confirmed the $1,000 over limit contribution received from Paul Marshall was not spent by the Campaign prior to being refunded. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Thus, PDC staff does not believe these facts amount to a material violation warranting further investigation or any enforcement action. &nbsp; PDC staff sent Joe Marine a letter reminding him about the importance of staying within the contribution limits of the office being sought for the remainder of the 2021 election cycle, and any election in the future in which his name appears on the ballot. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Based on this information, the PDC dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/99672","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""Marine, Joe Complaint Return with Reminder Letter (Wichert) PDC Case 99672.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4997/Marine%2C%20Joe%20Complaint%20Return%20with%20Reminder%20Letter%20%28Wichert%29%20PDC%20Case%2099672.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Reminder""}, {""file_name"" : ""99622 Anderson, Ron Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4997/99622%20Anderson%2C%20Ron%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : ""99622 Anderson, Ron Complaint"", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Email response from Joe Marine (PDC Case 99672).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4997/Email%20response%20from%20Joe%20Marine%20%28PDC%20Case%2099672%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2021-12-06T14:41:27.000"

Staff’s review found the following:</p><p>The Respondent is a candidate who filed with Elections officials on May 17, 2019 and was therefore required to file a Candidate Registration (C-1 report) and Personal Financial Affairs Statement (F-1 report) with the PDC within two weeks, or no later than May 31, 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>The Respondent filed a C-1 report and an F-1 report with the PDC on September 4, 2019, which is 96 days late. On the C-1 report, the Respondent selected the Mini-reporting Option, whereby a candidate’s campaign is not required to file C-3 &amp; C-4 reports with the PDC if they raise &amp; spend no more than $5,000 and receive no more than $500 from any one contributor.&nbsp;</p><p>In his response to the complaint, the Respondent indicated noncompliance was due to a family medical emergency. Based on these findings, staff determined that, in this instance, the Respondent’s failure to timely register as a candidate and file a statement of financial affairs does not amount to a violation that warrants further investigation. However, the PDC reminded the Respondent about the importance of timely filing all future PDC reports. The PDC has dismissed this matter&nbsp;in accordance with&nbsp;RCW 42.17A.755(1).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/55283","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""55283 Moon Ricky Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3138/55283%20Moon%20Ricky%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""55283 Moon Ricky Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3138/55283%20Moon%20Ricky%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""55283 Moon Ricky Reminder Letter.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3138/55283%20Moon%20Ricky%20Reminder%20Letter.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2021-03-24T10:17:46.000"

The complaint alleged that Coalition for a Better Northwest Washington (CBNWA), a political committee registered in 2019 making contributions to Whatcom County Council candidate, Ben Elenbaas, and independent expenditures opposing Whatcom County Executive candidate, Satpal Sidhu, may have violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.220 for failure to deposit monetary contributions within five business days of receipt; (2) RCW 42.17A.235 and .240 for failure to timely and accurately file Summary Full Campaign Contribution and Expenditure reports (C-4 reports) disclosing a monetary pledge; and (3) RCW 42.17A.420 for accepting contributions exceeding $5,000 from a single source within twenty-one days of an election.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations; the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements; the response provided by Dan Brady on behalf of his client CBNWA; the applicable PDC reports filed by Respondent; and queried the Respondent’s data in the PDC contribution and expenditure database], to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>During its review, staff found no evidence showing that the contributions from Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum Corp. were deposited late, reported on a C-3 or C-4 report late, or were received during a restricted time period for contributions exceeding $5,000 on the aggregate. It appears that CBNWA is aware that pledges are included in the statutory definition of a contribution and that it has a general understanding of filing deadlines, including “last minute contributions” (LMCs) disclosing contributions of $1,000 or more in the aggregate received before a general election.</p><p>Although the pledge from Marathon was timely reported October 22, 2019 on a C-3 report within 48 hours of being redeemed, staff found that the $5,000 pledge received by CBNWA on October 15, 2019, as described in Mr. Brady’s response, should have been disclosed within 48 hours of the pledge being made, or by no later than October 17, 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our findings staff has determined that, in this instance, failure to timely file a report disclosing the receipt of a pledge of $1,000 or more within 48 hours does not amount to a violation that warrants further investigation.</p><p>PDC staff reminded CBNWA about the importance of the timely disclosure of all contributions, including pledges, received during the time period and dollar amount described in RCW 42.17A.265 and the timely filings of all future PDC reports in accordance with the statutes and rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/59064","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""59064 Coalition for a Better Northwest Wa Reminder Letter.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3305/59064%20Coalition%20for%20a%20Better%20Northwest%20Wa%20Reminder%20Letter.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""59064 Coalition for a Better Northwest Washington Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3305/59064%20Coalition%20for%20a%20Better%20Northwest%20Washington%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""59064 Coalition for a Better Northwest Washington Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3305/59064%20Coalition%20for%20a%20Better%20Northwest%20Washington%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2019-11-26T08:54:52.000"

I have since reached out to them to ask for an invoice per our discussion last year and will be paying it as soon as possible.” &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Mr. Zappone stated that the students featured in his Campaign video “reached out to me through my internship and volunteer page on my campaign website. I did not use class time to recruit students or ask them to be in my videos.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Based on these findings, PDC staff found no evidence of a violation that would require conducting a more formal investigation into the complaint or pursuing enforcement action in this instance. &nbsp;PDC staff found no evidence that Zachary Zappone violated RCW 42.17A.555 by using the facilities of the Spokane School District to support his candidacy for Spokane City Council in 2021. &nbsp; The PDC has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1). &nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/99799","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""Email response from Zachary Zappone (PDC Case 99799).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5001/Email%20response%20from%20Zachary%20Zappone%20%28PDC%20Case%2099799%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""99799 Zappone, Zachary Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5001/99799%20Zappone%2C%20Zachary%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : ""99799 Zappone, Zachary Complaint"", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Zappone, Zachary Complaint Return Letter (Freeman) PDC Case 99799.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5001/Zappone%2C%20Zachary%20Complaint%20Return%20Letter%20%28Freeman%29%20PDC%20Case%2099799.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Closed with no evidence of violation""}]",,"2021-12-01T09:43:15.000"

(EY'21; October '21)","WAC 390-16-105","Case Closed with No Evidence of Violations",,"<p>A complaint was filed against Erica Norton, a candidate for Federal Way City Council in 2021, alleging that her 2021 Campaign may have violated WAC 390-16-105 by exceeding the $5,000 contribution and expenditure limitations of the Mini Reporting option.&nbsp;</p><p>On July 12, 2021, Erica Norton filed a Candidate Registration (C-1 report) with the PDC declaring her candidacy in 2021 for Federal Way City Council, Position #2, selecting the Mini Reporting option, and listing Michael Norton as Treasurer. &nbsp; Since there were only two candidates that filed for Federal Way City Council, Position #2, Ms. Norton did not appear on the August 3, 2021 primary election ballot.</p><p>Under the Mini Reportion option, candidates and their authorized committees are prohibited from raising and spending more than $5,000 in the aggregate and may not receive more than $500 in contributions in the aggregate contributions from any one source “<i>other than the candidate</i>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Norton stated the Campaign has not exceeded the $5,000 Mini Reporting limits, either in total contributions received or total expenditures made. &nbsp;She provided copies of the Campaign books of account that included invoices and receipts and an expenditures spreadsheet verifying her Campaign had not exceeded the Mini Reporting limits. &nbsp;The spreadsheet included expenditures made by the Campaign between May 12, 2021, ($159 for the candidate filing fee) through October 17, 2021 ($7.62 to boost a Facebook Ad).&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Norton stated that: (1) she designed her Campaign flyers on her laptop computer and she used the brochure templates provided by the vendor Vistaprint to create the flyers; (2) she purchased the yard signs for her Campaign from 55Printing.com, a printer out of Los Angeles, California, since they had offered the best prices; and (3) she designed her own yard signs.&nbsp;</p><p>The Campaign expenditures spreadsheet totaled $4,914.15 and listed 14 expenditures that included: (1) three expenditures made to Vistaprint totaling $485.25 to print “Campaign literature”; (2) a $1,460 expenditure made to One Spark Marketing on September 29, 2021 for a mailer; and (3) three expenditures made to 55Printing.com by the Campaign totaling $1,868.21 to print yard signs. &nbsp;Ms. Norton stated for her Campaign website she used WordPress to design her website which provided her with a variety of ""themes to choose from and the purchaser simply fills in the fields.” &nbsp;The spreadsheet listed a $43.50 expenditure was made by the Campaign on June 6, 2021, to NameCheap for the “Campaign domain and WordPress site.” &nbsp;PDC staff reviewed information online about WordPress and found a basic 50 GB single website with standard features and a free domain name for year started at a special rate of $2.95 a month. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Concerning contributions received by her Campaign, Ms. Norton stated that she received less than $5,000 in total contributions and acknowledged receiving three $500 contributions. &nbsp;She stated that she also received one $250 contribution, one $100 contribution with the rest of the contributions received being between $20-$50 each. &nbsp;She added “I am not even close to my contribution limit.” &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Ms. Norton stated “as a small business owner, I fully understand and live with the concept of &nbsp;<br>budgeting properly on a daily basis” and that she was aware of the Mini Reporting option limits and did not exceed them. &nbsp;She stated that “I don't have a campaign manager, I don't have a marketing consultant, I don't have an image consultant, I don't have a web designer, I don't have a treasurer, I don't have anyone to put up signs for me. &nbsp;These are all things I can do myself…” &nbsp; She stated that “sticking to a budget and being innovative with my marketing is what I've been doing over 11 years.” &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Based on this information, PDC staff found no evidence of a violation and that no additional action or investigation is warranted. &nbsp;PDC staff has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/99831","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""PDC Case 99831 Erica Norton response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5003/PDC%20Case%2099831%20Erica%20Norton%20response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Norton, Erica Complaint return ltr with no evidence of violation (Moore) PDC Case 99831.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5003/Norton%2C%20Erica%20Complaint%20return%20ltr%20with%20no%20evidence%20of%20violation%20%28Moore%29%20PDC%20Case%2099831.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""99831 Norton, Erica Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5003/99831%20Norton%2C%20Erica%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : ""99831 Norton, Erica Complaint"", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2021-10-27T17:28:40.000"

(See Exhibit F to Brian Brett Declaration). &nbsp; Chief Brett is currently the Fire Chief for both fire districts. &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Snure stated that on or about June 1, 2022, the two fire districts “used public resources to print and mail the Spring 2022 Newsletter to 34,345 Fire District residents” in both districts. &nbsp;He stated that the “printing and distribution of the 2022 Spring Newsletter complied with the above rules as it was a single jurisdiction-wide objective and fair presentation of the facts regarding the RFA ballot measure…” &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Snure stated that the newsletter was distributed by the “normal and regular means of communicating with the residents” of both districts, and added the complaint failed to “identify any specific language in the 2022 Spring Newsletter that asks voters to vote yes.” &nbsp;He stated that the complainant merely referenced the 2022 Spring Newsletter and made “the conclusory unsupported statement that the newsletter is ‘Supporting a yes vote for August 2, 2022, Primary.’” &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Snure stated the “text of the 2022 Spring Newsletter is factual and objective,” did not ask citizens or voters to “vote yes,” explained that both districts placed the ballot measure on the ballot, and the reasons the Fire Commissioners of the two districts placed the merger measure on the ballot. &nbsp;He stated that the “language used in the Article is neutral, objective and nonemotional” and added that the “only language that could possibly cause concern is the closing comment: “Thank you for supporting your Fire Districts!” &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Snure stated when that statement is “read out of context” he supposed it could be construed as asking voters to support the ballot measure but added that Chief Brett “consistently ends his Chief comments in newsletters with this phrase.” &nbsp;He noted that was not Chief Brett’s intent in this instance. &nbsp; He stated Chief Brett was the primary drafter of the newsletter, that the newsletter “was not submitted to the fire commissioners prior to publication”, and he “did not seek legal review as he believed the content complied with the PDC rules.” &nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Snure stated that if the proposed merger plan is approved at the August 2, 2022, primary election, “the combined fire districts will be placing a levy lid lift measure on the November 2022 general election ballot.” &nbsp;Finally, Mr. Snure stated that neither the Chelan County Fire District #1 and Douglas County Fire District #2 were involved in the production of the yard signs for the allegation listed in the complaint, and no public funds were used in relation to the signs in question. &nbsp;</p><p>It appears that the Chelan County Fire District #1 and Douglas County Fire District #2 created factual information regarding the August 2, 2022, merger ballot proposition and disseminated it in a manner consistent with the “normal and regular” conduct of the two districts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our findings that include that an administrative consolidation that took place between the Chelan County Fire District #1 and Douglas County Fire District #2 in 2021, and Fire Chief Brian Brett is the current Chief for both districts, staff has determined that, in this instance, the use of public funds to create and disseminate information about the proposed merger of the two districts appearing on the August 2, 2022, primary election ballot was allowable, and no evidence supports a finding of a violation that warrants further investigation. &nbsp;However, PDC staff is reminding officials of Chelan County Fire District #1 and Douglas County Fire District #2 &nbsp;about the importance of limiting the content of any information produced by the two districts regarding any future ballot propositions to factual information in accordance with the statutes, rules and PDC Interpretation No. 04-02. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Staff noted that the statements: (1) “We have this opportunity because of the amazing vision and planning of our past Fire Commissioners, Fire Chiefs, Volunteers, and personnel”; (2) “Our ability to recruit Volunteer Firefighters will increase because the opportunity for training and participation will double as a combined organization”; and (3) “the added opportunities for Volunteer Firefighters will help with retention” were more opinion than factual statements. &nbsp;</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/110057","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""110057 Officials of Douglas Co FD 2 and Chelan Co FD 1 Compliant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5361/110057%20Officials%20of%20Douglas%20Co%20FD%202%20and%20Chelan%20Co%20FD%201%20Compliant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Chelan -Douglas FD Response (Miller) PDC Case 110057.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5361/Chelan%20-Douglas%20FD%20Response%20%28Miller%29%20PDC%20Case%20110057.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Fire Chief Brian Brett Delcaration-attached documents (Miller) PDC Case 110057.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5361/Fire%20Chief%20Brian%20Brett%20Delcaration-attached%20documents%20%28Miller%29%20PDC%20Case%20110057.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""110057 Chelan - Douglas Co FD Merger Election- Complainant Return Letter (Respondent).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5361/110057%20Chelan%20-%20Douglas%20Co%20FD%20Merger%20Election-%20Complainant%20Return%20Letter%20%28Respondent%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Reminder""}]",,"2022-08-02T11:19:38.000"

The complaint alleged that Lisa Anderl, a 2019 City Council candidate for the City of Mercer Island may have violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.240(2) for failure to timely disclose complete address information for individual donors giving more than $100 in the aggregate on Monetary Contribution reports (C-3 reports); and (2) RCW 42.17A.405(14) for accepting over limit contributions from a political action committee.&nbsp;</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations; the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements; the responses provided by the Respondent; the applicable PDC reports filed by the Respondent; and queried the Respondent’s data in the PDC contribution and expenditure database, to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>The Respondent was a first-time candidate in the 2019 election. It appears that the missing donor address information was due to a general misunderstanding of the detailed address disclosure requirements expected on C-3 reports and not done intentionally to mislead the public.

Ms. Anderl paid a $150 civil penalty in accordance with WAC 390-37-143 (Brief Enforcement Penalty Schedule), which resolves the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our findings staff has determined that, in this instance, failure to timely file eight C-3 reports with complete house number and street addresses for ten individual donors, and failure initially to identify the committee treasurer as ministerial, does not amount to a finding of a violation that warrants further investigation. Pursuant to WAC 390-37-070, PDC staff is dismissing the remaining allegations and reminding Lisa Anderl about the importance of the accurate disclosure of all contribution and expenditure activities, specifically the inclusion of a full address for individual donors giving more than $100 in the aggregate, and the timely and accurate filings of all future PDC reports in accordance with the statutes and rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/96486","150.00","0.00","0.00","150.00","0.00","false","[{""file_name"" : ""96486 Anderl Lisa Supplemental Response 2.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Anderl%20Lisa%20Supplemental%20Response%202.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Anderl Lisa Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Anderl%20Lisa%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Anderl Lisa - Supplemental Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Anderl%20Lisa%20-%20Supplemental%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""SOU - 96486 - Lisa Anderl.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/SOU%20-%2096486%20-%20Lisa%20Anderl.pdf"", ""description"" : ""SOU - 96486 - Lisa Anderl"", ""document_type"" : ""Statement of understanding""}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Anderl Lisa Complaint Return Letter - Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Anderl%20Lisa%20Complaint%20Return%20Letter%20-%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Statement of understanding""}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Initial Hearing Results - Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Initial%20Hearing%20Results%20-%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Anderl Lisa Complaint Return Letter - Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Anderl%20Lisa%20Complaint%20Return%20Letter%20-%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Initial Hearing Results - Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Initial%20Hearing%20Results%20-%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""96486 Anderl Lisa - Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/4920/96486%20Anderl%20Lisa%20-%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]","[{""who"" : ""Anderl, Lisa"", ""address"" : null, ""order_date"" : null, ""due_date"" : ""2022-02-04"", ""amount"" : 150.00, ""description"" : ""SOU"", ""suspended_amount"" : 0.00, ""suspended_amount_description"" : null, ""reinstated_amount"" : 0.00, ""reinstated_amount_description"" : null, ""payments"" : [{""payment_date"" : ""2022-01-31"", ""amount"" : 150.00, ""description"" : ""PAID""}], ""sent_to_collections"" : null}]","2022-02-10T15:06:07.000"

The service provided by FedEx was printing mailers that supported candidate Jake Jacobson for Mercer Island City Council, Position 7, for payments in the amounts of: $4,240.52; $2,815.18; and $1,433.30.</li></ul><p>The documentation from FedEx in response to Mr. Finley’s initial request for inspection of the commercial advertiser provision was provided 34 days after Mr. Finley’s request for expenditures made by MISS, and 37 days after the request made by Mr. Brooks concerning the $1,433.30 expenditure made by MISS. &nbsp;</p><ul><li>On November 21, 2019, Mr. Finley sent an email to FedEx legal counsel, stating there were additional advertisements that he would like to inspect, including the FedEx records for all mailers for all of the 2019 candidates seeking election to the Mercer Island City Council. &nbsp;He requested the cost of each mailer, the number of items printed, either a hard copy or a PDF of the mailer, the date ordered and paid, and the date delivered and mailed. &nbsp;</li><li>On December 17, 2019, FedEx legal counsel sent an email to Mr. Finley stating that she was attaching the FedEx receipts for Mike Cero and the MISS advertisements, based on his request. &nbsp;The copies included three FedEx receipts totaling $8,488.98, dated October 13, 24, and 29, 2019, which listed the customer name (Mike Cero), the employee that provided the service, the purchase date, the number of postcards or envelopes printed, the postage costs, and the number of items mailed. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>The documentation from FedEx was provided to Mr. Finley 26 days after his follow-up request.</p><ul><li>On December 18, 2019, Mr. Finley sent an email to FedEx legal counsel requesting information for services provided to MISS for two additional mailers, including a $4,835 expenditure made on October 15, 2019, and a $5,202 expenditure made on October 21, 2019. &nbsp;In addition, Mr. Finley provided other possible names to search for in relation to these expenditures, including Susan, Olivia, Sophia or William Cero, Daniel or Dan Thompson, George Osborne and Daniel or Jake Jacobson. &nbsp;Finally, Mr. Finley also requested a copy of the mailer for the $4,240.52 expenditure made to FedEx on October 23, 2020.</li><li>On December 19, 2019, FedEx legal counsel sent an email to Mr. Finley stating that his email request had been forwarded to the FedEx Office, noting that it was a busy time of the year for her client, and requesting patience while they reviewed their records for the documents. On January 9, 2020, FedEx sent an email to Mr. Finley stating that FedEx had conducted a search and no records were found for any of the names he had provided. &nbsp;</li><li>On May 8, 2020, PDC staff sent an email to FedEx legal counsel stating staff had reached out to MISS for documentation concerning their reported expenditures made to FedEx during the 2019 election. &nbsp;</li><li>The email from PDC staff to FedEx legal counsel requested additional documents be provided to the PDC no later than May 22, 2020.

The October 18, 2019 request was fully complied with 34 days later. The November 21, 2019 request was fully complied with 26 days later. The December 18, 2019 request was fully complied with 155 days later.&nbsp;</li><li>The Commission is not making any exacting finding as to the number of days of impermissible delay (although the passing from the pre-election period into the post-election period has significance) but is simply concluding that, on the undisputed facts, each of the three responsive productions was not provided “promptly.” &nbsp;</li><li>This determination is not clouded by the fact that some of the delay may have been occasioned by FedEx’ good intentions in trying to protect client confidences, in diligently tracking down documents they had chosen to store in Texas and in engaging the PDC in extended dialogue over its responsibilities.&nbsp;</li><li>These circumstances may indeed constitute mitigation but do not provide any broad defense to the allegations. &nbsp;The Staff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>FedEx was subject to the obligations that the law imposes on a commercial advertiser and it failed to comply with those requirements with respect to these MISS campaign materials in the 2019 election. Respondent FedEx violated RCW 42.17A.345.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 24, 2022, an enforcement hearing was scheduled and conducted before the Commission&nbsp;concerning this matter. &nbsp;In the Final Order for Civil Penalty , the Commission found in determining the appropriate penalty in this matter:</p><ul><li><strong>Aggravating factors</strong> include that the Respondent is a large and sophisticated company with ample resources and should have understood its legal obligations when performing commercial advertising services in Washington State.</li><li>Respondent had no policies or procedures in place to inform staff of their obligations; the extensive delay in providing the records to Mr. Finley; and that the information was requested before the election but was not provided until after it. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mitigating factors i</strong>n this matter include: that this is the first violation of campaign finance laws by FedEx and the first time they have dealt with these issues in Washington.</li><li>Some of the delay in responding was due to FedEx working in good faith with counsel and PDC Staff as FedEx learned about their responsibilities; and that there was no intentional effort to deceive the public or violate the law by FedEx. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>The aggravating factors as cited, and as explained in oral comments on the record, outweigh the mitigating factors. &nbsp;The Commission has jurisdiction over this matter and the PDC laws and rules &nbsp;applicable to the allegations and to imposition of civil penalties. &nbsp;</p><p>On the facts as presented in this case, FedEx was acting as a commercial advertiser as defined by RCW 42.17A.005(10). &nbsp;FedEx violated RCW 42.17A.345 on three occasions by failing to maintain books of account and related materials as a commercial advertiser and to timely make them available to the public upon request.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commission has authority to impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation pursuant to RCW 42.17A.755 and WAC 390-37-182. The Commission concludes there were three separate violations in the lack of prompt statutory compliance with respect to the three public requests. Regardless of the number of violations found, the Commission’s conclusion as to the appropriate civil penalty would be the same. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pursuant to these findings and conclusions and the Commission’s Order on Summary Judgment of January 31, 2022, and considering the briefing and argument provided at the penalty hearing, the Commission finds by a vote of 4-0 that Respondent FedEx is hereby ordered to pay a civil penalty of $1,500 for each of the three violations to total a $4,500 civil penalty, with $2,000 of that amount suspended based on the following conditions: &nbsp;</p><ol><li>The non-suspended portion of the penalty ($2,500) is paid within thirty days of the date of the Final Order in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The Respondent is not found to have committed any further violations of chapter 42.17A RCW or Title 390 WAC within four years of the date of the Final Order in this matter. The suspended penalty shall not be assessed based solely &nbsp;upon any remediable violation, minor violation, or error classified by the commission as appropriate to address by a technical correction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If the Respondent fails to comply with any of the conditions of this Order, the suspended portion of the penalty shall immediately become due without further action by the Commission. &nbsp;</li></ol>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/60811","4500.00","2000.00","0.00","2500.00","0.00","false","[{""file_name"" : ""60811 FedEx Order on Motion for Summary Judgment.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/60811%20FedEx%20Order%20on%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""PDC Staff Brief regarding FedEx Penalty (PDC Case 60811).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/PDC%20Staff%20Brief%20regarding%20FedEx%20Penalty%20%28PDC%20Case%2060811%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""FedEx Memoradum to Commission regarding Penalty (PDC Case 68011).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/FedEx%20Memoradum%20to%20Commission%20regarding%20Penalty%20%28PDC%20Case%2068011%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""60811 FedEx Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/60811%20FedEx%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""FedEx Final Order concerning penalty (PDC Case 60811).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/FedEx%20Final%20Order%20concerning%20penalty%20%28PDC%20Case%2060811%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Commission order""}, {""file_name"" : ""60811 FedEx Initial Hearing Results - Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/60811%20FedEx%20Initial%20Hearing%20Results%20-%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""60811 FedEx Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/60811%20FedEx%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""FedEx ROI Final with Exhibits (Finley) PDC Case 60811.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/FedEx%20ROI%20Final%20with%20Exhibits%20%28Finley%29%20PDC%20Case%2060811.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""60811 FedEx Initial Hearing Results - Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3410/60811%20FedEx%20Initial%20Hearing%20Results%20-%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]","[{""who"" : ""FEDEX"", ""address"" : null, ""order_date"" : ""2022-03-02"", ""due_date"" : ""2022-04-01"", ""amount"" : 4500.00, ""description"" : null, ""suspended_amount"" : 2000.00, ""suspended_amount_description"" : ""Pay within 30 days"", ""reinstated_amount"" : 0.00, ""reinstated_amount_description"" : null, ""payments"" : [{""payment_date"" : ""2022-03-18"", ""amount"" : 2500.00, ""description"" : ""PAID""}], ""sent_to_collections"" : null}]","2022-03-21T15:21:38.000"

Your complaint alleged that the Washington Association of Realtors (WA Assn. of Realtors), a membership organization and lobbyist employer registered for calendar year 2019, may have violated RCW 42.17A.320 for failure to include sponsor identification on digital political advertising done in support of People for Nadine Woodward, a 2019 candidate for Spokane mayor.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations; the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements; the response provided in a related case by WA Realtors PAC, PDC Case #55218; and the applicable PDC reports filed by Respondent, to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>It appears that the online advertisements presented in support of the People for Nadine Woodward 2019 campaign were sponsored by WA Realtors PAC and that the advertisements contained sponsor identification required by RCW 42.17.320 and WAC 390-18-030 and were accessible through one click on the ad. The WA Assn. of Realtors did not sponsor the advertisements although they were identified as one of the top three contributors in the sponsor identification.</p><p>Based on these findings staff has determined that, in this instance, no evidence supports a finding of a violation warranting further investigation.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/55221","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""55221 Washington Association of Realtors Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3132/55221%20Washington%20Association%20of%20Realtors%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""55221 Washington Association of Realtors Complaint Return.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3132/55221%20Washington%20Association%20of%20Realtors%20Complaint%20Return.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2019-09-25T09:52:02.000"

(EY '22; Feb.

He stated there have been occasions when the district decided to not print or mail the newsletter, but otherwise it is a monthly newsletter.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the nine-page newsletter and found the February 2021-2022 edition contained a number of articles and photographs from several teachers that included: Elementary Technology, Welding Program/ Middle School Shop Class, Communities in Schools, Music Corner, Sports Information, Mini Cheer Camp, Republic Life Skills Class, Girls Club, and Weight Class. &nbsp;Superintendent Young stated that RSD staff and students “are invited to share information with our community in our monthly newsletters.”</p><p>Superintendent Young stated that he and the district recently became “aware of a staff member mentioning support for an upcoming levy in the newsletter. &nbsp;This should have been picked up by myself, or another staff member before sending this to print/mail. &nbsp;The district is aware that it can share information, but not actively campaign and seek support for ‘yes votes’.” &nbsp;</p><p>Staff’s review of the newsletter found the following information on page four of the newsletter under the heading “MUSIC CORNER” which stated: We have a levy that is being voted on in April. &nbsp;It is a levy that we currently have and it funds our music program and athletic program. &nbsp;Over half of my band kids are also involved in some kind of sport. &nbsp;They work hard. &nbsp;They practice their sport and practice their musical instruments and work hard in school. &nbsp;Please consider supporting the levy this April. &nbsp;Sara Cromwell” “Winterfest 2022. &nbsp; Republic band students put on a great show. &nbsp;We had several teachers talking to the community in search of support for the upcoming School Levy in April.”</p><p>Superintendent Young stated the newsletter is distributed to residents of the RSD through the US Postal Service and it is sent to all physical addresses and post office boxes as noted in the complaint. &nbsp;He stated in his initial email that the RSD, which he is ultimately responsible for the actions “did not properly proofread material provided for the district newsletter. &nbsp;I agree this is a violation and we are taking corrective measures to ensure it does not happen again. &nbsp;Clearly, we had an employee who didn't understand the rules around Levy elections and we also missed the mark in proofreading what was sent out to families.”</p><p>Superintendent Young stated that the Republic School District has enacted corrective actions and measures to ensure this will not happen again, that includes having “two different staff members in the district office proofread monthly newsletters” and to “notify the person creating the newsletter of campaign rules.” In addition, he stated the RSD will “notify all staff of the requirements regarding school elections and allowable activities if they want to support the levy outside of their work hours and not using any school facility or supplies.”</p><p>Superintendent Young apologized for the mistake, stated that he and RSD were looking forward to moving on from this, and that the inclusion of the statements from Ms. Cromwell “was an unintentional oversight that will not happen again.”</p><p>Based on these findings, PDC staff found no evidence of a violation that would require conducting a more formal investigation into the complaint or pursuing enforcement action in this instance. &nbsp;</p><p>However, pursuant to WAC 390-37-060(1)(d), the PDC is issuing a formal written warning to Superintendent Kevin Young concerning the prohibitions of using Republic School District facilities and resources, including allowing comments to be made in the RSD newsletter in support of or opposition to any candidate, or ballot proposition. &nbsp;The formal written warning includes staff’s expectation that Superintendent Young will follow through on the corrective action and measures as noted in his response, particularly the notification of RSD staff and teachers concerning the prohibitions and restrictions found in PDC Interpretation #01-03, Guidelines for School Districts in Election Campaigns. &nbsp;</p><p>Superintendent Young will be advised that the Commission will consider this formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action, should there be future violations of PDC laws or rules. &nbsp;The PDC has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/104340","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""104340 Republic School District 309 Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5140/104340%20Republic%20School%20District%20309%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Republic School District - Supt Kevin Young Complaint Return Ltr with Warning.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5140/Republic%20School%20District%20-%20Supt%20Kevin%20Young%20Complaint%20Return%20Ltr%20with%20Warning.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}, {""file_name"" : ""Email Response from Kevin Young, Supt Republic SD + Newsletter (PDC Case 104340).pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5140/Email%20Response%20from%20Kevin%20Young%2C%20Supt%20Republic%20SD%20%2B%20Newsletter%20%28PDC%20Case%20104340%29.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2022-03-08T17:49:10.000"

Staff reviewed the complaint filed by Ms. Franco-Malone and, finding the allegations similar and related to the same two political advertisements already being investigated under the original complaint filed by Mr. Erwin, merged the two complaints and notified Ms. Franco-Malone of this action on November 12, 2021. The complaints alleged that Seth Landau, a sponsor of an independent expenditure advertisement, may have violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.255 &amp; .260 for failure to timely and accurately disclose independent expenditures on a C-6 report; and (2) RCW 42.17A.320 by failing to include proper sponsor identification on political advertisements sponsored by him.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations; the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements; the responses provided by the Respondent; the applicable PDC reports filed by the Respondent; and queried the Respondent’s data in the PDC contribution and expenditure database, to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>Regarding the late C-6 filing, it appears that this was likely due to Mr. Landau’s technical difficulties with the C-6 filing application. Staff noted, however, that Mr. Landau successfully filed a C-6 report in calendar year 2019 after encountering the same technical issue. Concerning the missing sponsor identification, staff found no evidence that Mr. Landau purposely failed to include complete sponsor identification on two political advertisements he sponsored that appeared in the same newspaper one week apart or that he otherwise attempted to mislead the public.</p><p>Based on our findings staff has determined that, in this instance, submittal of a C-6 report disclosing an independent expenditure two days late and failure to include required sponsor identification on two political advertisements does not amount to a finding of a violation that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Pursuant to WAC 390-37-060(1)(d), however, Seth Landau will receive a formal written warning concerning failure to timely disclose independent expenditures within five days and failure to include full sponsor identification on a political advertisement sponsored by him. The formal written warning will include staff’s expectation that Mr. Landau timely files all future required reports of independent expenditures and that he ensures the required sponsor id is included on political advertisements he sponsors. The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/100171","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""100171 Landau Seth Complaint 2.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5029/100171%20Landau%20Seth%20Complaint%202.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100171 Landau Seth Warning Letter - Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5029/100171%20Landau%20Seth%20Warning%20Letter%20-%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}, {""file_name"" : ""100171 Landau Seth Warning Letter - Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5029/100171%20Landau%20Seth%20Warning%20Letter%20-%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100171 Landau Seth Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5029/100171%20Landau%20Seth%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100171 Landau Seth Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5029/100171%20Landau%20Seth%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100171 Landau Seth Supplemental Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5029/100171%20Landau%20Seth%20Supplemental%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2021-12-16T13:58:50.000"

On these amended reports, the committee’s name was changed to “Citizens for Lopez Solid Waste Levy sponsored by Solid Waste Alternative(s) Program (SWAP).”&nbsp;</p><p>PDC laws and rules do not require a committee to retroactively amend its C-3 reports to reflect a registered name change.</p><p>Based on these findings, staff determined that, in this instance, failure to include the sponsor’s name in the committee’s registered name does not amount to a violation that warrants further investigation.

In addition , after receiving the complaint, the Committee filed an amended 7-Day Pre-General Election C-4 report on November 20, 2019, disclosing four orders were placed on October 24, 2019 with Progressive Strategies to print the mailer.</p><p>Staff’s review of the facts found that Common Purpose PAC: (1) was a federal committee registered with the FEC and domiciled in Washington State for all of calendar year 2019; (2) made contributions to local candidates in Washington state for the first time and late in the 2019 election cycle, and&nbsp;fully cooperated with PDC staff; (3) based on the Commissions rule, was a first-time committee that was required to register and report with PDC based solely on being domiciled in Washington State; (4) the federal committee file a voluntary C-5 report five days early; and (5) the candidates that received in-kind contributions for the mailer timely disclosed that activity on the C-4 reports. &nbsp;</p><p>Based on these findings, staff has determined in this instance, the late filed reports do not warrant further investigation.&nbsp; PDC staff has reminded Common Purpose PAC to timely and accurately register and report as an in-state committee, including filing C-3 and C-4 reports disclosing contribution, expenditure and orders placed, should it undertake activities involving candidates or ballot propositions in Washington State in the future as required for a political committee. &nbsp;The PDC has dismissed the complaint in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/59777","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""Common Purpose PAC Complaint Return with Reminder Cover Ltr (Morgan) PDC Case 59777.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3377/Common%20Purpose%20PAC%20Complaint%20Return%20with%20Reminder%20Cover%20Ltr%20%28Morgan%29%20PDC%20Case%2059777.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""59777 Common Purpose PAC Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3377/59777%20Common%20Purpose%20PAC%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Common Purpose PAC response (Morgan) PDC Case 59777.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3377/Common%20Purpose%20PAC%20response%20%28Morgan%29%20PDC%20Case%2059777.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2020-01-03T10:58:59.000"

The complaint alleged that the King County Democratic Central Committee, a county bona fide political party committee, may have violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.240 for failure to accurately identify a Limited Liability Company (LLC) as an in-kind contributor on Summary Full Campaign Contribution and Expenditure report (C-4 report) for January 2019; (2) RCW 42.17A.235 for failure to timely file the C-4 report for January 2019; and (3) RCW 42.17A.235 for failure to timely amend C-4 reports for January 2019 through April 2019 within 21 days.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations and supporting documentation; the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements; the response provided by Deputy Treasurer, Jason Bennett, on behalf of the Respondent; the applicable PDC reports filed by the Respondent; and queried the Respondent’s data in the PDC contribution and expenditure database, to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>It appears that the alleged late reporting of amended C-4 reports for January 2019 to April 2019 were done to ensure contribution and expenditure totals were accurate and up to date. Four of the five amended reports were made more than two months prior to the August 6, 2019 primary election and accounted for 3.5% of the total contributions and 5% of the total expenditures disclosed for calendar year. Further, it appears that the alleged incorrect disclosure of the two January 2019 in-kind contributions was due to the Respondent’s desire for more transparency given the relationship of the donor to her business and to the Respondent. Staff found no evidence that the errors were intentional or done to confuse or mislead the public.</p><p>Based on our findings staff has determined that, in this instance, failure to timely file four amended C-4 reports for January 2019 to April 2019 and failure to identify the accurate source of two in-kind contributions on the January 2019 C-4 report, does not amount to a finding of a violation that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Pursuant to WAC 390-37-060(1)(d), however, King County Democratic Central Committee will receive a formal written warning concerning failure to timely disclosure the accurate source of in-kind contributions and failure to file timely amendments to C-4 reports within 21 days. The formal written warning will include staff’s expectation that KCDCC timely files all future required reports of contributions and expenditures including amendments when necessary. The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/102184","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""102184 King County Democratic Central Committee Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5084/102184%20King%20County%20Democratic%20Central%20Committee%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""102184 King Co Democratic Central Committee Warning -  Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5084/102184%20King%20Co%20Democratic%20Central%20Committee%20Warning%20-%20%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}, {""file_name"" : ""102184 King County Democratic Central Committee Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5084/102184%20King%20County%20Democratic%20Central%20Committee%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""102184 King Co Democratic Central Committee Warning -  Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5084/102184%20King%20Co%20Democratic%20Central%20Committee%20Warning%20-%20%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2022-03-28T09:05:01.000"

The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/100349","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""100349 Skansi John Warning - Complainant.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5049/100349%20Skansi%20John%20Warning%20-%20Complainant.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100349 Skansi John Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5049/100349%20Skansi%20John%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100349 Skansi John Warning - Respondent.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5049/100349%20Skansi%20John%20Warning%20-%20Respondent.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}, {""file_name"" : ""100349 Skansi John Complaint 3.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5049/100349%20Skansi%20John%20Complaint%203.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""100349 Skansi John Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/5049/100349%20Skansi%20John%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2022-01-25T10:16:18.000"

The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/17106","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""17106 MassTransitNow Response - Redacted 5.28.19.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/1439/17106%20MassTransitNow%20Response%20-%20Redacted%205.28.19.pdf"", ""description"" : ""17106 MassTransitNow Response with Attachments"", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""MassTransitNowComplaint-WithAttachments.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/1439/MassTransitNowComplaint-WithAttachments.pdf"", ""description"" : ""MassTransitNowComplaint-WithAttachments.pdf"", ""document_type"" : null}, {""file_name"" : ""17106 Mass Transit Now Warning Letter.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/1439/17106%20Mass%20Transit%20Now%20Warning%20Letter.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : ""Warning""}]",,"2020-04-16T16:01:37.000"

The complaint alleged that Clay Shaya, a write-in candidate for Whatcom County Sheriff in the November 5, 2019 general election, may have violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.205 for failure to file a Candidate Registration (C-1 report) within two weeks of declaring candidacy; (2) RCW 42.17A.700 for failure to file a Personal Financial Affairs Statement (F-1 report) within two weeks of declaring candidacy; and (3) RCW 42.17A.235 for failure to timely and accurately file Monetary Contribution reports (C-3 reports) and Summary Full Campaign Contribution and Expenditure reports (C-4 reports), disclosing contributions and expenditures undertaken by the Campaign.</p><p>PDC staff reviewed the allegations; and the applicable statutes, rules, and reporting requirements, to determine whether the record supports a finding of one or more violations.</p><p>Mr. Shaya has no filing history with the PDC as a candidate or appointed official and has not been found in violation of PDC laws or rules. He was not successful in the election for Whatcom County Sheriff and the small number of votes he may have received as a write-in candidate appears to have had little impact on the final outcome of the election as the total votes for all write-ins accounted for only 0.17%.</p><p>During its review, staff found evidence to suggest that Mr. Shaya was a candidate as defined in RCW 42.17A.005(8) and was required by RCW 42.17A.205 to file a C-1 report and by RCW 42.17A.700 to file an F-1 report, both by no later than September 27, 2019. Despite numerous attempts to illicit a response from Mr. Shaya regarding this evidence, staff has had no communication from him, and the C-1 report and F-1 report have not been received.</p><p>Based on our findings staff has determined that, in this instance, failure to timely file the C-1 report as a candidate and a candidate F-1 report covering the previous twelve months, does not amount to a finding of a violation that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Pursuant to WAC 390-37-060(1)(d), however, Mr. Shaya received a formal written warning concerning failure to timely file a C-1 report and F-1 report as a candidate for local office in 2019. The formal written warning will included staff’s expectation that Mr. Shaya timely files all required reports as a candidate for state or local office, beginning with the Candidate Registration (C-1 report) and the Personal Financial Affairs Statement (F-1 report) in future years. The Commission will consider the formal written warning in deciding on further Commission action if there are future violations of PDC laws or rules.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC finds that no further action is warranted and has dismissed this matter in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/58722","0","0","0","0","0","false","[{""file_name"" : ""58722 Shaya Clay Warning Letter.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3289/58722%20Shaya%20Clay%20Warning%20Letter.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""58722 Shaya Clay Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3289/58722%20Shaya%20Clay%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]",,"2019-12-18T14:40:09.000"

All such direct lobbying was for official purposes and through official channels and was thus lawful. “The complaint filed also alleged that I engaged in a grass roots lobbying campaign… My conduct did not amount to such a violation, because no covered expenditures were made to present a program to the public within the meaning of the section.&nbsp; Last, the complaint filed alleged that I personally benefited from the proposed legislation and abused my authority to negotiate with private organizations in exchange for their legislative support.""&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>“There is no merit to these allegations. I hereby enter this (SOU) with respect to indirect lobbying violations in consideration of and with the understanding that the PDC will close the complaint with no findings of violation with respect to the other complaint allegations. Concurrent herewith, I am also executing a Statement of Understanding as it relates to the failure of BORPELS to timely file lobbying reports for Q1/2019 and Q2/2019, which the PDC raised on its own initiative in the course of investigating the complaint.”</i></p><p>On April 24, 2020, PDC received a completed Statement Of Understanding (SOU) and a $150 civil penalty payment from Ken Fuller. The $150 civil penalty assessed against Mr. Fuller in this matter was done in accordance with WAC 390-37-143 (Brief Enforcement Penalty Schedule).&nbsp; By completing the SOU, Mr. Fuller acknowledged violations of&nbsp;RCW 42.17A.635 by using BORPELS equipment, resources and staff time to engage in an indirect lobbying effort in support of legislation.</p><p>Based on this information and the facts, the PDC has dismissed the complaint in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).&nbsp;</p>","https://www.pdc.wa.gov/rules-enforcement/enforcement/enforcement-cases/57847","150.00","0.00","0.00","150.00","0.00","false","[{""file_name"" : ""Ken Fuller & BORPELS Complaint Return Letter with SOU's and Cover Ltr  (Hart) PDC Cases 57847 & 67383.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3240/Ken%20Fuller%20%26%20BORPELS%20Complaint%20Return%20Letter%20with%20SOU%27s%20and%20Cover%20Ltr%20%20%28Hart%29%20PDC%20Cases%2057847%20%26%2067383.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""57847 Fuller Ken Complaint.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3240/57847%20Fuller%20Ken%20Complaint.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Ken Fuller and BORPELS ROI with Exhibits (Cody Hart) PDC Cases 57847 & 67383.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3240/Ken%20Fuller%20and%20BORPELS%20ROI%20with%20Exhibits%20%28Cody%20Hart%29%20PDC%20Cases%2057847%20%26%2067383.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""57847 Fuller Ken Complaint Supplement.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3240/57847%20Fuller%20Ken%20Complaint%20Supplement.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}, {""file_name"" : ""Statement of Understanding - PDC Case 57847 - Ken Fuller.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3240/Statement%20of%20Understanding%20-%20PDC%20Case%2057847%20-%20Ken%20Fuller.pdf"", ""description"" : ""Statement of Understanding - PDC Case 57847 - Ken Fuller"", ""document_type"" : ""Statement of understanding""}, {""file_name"" : ""57847 Fuller Ken Response.pdf"", ""url"" : ""https://pdc-case-tracking.s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/3240/57847%20Fuller%20Ken%20Response.pdf"", ""description"" : """", ""document_type"" : """"}]","[{""who"" : ""Ken Fuller"", ""address"" : null, ""order_date"" : null, ""due_date"" : ""2020-04-30"", ""amount"" : 150.00, ""description"" : null, ""suspended_amount"" : 0.00, ""suspended_amount_description"" : null, ""reinstated_amount"" : 0.00, ""reinstated_amount_description"" : null, ""payments"" : [{""payment_date"" : ""2020-04-30"", ""amount"" : 150.00, ""description"" : ""PAID""}], ""sent_to_collections"" : null}]","2020-04-30T14:58:17.000"

Charter Amendments in 2021 (Nov '21)","RCW 42.17A.205, RCW 42.17A.255","Case Closed with No Evidence of Violations",,"<p>A complaint was filed against Carolyn Crain and the Southwest WA Federated Republican Women’s Club (SWFRWC), alleging that Ms. Crain and the SWFRWC violated: (1) RCW 42.17A.205, .235, and .240 by failing to register and file reports as a local ballot measure committee in opposition to the Clark County Charter Amendments that appeared on the November 2, 2021 general election; or (2) RCW 42.17A.255 by failing to file reports of Independent Expenditure (C-6 report) disclosing independent expenditures made in opposition to the Clark County Charter Amendments.&nbsp;</p><p>For the 2021 election cycle, there were 10 Clark County Charter Amendments that appeared on the November 2, 2021, general election.</p><p>Staff reviewed the November 2, 2021, Clark County general election results and found the voters approved eight of the ten Charter Amendments: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9.</p><p>Carolyn Crain, as First Vice-President of the SWFRWC, stated based on her knowledge she did “not believe that there was any formal committee coordinated regarding this issue. There were hundreds of upset people over the failure of the County Council to properly perform their duties and to publish a voter’s pamphlet without any opposition statements to the amendments.” &nbsp;She stated SWFRWC is a small women's club with 12 members, and that they “do not donate to or endorse candidates. We do attempt to keep people informed on legislation and items that will be on their ballots. We have a website and a Facebook page and monthly meetings with speakers.”&nbsp;<br><br>Ms. Crain stated she designed a handout/flyer to use at the SWFRWC meeting using her own computer and Office 365 publisher. &nbsp;She stated that she printed the flyers from her computer at her home using her own “paper stock and ink. I am not sure what the ink and paper cost me at this time because I did not go out and buy it for this purpose. I did print 200 Flyers.” &nbsp;She stated SWFRWC held its monthly October meeting in which the Clark County Charter amendments were the topic of the discussion, and that there were about 60 people in attendance. &nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Crain stated she made the flyers available at the meeting and that some of the attendees took flyers with them. &nbsp;She estimated that she spent less than $75 in total using her personal funds for the materials and the use of her computer, and she added that amount may have been a little high. &nbsp;She stated that Kris Greene was one of the people in attendance at the meeting, and at the end of the SWFRWC meeting she gave the remaining fliers to Mr. Greene for him to distribute at his office. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Crain stated Mr. Greene informed her that he distributed the fliers to a few people and some people took a few more from his office, but the bulk of them “landed in the trash after the election when I spoke to him. &nbsp;As noted in the February 2, 2022, PDC resolution letter concerning the Kris Greene and Cemal Richards complaints (PDC Cases #100592 and #101696), Mr. Greene stated the SWFRWC [sic] printed the “Vote No” fliers and made them available to him. &nbsp;He indicated that he did not “recall the exact number” of flyers that he took, but he made them available at his office. &nbsp;He estimated that he had about 50 fliers sitting on a table in the front lobby of his office “for folks to stop in and take them.” &nbsp;He stated that Mr. Richards also picked up some fliers, but he had no idea how many he took.</p><p>Concerning the yard sign allegation, staff reviewed the yard signs which were two-sided, white corrugated plastic, and appeared to be slightly larger than the standard 14” x 22” yard signs and stated “VOTE NO Charter Amendments 1-9!! &nbsp;Save Your Voice!! Stop the Gerrymander of District Lines.” &nbsp;The yard signs did not have any other identifying information included such as a website or email address, no contact information or sponsor name, and no union bug or printer identification number. &nbsp;In accordance with WAC 390-18-030(2)(e) yard sings that are smaller than 8’ x 4’ dimensions are exempt from the sponsor identification requirements.</p><p>Ms. Crain stated that the yard signs were left at her house on her front porch at the house while she was not at home, by an individual. &nbsp;She stated there “were only a couple of dozen yard signs at the most with a sticky note attached to them from Tom. &nbsp;I could not find out who that was.” &nbsp;She stated that after the signs had been left, she gave the yard signs to Mr. Greene since she had several things going on and she did have time to deal with them. &nbsp;Mr. Greene stated in his response that the SWFRWC made the yard signs available to him, and that he picked up the “Vote No” signs at the home of Carolyn Crain, First Vice-President of the SWFRWC. &nbsp;He stated that he had no idea who printed the signs.</p><p>Neither Ms. Crain or the SWFRWC solicited or accepted any contributions to oppose the Clark Charter Amendments. &nbsp;Ms. Crain previously stated that she used her personal funds and resources to print the fliers.</p><p>Based on these findings, staff has determined in this instance that the activities undertaken by Carolyn Crain in opposition to several of the 2021 Clark County Charter Amendments, that included her using her personal computer and printer to produce 200 fliers costing an estimated $75, did not require her to file an Independent Expenditures report (C-6 report) of $100 or more in accordance with RCW 42.17A. &nbsp;</p><p>PDC staff found no evidence that Ms. Crain solicited or accepted contributions to support or oppose any of the 2021 Clark County Charter Amendments, and was not required to register and file reports as a political or ballot measure committee. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition, staff found no evidence that the Southwest Washington Federated Republican Women’s Club made any expenditures to oppose any of the 2021 Clark County Charter Amendments, and they did not solicit or accept any contributions to support or oppose the 2021 Clark County Charter Amendments. &nbsp;Thus, the Southwest Washington Federated Republican Women’s Club was not required to register and file reports as a political committee or ballot measure committee. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, based on the lack of information as noted above concerning the “Vote No” yard signs, PDC staff was not able to ascertain the person responsible for paying for and sponsoring the yard signs, or the printer responsible for producing the yard signs, despite investigative efforts.</p><p>Based on this information, the PDC has dismissed the allegations against Carolyn Crain and Southwest Washington Federated Republican Women’s Club, in accordance with RCW 42.17A.755(1).
