It is easy to utilize, results are quick, we are able to schedule and pay for the appointments for potential members and supervisors. We participated in a trial run of FieldPrint and our experience was AWFUL. During the pilot run of using the Fieldprint system, we asked to participate just so we could see how the system worked. We have not had findings for our processing of background checks as we follow the rules and process required in our state. When we were working on just getting the three staff scheduled for the new Field Print system for fingerprinting, we ran into quite an issue. There are many less sites available to get FBI prints done at with this new vendor. I took each of our main Club's addresses and put them into the Field Print system to find out how far away the sites were. In some cases it's quite a distance. I think this would significantly impair our ability to get our members to these locations just based on distance. I know you can do the actual print card if needed but that adds quite a bit of additional time. One of my staff members would have to drive over 34 miles one way to get her prints done at the closest facility. 50% of our 34 locations would have to travel over 20 miles to get to a Field Print location, 11 of our Clubs have a site in town and the last 11 would have to travel between 9.2 and 18.8 miles. Currently using the Indiana State Police/FBI system, all 33 of our locations have a site within their town; the one that does not, they would travel 9.2 miles to get to the closest location. We serve a high number of high school and college individuals in our program and this would be an excessive obstacle for them to participate. I feel that we would lose a lot of potential members and some of our Clubs would be unable to recruit for this due to the distance and cost. We also have experienced another issue - the credit card on file that we put on our account didn't allow my two staff to schedule their prints. I went in to double and triple check and all the info is right. I then called the customer support center where after a couple of minutes on hold, they made me leave a message. They NEVER called me back. Another issue we have found is that if a potential member or staff misses their appointment or needs to reschedule that appointment (with less than 24 hours' notice), we are going to be charged $17.50 for those rescheduled appointments. Currently the IdentoGo allows us to reschedule at no additional cost. I easily have probably a dozen or so individuals that either miss the appointment or cancel within 24 hours. This will be an added cost that we didn't calculate into the budget figures. WHY WHY WHY would the federal government ask us to pay $7.50 for an NSOPW when you have access to that system for free???? This is such an example of government waste. There is no reason that we should have to pay for this. For two of my staff, when we received the information from Fieldprint on their results, the information said that they couldn't confirm the information and therefore told us that we had to go to another vendor to verify the results. When I tried to do this, imagine my surprise when the ""additional"" vendor was our current existing State Police/FBI that we are already using. In addition, they would add an additional cost on top of the already expensive $75ish for the criminal history check. With this additional cost, it takes it up and over $100 for the background checks. This is pure wasteful spending of government dollars. I understand that there are grantees not following the rules but instead of causing us all to triple the cost of our background check process, pay for FREE items - remove them from the program, make them pay the money back. If you don't follow the rules, there should be consequences. The National Office needs to train their state commissions to follow the process that works in their state at a reasonable cost and then make all grantees follow those. We pay under $40 right now for our FBI BACKGROUND CHECK - reasonable. Paying over $100",,"2","3",,,"6",,,,,,,,,,"POINT (-86.044718 39.783287)"

That Fieldprint says a 'cleared' recommendation does not mean that an individual has no criminal record is not a sufficient rubric for determining suitability to serve. It is important for our agency to have access to a complete rap sheet on criminal background enabling our program to make fully informed decisions on placing applicants with vulnerable populations. This increases our costs above the already increased cost of conducting the CHBC through the vendor. 2. Less than 1/3 of our potential applicants have access to a Livescan site. During the opt in, we tried two ways to streamline our need for procuring a 3rd print card necessary for the state check/rap sheet: 1. we had new applicants take an extra print card to the law enforcement agency that does prints. Inevitably, the incorrect card(s) were sent in to Fieldprint. 2. We then had the applicant go to law enforcement a 2nd time so the cards wouldn't get mixeed up. With limited hours prints can be done, and often waits upwards to an hour before prints are taken, this makes the process burdensome and confusing for many elders. This exerts an extra barrier to the on-boarding process. 3. Law enforcement departments in some of our very small communities often do not have sufficient experience with the older population, or experience taking many prints. Often quality is poor which prolongs the process b/c they have to be re-sent the print packets, often discouraging applicants/potential volunteers from following through. 4. Cost of NSOPW is free 5. Cost of Federal and State check is significantly less than these vendors 6. The increased time it takes for the whole FP process in my service area will act as a deterrent when we are already having recruitment and retention issues. During the opt-in period, it took me and some of our FGs over 2w to get the FP packet in the mail. 7. Our State DCI process quite efficient, taking approximately 2 weeks (approximately 4 if a set of prints needs a name check due to poor quality). 8. In a time when online security is becoming more and more tenuous, it is poor practice for a private vendor to be the gatekeeper of the personal information of our vulnerable population. 9. While this may increase compliance, it doesnt necessarily keep the vulnerable safer. Crimes of abuse, neglect, exploitation, etc. often go unreported or are dealt with internally, and would not appear on a CHBC anyway. 10. We have never done accompaniment at volunteer sites while awaiting the CHBC to come back. In fact, our current procedure is to have applicants sign a waiver during the initial pre-service meeting agreeing to have NO contact with any potential volunteer site. We have always allowed any local applicants that have access to our Project Coordinators (~ are in our outlying service area and do all training on their own/with our help over the phone) to attend in-service training b/c the Coordinator is there among the small group of our volunteers. Our volunteers have always used the time between our sending the prints off and getting the results back in one-on-one pre-service with myself or my Coordinators, and working on all of their pre-service assignments so that when I get their checks back, they are ready to go interview with their potential volunteer site. Prohibiting even the initiation of pre-service training until CHBC results are back will further delay the whole process. For what it's worth, our current policy is for the start of pre-service only after applicants have initiated their State/FBI checks, and any payment of stipend only occurs if 1. their checks are cleared, AND 2. they complete their pre-service paperwork. Finally, I feel that the actual process/procedure (the step-by-step initiation and completion) of the CHC should be the focus of this effort. Requiring programs with vast service areas and unique needs to adopt a process which is burdensome to both staff and applicants, confusing to applicants in the end, often acts as a barrier to serve.","1","2","3","4",,,"7","8",,,,"12",,,,"POINT (-105.590794 41.313241)"

3. Fieldprint doesn't provide the program or organization a finding report. Therefore, if we want our FGP's in Head Start programs, we have to reprint them again. In addition, it does not meet the organizational employment requirements, requiring a possible third print that the program must also pay for. This is an inadequate use of grant funding.

Thus, it does not fully mitigate risk and only partially meets CNCS legislative requirements. 3) CNCS-affiliated accounts with the currently contracted vendors, Truescreen and Fieldprint, do not have the capabilities to incorporate state-specific, grantee, sub-grantee and service location screening eligibility. Thus, additional screening requirements will need to be conducted increasing costs and administrative burden. 4) Requiring use of vendors to conduct the NSCHC increases the cost of program administration. A non-matched grant or funding source would alleviate this burden. 5) Requiring the use of vendors to conduct the NSCHC reduces the ability of state service commissions to monitor the process thus increasing potential for risk. 6) Requesting a waiver for good cause could reduce administrative and cost burdens however, the waiver process and criteria are not included.
The proposed changes to the CNCS NSCHC requirements present the following benefits 1) Requiring all individuals to conduct a three-part check removes differing interpretations of re-occurring access to vulnerable populations and aligns with many state-level requirements. 2) Requiring checks to be completed prior to work or service removes the administrative burden pertaining to accompaniment","1","2",,,,,,,"9",,,,"13",,,"POINT (-83.005803 39.965574)"

I have been running AmeriCorps programs since 1996 and, frankly, this is the most asinine proposal CNCS has ever put forward. There are simply too many holes in the system to ensure the safety of our beneficiaries. I have no objection to requiring the three-part check and requiring all clearances to be received before service or employment begins. We do that already. However, I strongly object to the use of the CNCS-approved vendors, namely Truescreen and Fieldprint. Currently, our applicants are fingerprinted at our main office on Live Scan and must receive clearances from both the California Department of Justice and FBI before starting their terms of service or employment. Program staff conducts and documents all NSOPW checks and, if necessary, contacts the appropriate approved agency for out-of-state residents, again before service begins. Our Human Resources Director reviews any applicants for which we receive reports of prior criminal convictions and determines if they are still eligible to serve or be employed in our schools, based on whether or not the conviction was for an offense prohibited by the state Education Code or if they failed to disclose the conviction on their application. The CNCS vendor for state checks, Truescreen, fails to ensure that measure of safety because the California DOJ and over 30 other state agencies are not linked into its system. Fieldprint fails to ensure adequate FBI checks because we, as the lead agency, are not allowed to view any records that come up. Conceivably, Fieldprint may find an applicant who has a prior conviction but is deemed eligible to serve because the offense was not prohibited by AmeriCorps. However, our HR Director will have no way of knowing if the offense makes the person ineligible to work in California schools. If this rule is approved as written, we will have to require our applicants to be fingerprinted through our office to ensure they have full clearances from the DOJ and FBI, and then require them to drive to the other side of the city to the only Truescreen/Fieldprint facility in our county and be fingerprinted there, just to comply with CNCS regulations. This just adds to the cost of our program. I understand that CNCS is proposing these vendors because it wants a consistent nationwide of NSCHC compliance. However, such a system does not currently exist. It does not provide the assurance we all need for the safety of those we serve.

By changing the rule so that everyone one in a covered position, whether they have access to a vulnerable population or not, must have all three checks complete and adjudicated before beginning a paid position you are making hiring auxiliary staff that are not exposed to vulnerable populations much more difficult. Until now we could hire a receptionist or member of maintenance and begin their orientation once two of the three checks were complete and the third initiated. Having to wait what could be five or six weeks to begin a job would deter many applicants. My agency already waits for all three checks to be complete and adjudicated when the individual is taking a volunteer position or a staff position that gives them access to vulnerable populations, it would be better served to adjust this rule to mandate all three checks must be completed and adjudicated if the subject will have access to a vulnerable population and continuing with the original of two complete and the third initiated for subjects that will not have access to vulnerable populations. The vendors also limit their reports to cleared or not cleared with no further information. When a not cleared status arrives their is no information for the subject to actively challenge. This makes the challenge process much more difficult and costly. Having a list of charges would enable the agencies to make a more informed decision about the status of the subject. There are things that cause a not cleared status when a subject has no actual record and there are things a subject may have on their record that would have made them a bad choice to be with the vulnerable population but because it is not murder or a sex offense they still get a cleared status. It would be very valuable to our agency to be able to see a full list of charges. The vendors chosen by CNCS are significantly more expensive than the previously used services, this makes it financially prohibitive for our agency to add an additional search in order to obtain a list of charges.","1.a","2",,"4.b",,,"7",,,,"11",,,"Allow those without acces to VPs to have FP check initiated by start",,"POINT (-87.400417 39.471056)"

Most are not computer literate and it took huge amounts of time to sit with each volunteer as they navigated through the applications. Working with new applicants (strangers) is even more difficult. All they see is lots of intimidating pages on a screen asking for intimate details of their life instead of one friendly form requesting permission for access to the same that they can sign with an ink pen. 2) Cost: The cost of NSOPW as well as our state checks are free. The cost of using the approved vendors has been $61 each and I believe it has gone up since we last used it. Previously we paid $44 per volunteer 3) Lack of complete and viewable information: It has already been mentioned in earlier comments, but the pass/no pass system is not a good option. We used to receive full reports both from our state and fingerprint checks. It gave us the opportunity to know whether this applicant was being truthful with us, what kind of issues they have had in the past, and if those issues are relevant to the volunteer position. The reports we receive from the mandated vendors tell us nothing about the applicant other than whether they are convicted murderers or sex offenders. The schools often run a separate check and can come up with details that we have no knowledge of which doesnt look good for the program. Some of the proposed rule works well for us. My Foster Grandparents are centrally located and the Fieldprint office is easy to get to. It costs about the same price as the former fingerprint vendor, and we just need to alter our procedures to avoid the $17 recharge for persons who dont follow through. I put in a policy long-ago that no one even starts training without all background checks being performed, so that part works for us.

I appreciate the TrueScreen adaptions that have greatly improved the NSOPW check for grantees. The double entry of the volunteer name virtually eliminates the risk of an incorrect name being entered. That is the reason we have chosen to continue to use TrueScreen for NSOPW checks and pay for these checks rather than do them free on the website. Making the FieldPrint mandatory for FBI fingerprint checks will create an additional burden in time and cost to the enrollment of volunteers for the following reasons: 1. We do not get a full FBI rap sheet on the volunteer. Even if a volunteer clears with an ok from FieldPrint, there may be convictions on the record that would disqualify a volunteer based on our agency criteria. 2. Our Utah State BCI includes an FBI fingerprint check and we do receive a full rap sheet. During the re check of all our volunteers, we did find inconsistencies between the Fieldprint state records and our BCI records. Because of this we have elected to continue doing the Utah state and FBI checks through our state repository. We have resolved the issue of sharing results with CNCS audit staff. 3. If a ""not cleared"" result is found, the volunteer would need to request the record in order to determine if he/she was eligible to serve. This will add additional time to the process. 4. If FieldPrint is a mandatory check it will increase our costs of background checks. We would elect to do both the FieldPrint check and our State BCI/FBI check.

First, I note that, while over one million Americans have served in AmeriCorps since its inception in 1993, to my knowledge, not a single one has been convicted of a felony and/or a sex crime that was committed while on duty in their AmeriCorps service. In contrast, according to the FBI, in 2018, out of every one million Americans, about 3,680 commit violent crimes. Thus, the rate of criminality in the AmeriCorps program is far less than in the United States population as a whole. While CNCS and its grantees need to comply with federal law regarding background checks, it is in the public interest to make the background checks as inexpensive and non-bureaucratic as possible. Consequently, we offer the following comments on CNCS criminal background check guidelines: 1) If CNCS directly conducts a complete background check of a person for VISTA service, NCCC service, or for any other purpose, if a future grantee or sub-grantee of CNCS wants to select that person for either a CNCS-funded service program or to be an employee in a CNCS-funded program, then the original CNCS direct background check should still be considered valid, and the grantee or sub-grantee should not be required to conduct its own, additional background check. The law requires that the human being have a background check conducted for them, not that each entity engaging with that human being conducts its own, duplicate background check 2) Federal law stipulates that any person who refuses to participate in a background check will be ineligible to be funded by a CNCS program. Therefore, it is slightly absurd to requireas is currently the case - that grantees or sub-grantees of CNCS document that people subject to the background check agreed to get such a check ""voluntarily."" If a person can't be hired or paid unless they agree to background check, that's hardly voluntary. 3) People with only episodic - or no - contact with vulnerable populations should not be required to be subject to more costly and time-consuming, fuller background checks. Given that there is no evidence that any AmeriCorps members with episodic contact with vulnerable populations have ever committed a sexual offense while on duty, added costs and bureaucracy in this regard are unnecessary. 4) People funded by very-short term CNCS programs such as 9/11 and MLK Day service activities should be exempt from background checks. Given how brief the activities funded by such grants are usually only one day), the risk from criminal activity is even less than the minimal risk in year-long programs. Furthermore, the federal funding for such grants is usually small. Therefore it makes sense to waive the background check requirements entirely for such grants.",,,,,,,"7",,,,,,,"5",,"POINT (-74.007228 40.713054)"

The comments that I'm sharing are concerns and points of interest that I think are useful. -Our Central Minnesota Foster Grandparent Program serves volunteers, ages 55 to 90 yrs.+ who are part of a large rural population. Our new applicants/prospective volunteers are frequently not computer savvy and many do not have computers/devices/smart phones or internet access. Many applicants who come into our program do not have email accounts. We find that if they don't have email accounts already, they don't want them and won't use them. We also find that if they don't own and/or use devices, they don't want them and many can't afford them. Many can't afford to pay for internet access. Requiring that potential volunteers create an email account for this one event, is an unnecessary step to ask -or expect- them to take. -Requiring our project to use these vendors will increase (and has increased) the time and mileage that our staff have to spend helping potential volunteers to apply. We have sites that are as far away from our office as 112 miles- one way. Our prospective volunteers may live even father away. A staff trip to assist a volunteer in completing the background checks will cost a minimum of 5 hours of staff time and over $135.00 in mileage reimbursement. If the volunteer needs to travel from their hometown to a vendor location and they do not drive themselves, it will require (and has already required) additional staff time and resources to get the applicant to the required location. -Police stations and county sheriffs' offices are much more accessible; using police stations and sheriffs' offices will continue to be time and budget friendly in our project's 16 county rural area. The True Sage and Fieldprint locations are typically many miles away from where our volunteers live. We've experienced volunteers needing to travel 2 hours from their homes in order to complete the checks using Fieldprint. These proposed changes undoubtedly ""propose additional expenses"" that will continually impact and challenge our budget needs in the future. Please realize these proposed changes impact the personal budgets of our low-income rural volunteers, as well. -Police stations and county sheriffs' offices are less rigid about having appointments for getting our applicants fingerprinted. Typically, they offer timeframes available for fingerprinting rather than strict appointment times. Many offices allow them to ""walk in"" and get fingerprinted. This is much more convenient and doable for them and our staff for a variety of practical reasons. -Police stations and sheriff's offices might occasionally reduce or even waive fingerprinting fees for our volunteers. They do not charge if fingerprinting is needed for the same person more than once. Fieldprint and True Stage do not reduce or waive costs for anyone. I believe there is a cost for those needing to get reprinted by them, or for those who may miss their scheduled appointments. A few dollars saved add up to many dollars not spent nationwide. -In our project we currently pay $40-$45 per background check. Fieldprint and True Screen would be approximately $55 per check. A few dollars saved add up to many dollars not spent nationwide. -We will need to purchase Ipads or devices for staff to travel with that would allow them the capability to have internet access, the ability to take pictures and upload them, and to complete the process you're proposing for each new volunteer. These increases in expenses will compound and impact our budgets. These changes will complicate the process of recruiting volunteers and possibly delay the start of their service with our project. The use of local police stations and county sheriffs' offices for fingerprinting works very well for our project's purposes of doing background checks for our senior volunteers here in rural Minnesota. Those offices are much more time friendly and budget friendly than using True Stage and Fieldprint in our large rural area. Offering background checks/fingerprinting through Fieldprint and True Stage can be useful as an option in some places, but it is impractical as a new regulation for most of our volunteers and for our project as a whole.

This is superior to having to operate through a third party vendor whose determinations we cannot verify. Additionally, many of the school systems we partner with, by law, must conduct their own background checks which surpass the CNCS requirements, in the past we were able to accept our partner's background checks. Now we must conduct our own checks in addition to the ones conducted by the schools. This is a duplication, resulting in unnecessary costs. For these reasons, I am opposed to this rule change.","1

In some areas it has been difficult to find transportation to local law enforcement for fingerprinting, let alone get them to a spot 1-2 hours away.","3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"POINT (-94.220114 45.504444)"

There are pitfalls with both companies. The proposed changes to the NSCHC process create significant barriers to service for potential members in rural communities. The approved channelers omit necessary information needed by program staff to make a determination of suitability for service. Truescreen completes the NSOPW and the state of residence and state of service checks. Our current method allows SOS & SOR checks directly through a CNCS approved repository. Charges and convictions are shared in the results. Truescreen does not give access to this information. Rather, they make a determination for eligibility based solely on CNCS guidelines. Our program provides direct service to a vulnerable population. CNCSs guidelines provide a baseline for our suitability determination. Information indicating including abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable individuals would make an individual unsuitable for service with our program. Fieldprint uses Livescan locations or recommended alternate sites to initiate fingerprint checks of the FBI registry. Research of statewide Livescan and alternate locations reveal frustrating issues. Applicants need to search the approved vendor list based on their zip code. Locations are often farther than 30 miles from our rural service locations and the homes of some applicants. Traveling to a printing location is an investment in gas and time. In the case of alternate locations, applicants are often charged an unexpected additional fee for fingerprinting. Those applicants have to wait for reimbursement from our program. The process of reimbursing an applicant who is not chosen for service becomes more complicated due to additional paperwork not typically collected in the application process. In these situations an applicant is left with an unplanned expense. Fieldprint offers an option of mailing a fingerprint card to be completed and returned. Though a scanned result often takes 2-4 days, rolled prints require a convoluted path through mail delivery, arranging and keeping a printing appointment with an alternate print vendor and returning the prints. The best cases result in a 2 week turn around. Our experience is that is can take up to 2 months. This wait time creates problems for our applicants, service partners and training. Late enrollments require changes to the length of service terms at best or create a situation where a member cannot complete the service, or requires a grant extension. The proposed rule does not make it clear whether service members who will turn 18 during their service term must have a complete NSCHC, or what the time frame is for completing the NSCHC. The proposed rule will exclude rural citizens from service. Additionally, it does not offer enough flexibility to ensure our programs are NSCHC compliant and meeting our responsibility to protect the vulnerable populations we serve.","1",,"3",,,,,,,,,"12",,,,"POINT (-84.876417 38.207497)"

In reviewing the proposed rule, my feedback is as follows: 1) I do not recommend requiring the use of a single vendor particularly a private/for-profit vendor for all grantee/sub-grantee programs. My program has fully complied with CNCS requirements for the NSCHC procedure using a state repository. Our state repository makes the process very simple and all my covered positions are cleared prior to their work/service start date, which eliminates our need for accompaniment. I am aware of the current CNCS-approved vendors. Not only are they more expensive, there are insufficient LiveScan (fingerprinting) sites and staff to efficiently accommodate the number and geographic placements of all my covered positions who undergo this process each year. Also the vendors clearance is not detailed enough for us to make a fully informed determination of a persons suitability to work/serve. If grantee/sub-grantee programs can successfully adhere to CNCS requirements via a state repository, we should be permitted to continue using our repository. 2) A consistent requirement for checks regardless of recurring vs. episodic access to vulnerable populations may eliminate confusion and/or incorrect presumptions. 3) Although I recognize CNCSs attempt to eliminate the confusion and noncompliance related to accompaniment, requiring programs to complete all components of the NSCHC before the first day of work/service may pose a challenge. Some programs are not notified of funding until days before the start of their program/grant period. Unless CNCS plans to confirm all awards in the grants management system months earlier than current practices, then programs should retain some level of flexibility.","1","2","3","4",,,,,,,,"12","1","1","MO","POINT (-92.322488 38.93655)"

This is superior to having to operate through a third party vendor whose determinations we cannot verify. Additionally, many of the school systems we partner with, by law, must conduct their own background checks which surpass the CNCS requirements, in the past we were able to accept our partner's background checks.

We believe CNCS should not create a monopoly in favor of certain vendors, ensuring they will receive 80,000 transactions a year without competing with other vendors. Monopolies generate poor services and high fees. The list of vendors should provide options for performing the actual fingerprinting within a reasonable distance, meaning that each service location should have a vendor office within 10 miles to send the potential members/staff. Also, the current selected vendor Truescreen provides a deficient financial transactions report, that prevent organization from matching a transaction on the credit card report with a particular individual who run his/her background check. All approved vendors should be mandated to provide automatic and friendly financial transactions reports that would be validated by the Office of the Inspector General. CNCS may ask the OIG for an opinion on the current financial reports provided by Truescreen. Finally, in addition to the clearance/no clearance result, the background check report that programs get should include the entire list of offences the individual may have committed. For example, financial education programs would prefer to know to know if an individual have done identity theft and other financial frauds.

I very much support the idea of completing checks before service begins, but only if the use of approved vendors is not required and only if CNCS can ensure that grants are awarded early enough to ensure reasonable time to complete checks. I do not support the required use of specific vendors, especially the required use of Truescreen and Fieldprint. My AmeriCorps program is based at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in Baltimore, MD. The college has a more rigid background check process then Truescreen and Fieldprint upholds. Requiring the use of Truescreen and Fieldprint reduces public safety by forcing programs to trust a cleared finding with no information about criminal background. It is not acceptable to require us to operate through a third party vendor whose determinations we cannot verify. Because of this, we must report on the substantive findings. This doubles the administrative burden and is a waste of public dollars.There is a significant barrier to members getting to Fieldprint locations. Many of our members do not have access to transportation and must rely on the my program or others to get them to FP locations. We have been using a more affordable and accessible fingerprinting service, and we would like to continue to do so. When using Truescreen to conduct out-of-state checks, we have noticed that the findings do not match those of the state repository. Truescreen does not share its process or sources. This leaves my program with irreconcilable differences between checks and with reduced confidence in the information provided by TS. An issue that affects my program the most is that my AmeriCorps members are serving in Baltimore City Public Schools, and the public school system requires a fingerprinting background check through the Maryland State Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Fieldprint does not run their background checks through the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) of the state of Maryland. Therefore, again, all of my members will be required to complete another fingerprinting background check in addition to Fieldprint. This will also waste federal dollars. My Partner AmeriCorps Programs in Maryland that engage individuals who are likely to have a criminal record have determined that members are eligible to serve even if Fieldprint gives them a not cleared result. In each case, the not cleared appeared to come from FP mistakenly attaching something on the individuals rap sheet to perhaps being on the NSOPW. But program staff dont know, because they cannot see the results. In the meantime, these programs and members are flagged for extra monitoring. This is a perfect example of discriminatory impact. As AmeriCorps struggles with recruitment and should be an ideal opportunity for people with a criminal record to start fresh/give back, this is extremely problematic. Finally, the multiple website interfaces with Truescreen and Fieldprint are overly complicated. The websites are visually busy, archaic and not at all intuitive. We would greatly appreciate if Truescreen and Fieldprint did NOT become required background check vendors for the NSCHC. We would like the ability to continue using the background check vendors that our program has successfully used for the last 15 years.
