The mission of Fire Safe Council of Nevada County (FSCNV) is to provide fire wise education and programs to enhance emergency preparedness for wildfire to all citizens of Nevada County to reduce the loss of life, property, and natural resources. The FSCNV plays an essential role in bringing partners together to efficiently combine resources to increase fire preparedness and hazard mitigation in the comprehensive approach of the national wildland fire cohesive strategy.

Wildfires are an ever-growing threat in California, and a majority of Nevada County has been ranked by CAL Fire as high or very high risk of catastrophic fire. Many of the homes, and the town center, meet the criteria for being in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). This puts communities, water supplies, the economy, and ecosystems at risk. Nevada County also has a high degree of retired and elderly residents that are challenged in making their homes firesafe, especially low-income seniors. Additionally, catastrophic wildfires can greatly impact the economy. The FSCNC serves as a hub in the county to increase preparedness for wildfires and mitigate potential catastrophic effects across all of these overlapping needs.


AmeriCorps has partnered with the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County to help make Nevada County safer from catastrophic wildfires through fire safety projects and education.  The AmeriCorps members will support fuels reduction around the county, including along evacuation routes and for elderly homeowners in creating defensible space. Additionally, the team will help Sierra Friends Center recover from the Jones Fire with rebuilding projects at camp. And finally, the team will support local food banks and meals on wheels programs, that are responding to the ongoing pandemic. The project is expected to benefit the entire community by creating a more fire resilient and fire educated community. As well as help the community recovery from past wildfires and the current pandemic.",95652,"Grass Valley, CA

AmeriCorps NCCC has partnered with Food Bank of Alaska (FBA) to understand the unduplicated count of the clients served as well as the metrics of who exactly are being served. Implementing Service Insights (SI), a data collection program, should lead to improved effectiveness of current programs and will inform about the gaps that may exist, particularly in serving BIPOC and underserved populations. Broad data collection will help the food bank to understand what additional stakeholders and new partner agencies are needed to address the root causes of hunger that the clients are experiencing. 

Also important to future work as described above is the ability to secure adequate funding. Foundations and corporations are increasingly requesting various client information and making funding decisions based on these metrics. Implementing SI will allow them to provide some or all client metrics, improving the food bank’s ability to seek additional and new funding sources. The SI program will contribute to the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion efforts described in the food bank’s new 3-year strategic plan. Finally, the client understanding gained through SI will lead to more informed advocacy efforts, which should in turn further address the root causes of hunger in Alaska.

The BLM has about 10,000 employees, most of whom are in the 12 western states. The 245 million surface acres managed by the BLM were once called ""the land nobody wanted"" because 19th-century Western settlers -- the homesteaders -- had passed it by. That is no longer true.

The California State Office is located in Sacramento and employs about 900 people in the 15 field office locations throughout the state. BLM California manages about 15.2 million acres of public lands, nearly 15% of the state's land area. The Bureau also administers over 47 million acres of subsurface mineral estate underlying federal surface land, 2.5 million acres underlying privately owned land, 592,000 acres of Native American tribal land where BLM has trust responsibility for mineral operations. BLM California also manages 1.6 million acres in northeastern Nevada for cattle grazing, wild horses, recreation and wildlife habitat.

The lands managed by BLM are located within 50 miles of most major urban areas and encompass many ecosystems. Mountain ranges, chaparral lands, sand dunes, sagebrush plains, high desert, rushing mountain rivers, statuesque redwood trees, riparian oak forests, wetlands and the rugged Pacific coastline offer exceptional recreational endeavors, renewable energy sources, oil and natural gas, cattle grazing and wildlife habitat for more than 800 species of plants and animals.
