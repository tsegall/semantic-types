These programs ultimately save consumers money while preventing adverse effects on their service.  Honeywell’s thermostats are utilized by a variety of optimization/DR firms that access our thermostats through APIs. Set points can be continuously optimized for a number of factors including real time weather and a home’s thermodynamic properties, resulting in additional energy savings.  Similarly, our thermostats can be controlled by multiple Demand Response Management Systems (DRMS) systems shedding load at peak periods.  Features include pre-cooling and various shed strategies (cycling, temperature off-set, etc.).  Our UI and apps allow for consumers to be alerted of events and offer the ability to opt out should the need occur. Feedback on an event’s opt-outs, overrides and load shed performance are available through API to the Load Managing Entity.","","2013-02-28T00:00:00.000","2018-04-24T00:00:00.000","United States, Canada","ES_1020554_TH8321R***_03282018162431_6027643"

Our thermostat has participated in demand management via load dispatch, as well as time-of-use pricing response. The S100 thermostat offers a robust set of RESTful APIs to partners, allowing for straight-forward integration. Available for partner use are both a “Thermostat API Specification” and “DR API Specification,” offering server-to-server communications specific to general thermostat control, and demand response control, respectively.EcoFactor supports locational DR, allowing users to create “groups” based on segmenting features. Zip code is the primary characteristic used for segmentation, but custom groups are also possible. As an OpenADR member, EcoFactor is committed to openness and interoperability.EcoFactor reports run-time and thermostat performance at minute intervals, allowing for detailed measurement and verification of performance, including measurement of overrides. EcoFactor also records the type of HVAC equipment controlled by thermostat and continuously measures and records indoor and set point temperatures. Thermostat customers receive detailed reporting on thermostat run- time and savings versus baseline.EcoFactor is a leader in creating smart optimization, allowing for users to receive both energy efficiency– resulting in 10-15 percent annual savings on HVAC use – as well as optimized demand management, which prioritizes comfort through approaches such as pre-cooling and in-event cycling. Events can be configured by DR program managers including timing, duration, degree of cycling/offset, load shaping, and grouping. The S100 is largely compliant with 2016 CEC Title 24, Part 6 Joint Appendix 5, with the exception that the S100 does not have a physical expansion port.","","2016-01-01T00:00:00.000","2017-04-26T00:00:00.000","United States, Canada","ES_1096966_simple S100_04252017141009_2948266"
