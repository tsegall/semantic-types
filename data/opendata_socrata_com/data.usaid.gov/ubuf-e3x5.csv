The team interviewed over 120 individuals involved in Afghan politics in five cities across the country.  The team found that Afghanistan has significant traditions of democracy, some of which are long standing. Others, such as the past decade's electoral cycles, are more recent. The full expression of these traditions was found to be hampered by violence, corruption, and local interpretations of Islam that discourage questioning of many cultural norms and power structures and prevent the full participation of women in politics.","The assessment team found that the development of political organizations, whether parties or otherwise, was constrained both by Afghan and international programmatic factors. On the Afghan side, a failure of rule of law and Afghan governance gave Afghan political organizations little reason to develop beyond patronage-based organizations and therefore encouraged corruption. Further, the lack of effective and empowered elected government institutions at the local level, exacerbated by the failure to establish the elected sub-national elected government structures mandated by the Afghan constitution, left a gap between Afghans and their highly centralized, Kabul-based government. On the programmatic side, the team found that implementers targeted political party development programs at those with little reason to support change, ignored elected officials, were Kabul-centric, were poorly coordinated, did
not address political issues with elected officials, focused on form rather than function of political entities, and were supported inconsistently.

The system connected government agencies to each other and to businesses, banks, and citizens, permitting public access to most information and restricting access where confidentiality was required. After implementation of the National Registration Center in Tirana and networked service windows in 11 municipalities, the registration of new businesses required only one application, processed within 24 hours at a cost of about one U.S. Dollar. The National Registration Center (NRC) and its service windows throughout Albania processed nearly 85,000 applications and registered more than 18,000 new businesses in the first year of operation. The public can access all business registration data electronically through the NRC website. The project team built and tested an economic procurement system. Central government agencies and municipalities could then post tender notices on a public website from which firms download bidding documents free of charge and submit bids via an e-procurement system that meets European Union (EU) standards. Infrastructure and technical assistance was provided to the National Agency for Information Society (NAIS), and operational control of the e-governance service center was handed over to NAIS under a transfer agreement.

JSDP's innovative Model Courts Initiative, which evolved into the European Standards Program, helped 32 courts implement rigorous court improvement plans. JSDP partner courts introduced new records management systems and computerized case management systems. It remodeled courthouses to make them more accessible to the public and improved public relations and customer service. The BiH Ministry of Justice developed into a state ministry that is much more capable of carrying out its mandate. JSDP training in public finance, human resources, and project preparation and public relations helped the MOJ become an effective ministry, improving its work in justice sector strategic planning and policy-making, budgeting and finance, and donor coordination and European integration. JSDP helped the MOJ in the development of the first national Justice Sector Reform Strategy and assisted MOJ in the implementation of three of its main sections, which aim at enhancing the independence and efficiency of the judiciary, access to justice, and coordination in the justice sector. JSDP provided computer software to upgrade management of international legal assistance cases and helped the MOJ develop a central database on serious criminal offences to better track serious offenders.

The project provided technical assistance under the rule of law component to strengthen the Attorney General's Office, the Public Ministry, the Supreme Court and the trial courts, as well as the executive branch's system of public defense lawyers. The goals were to raise the caliber of officials and speed administrative and legal processes; provide training for judges and administrators to produce a more professional and qualified corps of justice sector professionals; support civil society organizations to assess and advocate passage of new laws; monitor implementation of justice sector reforms; increase access to justice for the poor and disenfranchised; and improve the legal framework for rule of law and justice sector reform. The latter included assisting in passage of needed laws and regulations to the criminal procedure and penal codes; civil service law and other career laws, such as the public ministry career law; codes related to the national police and criminal investigation; national public defense system; ombudsman; public administration law; and alternative dispute resolution law.  
Both components were designed to strengthen civil society organizations and the media to increase public awareness and demand for justice reform and accountability.

This assessment is the first of a series that will apply an analytical framework developed in DCHA/DG.1 The assessment begins by identifying salient features of the Indonesian context and tracing the historical evolution of decentralization in the country. This allows for an appreciation of the goals that prompted the government to engage in decentralization reform. Section 2 of the assessment identifies the key decentralization deficits that continue to confront reform by examining the four principal characteristics of Democratic Decentralized Local Governance (DDLG), namely authority, autonomy, accountability, and capacity. This leads to an identification of the range of constraints that might be addressed by an assistance program. Section 3 then examines the feasibility of various types of reform by utilizing a political economy optic that identifies the key actors and the interests that condition their perspective on decentralization reform. Distinguishing winners and losers from decentralization helps to gauge the likely support for and opposition to various paths of reform. Section 4 delves into the three institutional arenas in which the decentralization process plays out - the national, subnational, and civil society arenas.","The project results aim to provide next steps on decentralization in Indonesia. The recommended strategic approach is for a local governance program to concentrate on the promotion of autonomy and accountability. The autonomy objective would seek to improve service delivery in select sectors, increase community participation in setting visions and planning, and enhance the collection of own source revenues. The best way for the central government to support autonomy for local governments is to grant them the right to assess and collect taxes with significant potential for expansion, and to encourage them to bargain with local businesses and ordinary citizens to gradually ratchet up taxes and fees in exchange for better services and more favorable policies. Secondly, the Mission strategy would ideally focus on improving the accountability of local government, specifically in regards to transparency and oversight of service delivery in select sectors.",,"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnadq231.pdf",,,,,,,"High Corruption","Unstable"

The Health Systems 20/20 approach tackles both the demand (work with citizens and oversight entities inside and outside of government to enhance capacity to exercise voice) and the supply-side (strengthening the MOH and other health sector actors). Governance problems that confront health systems are often vaguely defined and poorly understood. Because rules and institutions exist from the global to the local level, governance issues are interconnected and complex. For example, corruption may derive from a combination of international financing mechanisms and local financial management practices. Weak engagement of citizens in health policy dialogue can result from lack of capacity of civil society and limited incentives or capacity of ministries of health (MOHs) to share information and engage stakeholders. This is a global project.","The project was successful in improving equity in access to health care and in improving government stewardship of the health sector. The program managed to expand institutional capacity in the managerial skills needed while leveraging sources of support through collaboration of government and multiple external partners. Finally, the project managed to increase transparency through participation of multiple in country stakeholders, especially civil society groups.",,"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdacu412.pdf",,,,,"http://www.healthsystems2020.org/content/news/detail/85805/","http://www.healthsystems2020.org/userfiles/HSA-summary-of-modules-and-indicators_version-1_75_full21%281%29.pdf","High Corruption","Unstable"

Public institutions enhanced their ability to undertake transparent good governance practices, engage in a constructive dialogue with CSOs, and provide information in a cooperative manner.  Five project grantees developed 26 recommendations for better health services, enhanced local budgeting, and citizen involvement in local decision making. Moldovan journalists received pre- and post-publication legal services from the Lawyers for Human Right (LHR) hotline, gaining the necessary skills to prepare objective and responsible pieces on corruption issues; 70 journalists were trained in investigative journalism and over 100 investigative pieces on different corruption cases were prepared and published as a result of the three-track training.  Five independent expert evaluations on access to information reported positive trend in increasing access to information and government institutional transparency.  Media outlets made improvements in providing coverage of corruption issues, the credibility of the Moldovan media increased by 10%, and the media enabling environment improved through the Public Private Working Group (PPWG) that fostered joint efforts and intensified dialogue between journalists and public officials, culminating with the adoption of the Law on Transparency in Public Decision-Making.
