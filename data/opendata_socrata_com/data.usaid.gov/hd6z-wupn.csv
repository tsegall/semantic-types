OPIC achieves its mission by providing investors with financing, guarantees, political risk insurance, and support for private equity investment funds. OPIC services are available for new and expanding business enterprises in more than 150 countries worldwide.

As a development finance institution, OPIC makes investments that other private investors would not make, paving the way for other private sector capital to successfully enter emerging markets. OPIC's instruments are also more flexible than those of traditional investors, with loan tenors of up to 20 years and transaction sizes ranging from USD 100,000 to 250 million. Since 1971, OPIC has supported USD 188 billion of investment across nearly 4,000 projects in developing countries and emerging markets. OPIC projects have also generated USD 74 billion in U.S. exports and supported more than 275,000 American jobs to date. OPIC operates on a self-sustaining basis at no net cost to American taxpayers and has returned money to the federal government for 33 consecutive years. From 2006 to 2010, OPIC contributed over USD 2 billion to the federal budget.
