-------------------------------------------------------
Premier Tim Houston, cabinet ministers and Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs held their first joint meeting today, June 30, discussing a wide range of issues and building relationships.

“This is an excellent opportunity for the government to strengthen our relationship with the Mi’kmaq and work closely together on issues our communities are facing,” said Premier Houston. “A brighter future starts with a shared belief in each other, in our communities and in all Nova Scotians.”

This discussion focused on mutual priorities in healthcare, the environment, the education system, economic development and building communities.

“It is crucial our governments work together on the goals and priorities we have in common, but also that we build a relationship so that we can work respectfully, understanding that, at times, we may have unique positions on important matters,” said Chief Annie Bernard-Daisley, Co-chair, Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs. “Today is a great first step to building that relationship, and we look forward to continuing these discussions with our government partners.”

“Meeting with Premier Houston and the Nova Scotia cabinet is an important demonstration of our nation-to-nation relationship and an opportunity to discuss matters that help strengthen and build our relationship as treaty partners,” said Chief Sidney Peters, Co-chair, Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs. “We are confident that these discussions will be the initial steps to a co-operative path forward.”

Quotes:
“Through my visits to Mi’kmaw communities and meeting M’ikmaw leaders and community members, I have deepened my learning about the opportunities and challenges we share. As Nova Scotians, we are all treaty people and have a role to play in advancing reconciliation.”
     - Karla MacFarlane, Minister of L’nu Affairs

Quick Facts:
-- the last joint meeting between the Mi’kmaw Chiefs and cabinet was held in December 2017
-- last September, Nova Scotia announced that September 30 will be recognized annually as Truth and Reconciliation Day
-- the Mi’kmaw Language Act recognizing Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s first language was passed by the legislature in April

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19, le 30 juin 2022","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19, le 30 juin 2022
--------------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale 1 491 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire, 28 hospitalisations et 4 décès liés à la COVID-19 au cours de la période de sept jours se terminant le 27 juin. Le nombre de nouveaux cas confirmés par un test PCR a légèrement augmenté comparativement à la semaine dernière, mais le nombre d'éclosions dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, d'hospitalisations et de décès a diminué.

« L'épidémiologie démontre que les personnes non vaccinées sont à risque considérablement plus élevé d'hospitalisation et de décès comparativement aux personnes qui ont reçu trois doses ou plus, affirme la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Lorsque nous comparons les groupes d'âge des personnes qui ont reçu trois doses ou plus du vaccin, les personnes de 70 ou plus sont plus à risque de subir des complications graves que les personnes de 50 à 69 ans. »

Depuis le début des vagues Omicron le 8 décembre 2021, l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées et décédées est de 71 et 81 ans respectivement. Trois des quatre décès causés par la COVID-19 signalés cette semaine sont des personnes de 70 ans ou plus.

Les données indiquent que l'âge est le principal facteur de risque de complications graves et que la vaccination est toujours efficace. Le risque d'hospitalisation est de 11,5 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est d'environ 117 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. Dans tous les groupes d'âge admissibles au vaccin, les personnes non vaccinées sont à risque plus élevé de complications graves comparativement aux personnes vaccinées. L'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel a été recommandée pour ces personnes au printemps. La plupart des gens de moins de 70 ans sont toujours bien protégés par une série primaire de deux doses plus une dose de rappel.

On encourage toujours les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui n'ont pas reçu tous les vaccins recommandés à prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir les vaccins contre la COVID-19 auxquels ils sont admissibles.

Jusqu'à présent, 65,9 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel, et 77 211 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel.

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Santé publique pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report for June 30, 2022","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report for June 30, 2022
--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 1,491 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 28 hospitalizations and four deaths during the seven-day period ending June 27. The number of new PCR-positive tests has increased slightly compared to the previous reporting period; however, long-term care outbreaks, hospital admissions and deaths have decreased.

“Our epidemiology shows that unvaccinated people have a substantially higher risk of hospitalization and death compared to people who have three or more doses,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “And when we compare across ages among those with three or more doses of vaccine, people 70 years and older are at a higher risk of severe outcomes than those aged 50 to 69.”

Since the start of the Omicron waves December 8, 2021, the median age of hospitalizations is 71, and the median age of people who have died is 81. Three of the four COVID-19 deaths reported this week were people 70 years of age or older.

The data show that age is the biggest risk factor for severe disease and that vaccines are continuing to work. The risk of hospitalization is 11.5 times higher for people 70 and older and the risk of death about 117 times higher when compared to those under 50. Within every age group for whom vaccine is available, unvaccinated people are at higher risk of severe illness than those who are vaccinated. Vaccine-related immunity wanes more quickly in people 70 and older, which is why a second booster dose was recommended this spring. Most adults under 70 are still well protected against severe illness by their primary series plus one booster.

Nova Scotians who are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines are still encouraged to receive all doses for which they are recommended.

To date, 65.9 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose, and 77,211 people have received a second.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations.

"Education and Early Childhood Development","School Year Ends on High Note for Staff, Students","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--School Year Ends on High Note for Staff, Students
----------------------------------------------------------------
Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, congratulated students and staff on another successful school year today, June 30, the last day of classes.

“Students and staff have accomplished so much over the last two years and I want to thank everyone for their efforts to educate and care for our children,” said Minister Druhan. “As the school year comes to a close, we can reflect on our school successes and appreciate everyone’s efforts to ensure students are recognized for their efforts.”

Prom celebrations and moving-up ceremonies, many of which were postponed or cancelled for two years due to the pandemic, have returned, and families are once again able to join with community to celebrate. 

Nova Scotia’s school system was able to keep students in school in person longer than most provinces. It also continued ongoing assessment of student success, which supports educators and leaders to identify student learning needs and target resources and teaching enhancements.

Minister Druhan thanked staff for their ongoing commitment to outdoor learning and said students will benefit from an enhanced focus on getting outdoors to learn and connect with nature. 

The government promoted healthy living and lifestyles through efforts such as the Healthy Schools Grant, which funds programs and activities that support mental and physical health and cultural awareness.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, félicite les élèves et le personnel pour une autre année scolaire réussie, aujourd'hui 30 juin, le dernier jour d'école.

« Les élèves et le personnel ont accompli tellement de choses au cours des deux dernières années, et je remercie tout le monde pour leurs efforts visant à prendre soin de nos enfants et à les éduquer, souligne la ministre Druhan. En cette fin d'année scolaire, nous pouvons célébrer nos réussites scolaires et reconnaître les efforts des élèves et du personnel. »

Les bals et les cérémonies de fin d'année, qui ont souvent été reportés ou annulés au cours des deux dernières années en raison de la pandémie, sont de retour, et les familles peuvent maintenant se joindre à la communauté pour les célébrations. 

Le système scolaire de la Nouvelle-Écosse a été en mesure de garder les élèves à l'école en présentiel plus longtemps que la plupart des autres provinces. Il a également maintenu les évaluations continues des réussites des élèves, ce qui aide les éducateurs et les leaders à cerner les besoins des élèves en matière d'apprentissage et à cibler les ressources et les améliorations pédagogiques.

La ministre Druhan remercie le personnel pour son engagement continu à l'apprentissage en plein air et souligne qu'il s'agira d'un avantage pour les élèves de profiter du plein air pour apprendre et établir un lien avec la nature. 

Le gouvernement a fait la promotion d'un style de vie sain grâce à des initiatives telles que la subvention pour des écoles saines, qui permet de financer les programmes et les activités à l'appui de la santé mentale et physique et de la sensibilisation culturelle.

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Housing Developments Approved in Halifax Regional Municipality","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Housing Developments Approved in Halifax Regional Municipality
----------------------------------------------------
The Province is taking action to increase housing supply in Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) faster.

Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr has approved development agreements for two sites designated as special planning areas under the Housing in the Halifax Regional Municipality Act. These approvals will allow the development of more than 1,000 future homes for people of all income levels.

“Overcoming this housing crisis is going to take a unified approach, creative solutions and a willingness to do things differently,” said Minister Lohr. “Our population is growing, and these special planning areas are an example of how the elimination of red tape and working in partnership with HRM and the development community will help thousands of people access housing faster.”

One of the development agreements approved by the Minister is for a mixed-use community of up to 905 units on the former Penhorn Mall lands in Dartmouth. The proposed development by Clayton Developments Ltd. and Crombie REIT will include 860 apartments and 45 townhouses, as well as new parks, trails and an active transportation network.

HRM will receive 12 per cent of the appraised value of the site from the developer and will invest the majority of those funds in new or existing affordable housing and the rest in community art or cultural spaces. The appraisal process is not yet complete; however, it is expected to generate millions to be invested in affordable housing options at the Penhorn location or another site in HRM.

The other approval is for Armco Capital’s proposal to develop up to 150 lots at the Indigo Shores special planning area in Middle Sackville. To support the development, the Minister also approved an amendment to a by-law that limited development within the subdivision to 25 lots a year.

The projects are still subject to required permitting, fees and regulatory requirements as specified in the Housing in the Halifax Regional Municipality Act.

Descriptions and updates on the nine special planning areas can be found on the HRM website: https://www.halifax.ca/about-halifax/regional-community-planning/regional-plan/special-planning-areas

Quotes:
“We’re continuing to work closely with HRM planning and the development community, and we’re making great strides to get these homes built for Nova Scotians.”
     - Geoff MacLellan, Chair, Halifax Regional Municipality Housing Task Force

“Designated for growth through the Centre Plan, the Penhorn site increases vital supply of mixed housing and directs new funds to affordable housing options within the municipality. We will continue to work with all partners, from government, the development industry and the community sector, to build more affordable homes.”
     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality

“We are very pleased this project is moving forward. This approval allows us to begin construction this year versus next. We would like to thank the Province and HRM for accelerating the necessary work to bring quality housing to market sooner.”
     - Jason Brunt, President, Clayton Developments Limited

Quick Facts:
-- designating special planning areas where the Minister has authority for development approvals was a recommendation of the HRM Housing Task Force, and these projects support HRM’s growth strategy
-- the former Penhorn Mall lands and Indigo Shores are two of nine locations that were designated as special planning areas by the Province on March 25; the nine areas could see as many as 22,600 new residential units developed in HRM
-- the Province is investing more than $22 million to create more than 370 affordable housing units in the Southdale-Mount Hope special planning area in Dartmouth
-- the Province has invested $3 million in Coady’s Place in New Glasgow, which has 36 safe and affordable units for people on the cusp of homelessness
-- the Province has identified 37 sites from the provincial land inventory that are potentially suitable for thousands of units of housing

"Community Services","Increase to Nova Scotia Child Benefit","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Increase to Nova Scotia Child Benefit
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is helping Nova Scotian families with lower incomes by increasing their Nova Scotia Child Benefit effective Friday, July 1.

The benefit is a tax-free payment to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18. Depending on household income and the number of children, families will now receive as much as $1,275 per child annually, at least $350 more than the previous year.

“Safe and healthy children, youth and families are vital to building a stronger Nova Scotia,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “This is one more way we are helping families who need it most.”

The Nova Scotia Child Benefit is combined with the federally funded Canada Child Benefit and received by mail or direct deposit as one monthly payment. The increase will take effect on the next payment received, in July.

People are not required to take any action, as both the federal and provincial benefits are based on personal income tax returns. However, people are encouraged to file their income tax returns for 2021 if they haven’t already filed.

The Department continues to work with partners and experts to develop a comprehensive approach to addressing child poverty.

Quick Facts:
-- the Nova Scotia Child Benefit year runs from July 1 to June 30 and is based on income information from the previous taxation year
-- to be eligible for the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, families with children must have an annual adjusted family net income under $34,000
-- as of February 2021, there were 26,477 families in receipt of the benefit, representing 47,068 children

"Public Service Commission","2022 Pride Flag Raising in Halifax","PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION--2022 Pride Flag Raising in Halifax
--------------------------------------------------------
A symbol of Pride is waving over Province House today, June 28, in Halifax.

As part of Pride Month celebrations, Public Service Commission Minister Colton LeBlanc and Kevin Barrett, Co-chair of the Pride Nova Scotia Government Employee Network, raised the Pride flag in support of people who identify as two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex or asexual.

“Today, we reflect on the work we are doing and what more can be done to become a more welcoming, diverse and inclusive public service,” said Minister LeBlanc. “When people feel safe, valued and supported in their workplace, it creates an environment where every person has an opportunity to succeed.”

The Pride Nova Scotia Government Employee Network was established in March 2009 to create supportive work environments for all employees. The network is also supported by employees who identify themselves as allies and want to help put an end to discrimination.

The public service also has an action plan to improve diversity and inclusion.

Quotes:
“2SLGBTIQA+ people face transphobia and racism, from outside and within our communities. Through events like the flag-raising ceremony, the acknowledgment of systemic barriers and, most importantly, embracing the many identities within our community, we will build something everyone can be proud of.”
     - Kevin Barrett, Co-chair, Pride Nova Scotia Government Employee Network

“Meaningful action on diversity, inclusion and equity is a priority in our public service. A more diverse public service creates a more inclusive province.”
     - Laura Lee Langley, Head of the Public Service and deputy champion, Pride Nova Scotia Government Employee Network

Quick Facts:
-- the Pride Nova Scotia Government Employee Network has raised the Pride flag since 2010 to support 2SLGBTIQA+ rights in Nova Scotia
-- this year marks 10 years since gender identity and gender expression were added as protected characteristics under the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act

Lifeguard supervision at many Nova Scotia beaches will begin on Friday, July 1.

About two dozen beaches in 12 counties are staffed each summer. Beaches will be supervised daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Mavillette Beach in Digby County, which is supervised on weekends only.

Clam Harbour Beach in Halifax Regional Municipality is usually supervised, but a shortage of lifeguards means it will be unsupervised initially. Recruitment efforts are ongoing.

Most beaches will have lifeguards on duty until August 28. A list of supervised beaches and daily updates on conditions are available at: http://www.lifesavingsociety.ns.ca/index.php/nsls-home/beaches

"Premier's Office / Economic Development","Government Launches Nova Scotia Loyal Prototyping","PREMIER’S OFFICE/ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT--Government Launches Nova Scotia Loyal Prototyping
-------------------------------------------------------
The government is taking the next step in its commitment to create a new provincial buy local program and encouraging Nova Scotians to offer ideas and opinions on its development.

The program – Nova Scotia Loyal – is now in the prototyping phase. This phase launched today, June 28, and will include a team visiting stores and markets across the province this summer to research consumer behaviour and hear directly from Nova Scotians.

“Nova Scotia Loyal will be a buy local program like no other – a compelling call to action, highly visible and supported by a rewards program,” said Premier Tim Houston. “For it to have the greatest impact, we need Nova Scotians to buy in and help build it with us. The prototyping phase will give people an opportunity to tell us more about what it means to be Nova Scotia Loyal.”

In addition to the work of the prototyping team, the government will be working with retailers of all sizes and has also launched an engagement campaign to hear from people about Nova Scotia Loyal branding, including the creative look and feel. There will be a variety of ways to provide feedback, including in person, on the Nova Scotia Loyal website and on social media.

“We’re establishing Nova Scotia Loyal to build on everything that’s great about our province – and make things even better. This is about fuelling our local economy and boosting provincial pride,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development. “We are eager to hear from Nova Scotians about what they value most when it comes to motivating them to use their buying power here at home. This direct feedback will help us shape Nova Scotia Loyal.”

Implementing Nova Scotia Loyal – a first-of-its-kind buy local program – is an important part of the Economic Development Minister’s mandate. The Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Aquaculture are also playing a key role by supporting the implementation of the program.

Quotes:
“Masstown Market began buying locally grown and made produce and products over 50 years ago. What began as a collaborative practice of supporting local farmers and providing quality healthy foods to local communities is possibly even more important today. Supporting local businesses and working together through Nova Scotia Loyal can only help to improve Nova Scotians’ food security, protecting our communities and the businesses that supply them.”
     - Laurie Jennings, Owner, Masstown Market Ltd.

“We have ambitious goals when it comes to buying local – to have 20 per cent of all food purchased by Nova Scotians to be grown or produced in Nova Scotia by 2030. Nova Scotia Loyal will strengthen our foundational work in building the buy local file in close partnership with industry, retail and foodservice.”
     - Greg Morrow, Minister of Agriculture

“As a sustainable source of high-quality, healthy protein, local seafood has been a mainstay on kitchen tables all across this province for generations. Together, the fishing, aquaculture and seafood processing industries are well positioned to help deliver more local food to more families.”
     - Steve Craig, Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture

Quick Facts:
-- the goal of Nova Scotia Loyal is a 10 per cent shift in demand to local products
-- Davis Pier Consulting is leading the prototyping phase of Nova Scotia Loyal
-- accessibility and equity are key pillars in the prototyping research

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Mise à jour sur la dose de rappel contre la COVID-19 pour les 50 ans et plus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Mise à jour sur la dose de rappel contre la COVID-19 pour les 50 ans et plus
-----------------------------------------------------
Les gens de 50 à 69 ans en Nouvelle-Écosse pourront prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir une deuxième dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 dès la semaine prochaine, même si la Santé publique recommande d'attendre à l'automne.

La Santé publique recommande d'obtenir la deuxième dose de rappel à l'automne parce que le moment idéal pour une dose de rappel correspond à une augmentation de l'activité virale. C'est ce qui protège le mieux les gens contre une infection. De plus, de nouveaux vaccins qui pourraient offrir une meilleure protection contre le variant Omicron pourraient être disponibles. Toutefois, les gens de 50 à 69 ans peuvent choisir d'obtenir une deuxième dose de rappel plus tôt.

« Bien qu'il s'agisse d'un choix personnel, nous recommandons d'attendre à l'automne pour obtenir une deuxième dose de rappel, affirme la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Il s'agit de notre recommandation, car la première dose de rappel offre encore une forte protection contre les complications graves pour la plupart des gens de ce groupe d'âge. L'activité virale de la COVID-19 est relativement stable à l'heure actuelle, mais nous prévoyons une augmentation de l'activité en automne et en hiver, lorsque nous voyons généralement une augmentation des virus respiratoires. Le moment idéal pour une dose de rappel est plus près de la prochaine vague de maladie pour mieux protéger les gens contre une infection et contre des complications graves. »

Les gens de 50 à 69 ans peuvent recevoir leur deuxième dose de rappel 168 jours après leur première dose de rappel. Les vaccins de Pfizer ou de Moderna peuvent être utilisés comme deuxième dose de rappel. Les personnes qui ne peuvent pas recevoir un vaccin à base d'ARNm pour des raisons médicales peuvent recevoir le vaccin de Novavax.

À compter du vendredi 8 juillet, les gens de 50 à 69 ans pourront prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou par téléphone au 1-833-797-7772. Le service de prise de rendez-vous par téléphone est disponible du lundi au vendredi de 7 h à 19 h et le samedi et dimanche de 10 h à 18 h. Les rendez-vous pour les vaccins administrés dans les pharmacies doivent être pris en ligne ou par téléphone. Les vaccins sont également offerts à des cliniques sans rendez-vous.

Faits en bref
-- Le Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation a recommandé une deuxième dose de rappel pour les personnes de 70 ans et plus afin de leur offrir une meilleure protection pendant la vague Omicron au printemps dernier.
-- On conseille aux personnes qui ont attrapé la COVID-19 récemment d'attendre 90 jours à compter de l'apparition des symptômes ou après avoir reçu un résultat positif au test avant de prendre rendez-vous pour une dose de rappel.
-- On conseille aux personnes qui ne sont pas vaccinées ou qui n'ont reçu qu'une dose du vaccin d'attendre 56 jours à compter de l'apparition des symptômes ou après avoir reçu un résultat positif au test avant de prendre rendez-vous pour une première ou une deuxième dose.
-- Au 20 juin, 65,8 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Update on COVID-19 Booster Doses for 50+","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Update on COVID-19 Booster Doses for 50+
----------------------------------------------------
Starting next week, adults 50 to 69 years of age in Nova Scotia will be eligible to book a second booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine, though public health is recommending that people wait until fall.

Public health recommends getting the second booster in the fall because the ideal timing for a booster dose is closer to an increase in virus activity – that best protects people from infection. As well, new vaccines that may offer broader protection against the Omicron variant may become available. However, people age 50 to 69 can make the choice to get a second booster sooner.

“While the choice is ultimately up to the individual, we recommend people hold off from getting a second booster dose until the fall,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health.  “Our advice is to wait because the first booster still offers strong protection against severe disease for most people in this age group.  COVID-19 activity is currently relatively stable, but we expect that we will have a resurgence later this fall or winter when we typically see surges in respiratory viruses. The ideal timing for a booster dose is in close proximity to the next surge of disease to best protect people from both infection and severe disease.”

People aged 50 to 69 can receive their second booster 168 days following their first booster dose. Either Pfizer or Moderna vaccines can be booked for the second booster dose. People who cannot receive those mRNA vaccines for medical reasons may opt to receive Novavax.

Starting Friday, July 8, people aged 50 to 69 can book a vaccine appointment online at: https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling 1-833-797-7772. Vaccine scheduling by phone is available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Vaccines administered at pharmacies must be booked online or by phone. Vaccines are also available at drop-in clinics, where appointments are not required.

Quick Facts:
-- the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended a second booster be administered to adults 70 and older to increase protection during the spring Omicron wave
-- people with a recent COVID-19 infection are advised to wait 90 days from the onset of symptoms or a positive test before booking a booster dose
-- people who are unvaccinated or have only one dose of vaccine are advised to wait 56 days from the onset of symptoms or a positive test before booking a first or second dose
-- as of June 20, 65.8 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose

The Province is funding a solar energy generation system for the lobster storage facility at Eskasoni Cold Logistics.

The investment of more than $128,000 will support the development and installation of a 583-kilowatt ground-mounted solar energy system that will reduce overall energy demands and lower energy costs. 

“Nova Scotia is a national leader in fighting climate change. Transitioning to more renewable energy sources like solar power helps propel us toward our ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. This project is a prime example of how community-led projects can help us reach our collective goals,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health and MLA for Cape Breton East, on behalf of Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. 

This project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide training opportunities for community members in the installation and maintenance of solar energy systems. 

The federal government is contributing more than $1.1 million to the project while the Eskasoni First Nation is contributing more than $245,000. 

Quotes:
“Reliable infrastructure is key to building stronger and healthier communities. We are proud to partner with the Government of Nova Scotia and the Eskasoni First Nation on this important renewable solar energy project that will create a healthier environment and benefit the community for years to come.”

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Minister’s Statement on Support for Long-Term Care Workers","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Minister’s Statement on Support for Long-Term Care Workers
-----------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a statement from Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams.
-----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians deserve to know they will have the level of care they need as they age, and they will.

When the care needed is around the clock, no one is more committed to the well-being of our loved ones than the people who work in our long-term care facilities.

I know this because I had a long career in continuing care, and I am proud to have worked shoulder to shoulder with these dedicated and compassionate women and men.

That’s why today, on this Day of Action for Support Workers in Long-Term Care, I want to say how deeply grateful Premier Houston and I are for everything you do to support Nova Scotians living in long-term care facilities.

It takes an entire team of workers to provide exceptional care. We know care is more than what is provided by doctors, nurses and continuing care assistants.

Care includes making sure linens and buildings are clean; nutritious food is prepared, delivered and served; and activities are designed and delivered to ensure residents are engaged mentally and physically. It is making sure buildings operate properly, repairs are made as required and administrative functions are carried out.

All of this important work is done by housekeepers, laundry workers, food-service workers, cooks, maintenance teams, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, recreation teams, administration teams and so many other hard-working people.

We see the contributions you have made to protect vulnerable Nova Scotians from COVID-19 and for years before the pandemic.

You have earned our highest level of respect.

I know from working alongside you that you face many challenges in the work you do.

This government believes in open and fair collective bargaining. The place to discuss terms and conditions of employment, including wages, is at the bargaining table.

This government has made a serious commitment to improve healthcare, and this includes long-term care. This year alone, we have increased the budget for the Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care by $142 million. We are investing in recruitment, training, workplace safety, higher levels of care for our loved ones and so much more.

We are ready to try new ideas and work with you to find solutions to the challenges we face.

Thank you for everything you do.

Il s'agit d'un engagement clé pris en avril au moment du lancement du plan stratégique intitulé Plan d'action pour la santé.

« Notre système de soins de santé est complexe, et les pressions sur une partie du système ont un impact sur toutes les autres parties du système, souligne Michelle Thompson, ministre de la Santé et du Mieux-être. Ces changements ne se produiront pas du jour au lendemain. Mais en publiant ces renseignements maintenant, nous rendons des comptes aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et nous faisons en sorte que les changements nécessaires seront apportés et que le système sera amélioré dans les secteurs les plus importants pour les gens de la province. »

Les indicateurs sont publiés au https://novascotia.ca/actionforhealth (en anglais seulement). Certains indicateurs tels que les visites aux services d'urgence et le taux d'occupation des hôpitaux seront mis à jour quotidiennement. Les autres indicateurs seront mis à jour régulièrement dès que les données seront disponibles.

Les renseignements suivants sont publiés sur le site Web :
-- Statistiques sur le recrutement de médecins de famille, d'infirmières praticiennes et d'infirmières autorisées

"Health and Wellness","Action for Health Data Now Publicly Available","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Action for Health Data Now Publicly Available
-------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians will now have access to important, regularly updated healthcare data.

The Action for Health website now includes measures so Nova Scotians can understand how the Province is tracking and measuring progress on improving the system for patients and healthcare professionals.

This was a key commitment made in April when the Action for Health strategic plan was launched.

“Our healthcare system is complex, and pressure in one part of the system impacts all the others,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “Change won’t happen overnight. But by sharing this information now, we are holding ourselves accountable to make sure change happens and the system improves in the areas most important to Nova Scotians.”

The indicators are available at: https://novascotia.ca/actionforhealth . Some, such as emergency department visits and hospital occupancy percentages, will be updated daily. Others will be updated regularly as the data becomes available.

Information on the website will include:
-- recruitment numbers for family doctors, nurse practitioners and registered nurses
-- the percentage of Nova Scotians seeking a primary care provider through the Need a Family Practice registry
-- waitlists for home care and admissions into long-term care
-- the percentage of hospital admissions for people whose complex needs could have been better addressed with primary healthcare
-- patients’ experience with hospitals
-- employee satisfaction levels
-- ambulance offload times
-- emergency department visits and hospital admissions, discharges and surgeries
-- hospital occupancy percentages and trends over time.

Progress on individual action items included in the four-year plan to improve healthcare have also been added to the website.

Actions the government has taken to improve healthcare include:
-- hiring more than 350 registered nurses and licenced practical nurses at Nova Scotia Health and IWK Health, starting between January and September 2022
-- recruiting 160 new physicians between April 2021 and March 2022, a record number
-- expanding opportunities for licensed practical nurses to become registered nurses
-- expanding VirtualCareNS to give people access to primary care online
-- launching a recruitment campaign for healthcare workers
-- reducing red tape for physicians
-- investing $57 million to attract, hire and train more continuing care assistants, including offering free tuition for students, and opening beds more quickly for seniors
-- increasing continuing care assistants’ wages in the publicly funded continuing care sector by up to 23 per cent
-- setting up a paramedic working group to develop shared solutions
-- implementing the direct to triage policy across the province, which will allow paramedics to spend less time waiting in hospital with low-risk patients and more time available to respond to emergencies
-- creating the Health Equity Partnership table including the Province, Nova Scotia Health and IWK Health; its first meeting will be held in July, with a focus on developing a health equity framework, metrics and indicators
-- opening a new recovery support centre in Dartmouth for people seeking help with substance use or gambling
-- opening the province’s first mental health acute day hospital at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax.

Quick Facts: 
-- the Province’s 2022-23 budget is focused on solutions for healthcare and increases healthcare spending by $413.4 million to $5.7 billion
-- feedback from the Speak Up for Healthcare tour included 2,391 online forum submissions, 254 listening sessions, five roundtable discussions, 67 video pitches to the Premier, more than 200 comment cards and more than 60 email submissions

------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s agricultural exhibitions can get help reopening this year through an expanded provincial infrastructure program.

The $226,000 exhibitions program will now accept applications to cover some operating expenses, in addition to funding upgrades and repairs to grounds and facilities. 

“For this year, we are expanding the program to help agricultural exhibitions with eligible operating expenses so they can open fully for the first time since the pandemic forced closures in 2020,” said Greg Morrow, Minister of Agriculture.  “Exhibitions and fairs stage agricultural events enjoyed by thousands of Nova Scotians each year; it’ll be good to have them fully operating again.”

Agricultural exhibitions and fairs throughout the province help farmers connect and share industry information, raise public awareness about farming, and engage people in the challenges and opportunities of agriculture as a business and way of life.

Applications for funding from the Nova Scotia Exhibition Infrastructure Program must be received by August 1.

Quotes:
“The Exhibition Association of Nova Scotia, on behalf of its membership, would like to extend a sincere thank you for the flexibility shown in our funding program with the Province of Nova Scotia. Greg Morrow, Minister of Agriculture, listened and acted on the challenges we face in our recovery in 2022.”
     - Gidget Oxner, President, Exhibition Association of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- there are 13 exhibitions and eight fairs that are part of the Exhibition Association of Nova Scotia
-- agricultural exhibitions feature popular events such as barrel racing, 4-H days and livestock demonstrations
-- exhibitions generate agriculture awareness and education and benefit local rural economies
-- about 100,000 people attended exhibitions in their last year of full operations in 2019
-- funding applications and information about the Nova Scotia Exhibition Infrastructure Program have been mailed out to all exhibitions and fairs in the province

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report for June 23, 2022","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report for June 23, 2022
----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 1,420 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 37 hospitalizations and seven deaths during the seven-day period ending June 20. The number of new PCR-positive tests has decreased compared to the previous reporting period; however, hospital admissions have increased.

“It is encouraging to see that we have another week with decreasing COVID-19 activity,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We have learned a lot about this virus over the last two years. As the weather gets better, I encourage people to have gatherings outdoors where possible, continue to wash your hands, use cough and sneeze etiquette and, most importantly, if you’re sick, stay home.”

People 70 years of age and older continue to be at highest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. Since the start of the Omicron waves December 8, 2021, the median age of hospitalizations is 71, and the median age of people who have died is 81. All of the COVID-19 deaths reported this week were people 70 years of age or older.

The data show that age is the biggest risk factor for severe disease and that vaccines are continuing to work. The risk of hospitalization is nearly 11 times higher for people 70 and older and the risk of death about 115 times higher when compared to those under 50. Within every age group for whom vaccine is available, unvaccinated people are at higher risk of severe illness than those who are vaccinated. Vaccine-related immunity wanes more quickly in people 70 and older, which is why a second booster dose was recommended this spring. Most adults under 70 are still well protected against severe illness by their two-dose primary series plus one booster.

Nova Scotians who are not up to date on recommended vaccines are still encouraged to receive all doses for which they are eligible.

To date, 65.8 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose, and 74,159 people have received a second.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The full report is available here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

----------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale 1 420 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire, 37 hospitalisations et 7 décès liés à la COVID-19 au cours de la période de sept jours se terminant le 20 juin. Le nombre de nouveaux cas confirmés par un test PCR a diminué comparativement à la semaine dernière, mais le nombre d'hospitalisations a augmenté.

« Il est encourageant de voir que l'activité virale de la COVID-19 diminue encore une fois cette semaine, affirme la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous en avons appris beaucoup au sujet de ce virus au cours des deux dernières années. À l'arrivée du beau temps, j'encourage tout le monde à se rassembler à l'extérieur dans la mesure du possible, à continuer de se laver les mains, à se couvrir la bouche pour tousser et éternuer et surtout, à rester à la maison en cas de maladie. »

Les personnes de 70 ans ou plus sont toujours les plus à risque de souffrir de complications graves en raison de la COVID-19. Depuis le début des vagues Omicron le 8 décembre 2021, l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées et décédées est de 71 et 81 ans respectivement. Tous les décès causés par la COVID-19 signalés cette semaine sont des personnes de 70 ans ou plus.

Les données indiquent que l'âge est le principal facteur de risque de complications graves et que la vaccination est toujours efficace. Le risque d'hospitalisation est près de 11 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est d'environ 115 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. Dans tous les groupes d'âge admissibles au vaccin, les personnes non vaccinées sont à risque plus élevé de complications graves comparativement aux personnes vaccinées. L'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel a été recommandée pour ces personnes au printemps. La plupart des gens de moins de 70 ans sont toujours bien protégés par une série primaire de deux doses plus une dose de rappel.

On encourage toujours les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui n'ont pas reçu tous les vaccins recommandés à prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir les vaccins auxquels ils sont admissibles.

Jusqu'à présent, 65,8 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel, et 74 159 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel.

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Santé publique pour lutter contre la pandémie.

"Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Grants Support Upgrades to Community Facilities","COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE--Grants Support Upgrades to Community Facilities
----------------------------------------------------------------
Thirty not-for-profit organizations are receiving grants totalling $858,000 for repairs and upgrades to community gathering spaces.

The Community Facilities Improvement Program supports community-led projects to enhance public use of existing facilities, such as community halls, local museums and archives and performance spaces.

“Community facilities are places where people gather to share meals, enjoy the arts or celebrate local history and culture,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “These spaces contribute so much to community life in Nova Scotia and we’re proud to offer support to help them sustain and grow.”

The program is open to all not-for-profit organizations that serve their communities. Eligible projects include interior or exterior upgrades to kitchens, windows and roofing, which help the long-term sustainability of the facility and the development of groups that use it.

For example, the Freeport Community Development Association in Digby County is receiving $45,000 for critical repairs to two buildings that house the Islands Museum, the historical society and archives, an art gallery and a community newspaper.

Quotes:
“The Freeport Community Development Association has a mandate to foster economic and cultural development on Long Island and Brier Island and surrounding areas. We’re thrilled to receive funding from the Province to do much-needed repairs, including roofs, foundation work and more. The association relies on volunteers and without this help for capital improvements, damage would be done to artifacts at the museum and art in the gallery.” 
     - Katherine Feiel, Co-chair, Freeport Community Development Association 

Quick Facts:
-- through the Community Facilities Improvement Program, the Department will fund up to 75 per cent of an eligible project, to a maximum of $50,000

"Health and Wellness","More Doctors Choosing Nova Scotia","HEALTH/WELLNESS--More Doctors Choosing Nova Scotia
----------------------------------------------------------------
A record number of doctors chose to come live and work in Nova Scotia last year.

More than 160 physicians were recruited and started working across the province between April 2021 and March 2022.

“Through the collective work of our recruitment teams and many partners, more doctors than ever chose Nova Scotia last year,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “We are doing things differently and making innovative changes to improve healthcare for patients, doctors and all healthcare professionals.”

The previous three years saw recruitment totals of 130, 128 and 127 physicians, respectively.

Of the 163 doctors recruited last year, 75 are family doctors and 88 are specialists. They are working in communities across Nova Scotia.

Last September, one of the government’s first actions was to establish the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment to attract and keep doctors, nurses and other health providers. It is also working to eliminate barriers to recruitment and retention. The office works closely with Nova Scotia Health recruiters and other partners.

Other recruitment initiatives include:
-- international recruitment mission to Scotland, Ireland and London underway to meet with physicians, nurses and continuing care assistants
-- Come Home to Nova Scotia campaign launched in March to attract more doctors home to Nova Scotia
-- international recruitment mission to Singapore, Dubai and London in March to meet with nurses, doctors and continuing care assistants interested in coming to Nova Scotia
-- budget increase of nearly $10 million for physician incentives; two new programs created in March to recruit new doctors and retain graduates
-- a team of navigators established in January to connect doctors and other healthcare professionals with the information they need to support their move to Nova Scotia
-- a broader recruitment campaign aimed at attracting healthcare professionals launched in December 2021.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotia has been an incredibly welcoming place where our entire family has been made to feel like we are part of the community. I often tell friends and colleagues about Nova Scotia’s flexibility, culture of kindness and the amazing people we have met here. I am grateful for the support we have received from the medical – and larger – community.”
     - Dr. Hadiza Babatolu, family physician recruited from the United Kingdom and now practicing in Middle Sackville

“We are thrilled more doctors are seeing what we have always known – that Nova Scotia is a great place to live and work. Physician recruitment is extremely competitive, which is why we continue to think and work differently to offer doctors a one-of-a-kind opportunity.”
     - Dr. Kevin Orrell, Deputy Minister and CEO, Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

“I would like to acknowledge our entire recruitment team and all of our partners who came together with innovation and flexibility. This period saw our most intense travel and gathering pressures related to COVID-19, and we had to pivot our focus to what we could accomplish in a virtual setting – site visits, resident events, clinic tours, online information and digital marketing all contributed to this total.”
     - Katrina Philopoulos, Director of Physician Recruitment, Nova Scotia Health

Quick Facts:
-- there were 68 physician departures last year, resulting in a net gain of 95 physicians
-- recruitment efforts are continuing to fill 149 physician vacancies (as of May 31), which include 60 specialty and 89 family medicine doctors
-- recruiting and retaining doctors and other healthcare professionals were key themes heard during the Speak Up for Healthcare tour last fall

"Office of Addictions and Mental Health","Access to Hope and Healthcare, Op-ed","ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--Access to Hope and Healthcare, Op-ed
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health.
----------------------------------------------------------------
I’ve had the honour of serving as the province’s first Minister responsible for Addictions and Mental Health for almost a year now. I’ve had the opportunity to travel around the province and to visit with many who are working in our hospitals, in community clinics and in community organizations to support people experiencing mental health challenges – and I will continue doing so this summer. 

I, too, worked on the frontline as a registered nurse. Time and again, I’m inspired by the great work that is happening in the field.  

There will always be those who want to paint a dismal picture of the state of mental health and addictions care. This does nothing to help. I want those who are struggling to know they are not alone. Help is available. 

We know that there are challenges in accessing care and we are committed, as a government, to making the much-needed improvements. I know from first-hand experience that there are solutions, if government is willing to be bold and put in the work – and we are.

We need to do more for those who are suffering. We need to address the stigma that so often stops people from reaching out for help. We need to create a system where all Nova Scotians can get the support and care they need, whether or not they can afford to pay. And we need to provide access to early interventions and care that reflect the diverse experiences of all Nova Scotians.

We are committed to doing more and doing better. For example, we opened the province’s first acute mental health day hospital and recovery support centres, which are allowing Nova Scotians to get the treatments they need, close to their families and communities. 

The past two years have been tough on Nova Scotians’ mental health, and we must come together in response. These challenges are too big for politics. We must work together with compassion and hope, and a commitment to better care.

We need to lift each other up and ensure the right care is available to support us when we’re struggling, and to catch us when we fall.

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Statement on Auditor General’s Public Housing Report","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Statement on Auditor General’s Public Housing Report
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a statement from Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Prices are rising, housing supply is limited and access to safe, affordable housing is becoming more and more challenging for Nova Scotians. Each of us deserves a place to call home – and we know that some people need our help to make this a reality.

As the government, we owe it to all Nova Scotians to ensure we are managing our public housing units efficiently and effectively. While the issues did not develop overnight and we know there is much to improve, we are taking immediate action to make things better. 

We agree with the findings in the Auditor General’s report on the Oversight and Management of Government Owned Public Housing and accept all the recommendations.

We have made progress already on some of the areas highlighted and are working on plans to modernize operations so we can help more people and families. We are reviewing our policies and making changes to ensure consistency and fairness across the province. We have implemented a standardized application process across the various housing authorities and are making it easier for people to apply for public housing. 

We have also taken steps to reduce our wait-lists and decrease the turnaround time on vacant units, as well as put measures in place to confirm the eligibility of people waiting for our units. We are working to improve issues resolution for residents. Other actions will take more time, such as implementing a new client service and asset management system and establishing a new governance model.

Part of the response involves creating a new entity to provide independent oversight and governance for public housing as recommended by the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission. This entity will be accountable and solely focused on improving public housing for Nova Scotians from one end of the province to the other. 

We are committed to making meaningful change for Nova Scotians in need of public housing, including those currently living in our units.

"L'nu Affairs","Minister’s Statement on National Indigenous Peoples Day","L’NU AFFAIRS--Minister’s Statement on National Indigenous Peoples Day
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, June 21, is National Indigenous Peoples Day, a day to appreciate and celebrate the rich traditions and varied customs of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people throughout Canada.

The day provides us with an opportunity to learn more about Indigenous history, perspectives and culture and helps us build stronger relationships rooted in mutual respect and understanding.

It’s also a time to recognize the many contributions Indigenous people have made and continue to make across the country.

Here in Mi’kma’ki, we acknowledge and honour the First People of Nova Scotia, the Mi’kmaq. Mi’kmaw culture and heritage are woven into the fabric of Nova Scotia, making the province stronger and more diverse.

Since becoming Minister of L’nu Affairs, I have had the honour of visiting several of the 13 Mi’kmaw communities around the province. I look forward to visiting every community. By meeting M’ikmaw leaders and community members, including Elders and Knowledge Holders, I have increased my own understanding of our mutual challenges and opportunities. We all have a critical role to play in advancing reconciliation and helping build meaningful relationships.

Understanding Mi’kmaw ways of knowing and being helps connect us to our shared history – a history that we are learning about through initiatives like Treaty Education Nova Scotia. Through this work, a partnership co-led by the Office of L’nu Affairs and our Mi’kmaw partners at Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey, all Nova Scotians can learn the importance of our treaty relationship.

Identifying that language is an integral part of cultural identity, I’m pleased that the Mi’kmaw Language Act recognizing Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s first language was passed by the legislature in April with the support of all three parties. In 2021, our Province recognized September 30th as National Truth and Reconciliation Day for the first time to honour residential school survivors, their families and communities.

This year, on the day of summer solstice, make time to explore and learn about First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people in a way that enriches you. Whether it is reading a book by an Indigenous author, watching a film or listening to some Mi’kmaw music, attending a community celebration or learning about our country’s history, I encourage you to celebrate and recognize the heritage and culture of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada.

Let’s continue to walk the path of reconciliation together and understand what it means to be a treaty person.

Mawkina'masultinej (Maw-ginah-mahsul-dee-nedge); let’s learn together.

--------------------------------------------------------------
The new Little Narrows ferry was officially launched today, June 20, as the Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy to honour a well-respected leader who committed himself to serving the Mi’kmaq.

The late Grand Chief Sylliboy, a residential school survivor, promoted Mi’kmaw language, culture and spirituality and played an important role in advancing reconciliation.

“Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy served as the voice for his people for 25 years and led his community for decades. He was a steadfast leader, a wise mentor, and was highly respected by many,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “We are honoured to have our new Little Narrows ferry called after him.”

Grand Chief Sylliboy, of We’koqma’q First Nation, died in 2017 at age 76.

The Department of Public Works held a contest involving the We’koqma’q Mi’kmaw School in Whycocomagh and the Rankin School of the Narrows in Iona to name the new Little Narrows ferry. The successful submission came from Grade 8 student August Francis at We’koqma’q Mi’kmaw School.

The Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy ferry crosses Little Narrows between Inverness County and Victoria County.

Quotes:
“Grand Chief Sylliboy had a gift for building connections between individuals, and it is fitting to honour his legacy with a ferry that connects communities in Cape Breton. This tribute reminds us that one individual can have a significant impact through continuous engagement, compassion and empathy.”
     - Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc

“Nova Scotians rely on ferries every day to support their businesses, access essential services and get where they need to be. Launching a brand new, 15-car cable ferry in Little Narrows is great news for residents, ensuring they will have reliable access to this transit service for decades. Our Government is proud to support a more efficient and robust transit option for Cape Breton.”
     - Jaime Battiste, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Member of Parliament for Sydney–Victoria, on behalf of Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities

“A great listener. A master. A humble leader. An Indian residential school survivor. A living legacy. A husband, brother, father, uncle, godfather, grandfather and great-grandfather. As the little footsteps of children, survivors, Elders, Grand Council, family, friends, step onto the Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy ferry, let us take this time to honour and remember Grand Chief's spirit , his life, hIs leadership, hIs service and his love of our Mi'kmaw language.”

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Changes to Down Payment Assistance Program","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Changes to Down Payment Assistance Program
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is making changes to the Down Payment Assistance Program so that more Nova Scotians have an opportunity to buy their first home. The program provides eligible homebuyers with an interest-free repayable loan of up to five per cent of the purchase price of their first home.

“With the rising real estate prices and the increase in cost of living, home ownership has become more challenging and out of reach for many young Nova Scotian families,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These changes better reflect current market conditions and will help more people achieve the dream of home ownership.”

The most significant change to the program is an eligibility increase to the total maximum market value as follows:
-- Halifax Regional Municipality: $500,000 (up from $300,000)
-- northern and eastern regions (Cumberland, Colchester, Pictou, Antigonish, Guysborough and Cape Breton) and Yarmouth region: $300,000 (up from $200,000)
-- Annapolis Valley/South Shore: $375,000 (up from $200,000).

Other changes to the program include:
-- increasing the total household income eligibility to $145,000 across the province, up from $75,000
-- removing the sliding scale to provide five per cent down payment to all applicants.

Under these changes, the maximum down payment interest-free loan will be $25,000, repayable over 10 years. Repayment starts one month after the loan is issued. 

Quotes:
“From the initial launch of the program in 2017, realtors have been partners and advocates for down payment assistance. With the changing market in Nova Scotia, and the demand for housing continuing to rise, realtors are thrilled to see meaningful and impactful changes to the Down Payment Assistance Program. This program will allow more Nova Scotians to achieve their dreams of home ownership.”
     - Roger Boutilier, CEO, Nova Scotia Association of Realtors

Quick Facts:
-- since the beginning of fiscal 2022-23, 13 applications have been approved under the program
-- the residential average home price in Nova Scotia in May was $452,748, up from $360,181 in May 2021, an increase of 25.7 per cent (source: Nova Scotia Association of Realtors)

"Agriculture","Buzzworthy Funding Program Helps Blueberry Growers ‘Bee’ Successful","AGRICULTURE--Buzzworthy Funding Program Helps Blueberry Growers ‘Bee’ Successful
--------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing an additional $100,000 in the Blueberry Pollination Expansion Program to support blueberry growers who keep bees to pollinate their crops.

“Beekeepers’ pollination services are essential to the production of blueberries and other crops in Nova Scotia. To grow more blueberries, we need more bees to pollinate the plants – it’s that simple,” said Greg Morrow, Minister of Agriculture. “These additional funds help address a need and encourage growers to invest in keeping more hives.”

Blueberry growers may apply for funding to expand the number of hives they keep or purchase equipment to improve efficiency in their bee operations.

The program is one of 14 Canadian Agricultural Partnership programs now accepting applications for 2022. The partnership is a five-year federal-provincial-territorial cost-shared initiative that supports farmers and agri-businesses. In Nova Scotia, the annual investment is $7.4 million.

Quotes:
“Many indigenous bee species already contribute to wild blueberry pollination – but there aren’t enough to allow for dramatic growth in the sector. Many beekeepers rent their hives to provide pollination service, but demand is growing. This funding will allow more growers to maintain their own hives for pollination.”
     - Jason Sproule, Provincial Apiculturist, Department of Agriculture

“The wild blueberry industry appreciates the support of the Department of Agriculture to help expand the commercial pollination industry in Nova Scotia. To support the continuous growth of the wild blueberry industry, it is critical that the pollination industry grows with us in a sustainable and vibrant way.”
     - Peter Swinkels, President, Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia

“This program will allow for much-needed funds to assist our beekeepers to grow and expand and continue to meet Nova Scotia’s growing need for pollination services.”
     - Tyler Hobbs, President, Beekeepers Association of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- this is the second year for the Blueberry Pollination Expansion Program, and it now has a budget of $350,000
-- successful applicants are eligible for up to $100 per hive to cover beehive expenses and up to $50,000 for efficiency improvements between April 1 and December 31
-- eligible applicants must generate an annual eligible bee and/or blueberry-related gross commodity income of $30,000, be registered under the Bee Industry Act and be a member in good standing of the Nova Scotia Beekeepers Association
-- Nova Scotia has about 700 blueberry farms
-- Nova Scotia blueberry growers sold more than 22 million kilograms (49 million pounds) of blueberries in 2021, generating revenue of $39.2 million

------—---------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a statement from Public Works Minister Kim Masland.
----------------------------------------------------
Today, June 17, I am releasing the number of passengers who have travelled on the Nova Scotia-to-Maine ferry this season to date, which was provided to the Department late last night by Bay Ferries Limited.

The numbers are available at https://novascotia.ca/news/docs/2022/06/17/Year-to-Date-Ferry-Numbers-2022.pdf

In accordance with the 10-year contract entered into on March 31, 2018, between the Province of Nova Scotia and Bay Ferries Limited, Bay Ferries Limited is the manager and operator of this service. Under the terms of this existing contract, Bay Ferries is responsible for marketing the ferry, selling tickets and, ultimately, whether the service is a success or failure.

Our government feels very strongly that Bay Ferries owes it to Nova Scotians to be fully transparent about how the service is performing. We have requested that the operator provide daily updates on its website going forward, but the operator has declined. This is why we are providing these numbers directly today. If Bay Ferries will not be fully transparent, we certainly will be.

This government is bound to a contract entered into by a previous government. I want to assure Nova Scotians that I will do everything possible to make sure Bay Ferries Limited is transparent and accountable to Nova Scotians.

----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 1,950 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 28 hospitalizations and 10 deaths during the seven-day period ending June 13. The number of new PCR-positive tests is slightly higher than in last week’s report. However, hospital admissions and the number of deaths reported have decreased.

Starting this week, the number of lab-confirmed cases includes people who have COVID-19 for the second time or more. Reinfections were not previously included in data reports because the number was small. But with the emergence of the Omicron variant, reinfections have become more frequent, and that is why Nova Scotia will now include them in the reported lab-confirmed cases. This change is part of the reason for the increased case numbers this week.

“Since the beginning of the Omicron wave, there have been 215 people who have tested positive 90 days or more after a previous positive PCR test result,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “At this point, many Nova Scotians have tested positive for COVID-19, so the chances of reinfection become more probable; that is why we have shifted our reporting to include the number of reinfections in our weekly case count.”

People 70 years of age and older continue to be at highest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. Since the start of the Omicron waves December 8, 2021, the median age of hospitalizations is 71, and the median age of people who have died is 81. Eight (80 per cent) of the COVID-19 deaths reported this week were people 70 years of age or older.

The data show that age is the biggest risk factor for severe disease and that vaccines are continuing to work. The risk of hospitalization is nearly 11 times higher for people 70 and older and the risk of death about 112 times higher when compared to those under 50. Vaccine-related immunity wanes more quickly in people 70 and older, which is why a second booster dose was recommended this spring. Most adults under 70 are still well protected against severe illness by their two-dose primary series plus one booster. 
Nova Scotians who are not up to date on recommended vaccines are still encouraged to receive all doses for which they are eligible. 

To date, 65.7 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose, and 71,557 people have received a second.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The full report is available here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

---------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale 1 950 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire, 28 hospitalisations et 10 décès liés à la COVID-19 au cours de la période de sept jours se terminant le 13 juin. Le nombre de nouveaux cas confirmés par un test PCR est légèrement plus élevé que la semaine dernière, mais le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès a diminué.

À compter de cette semaine, le nombre de cas confirmés en laboratoire inclut ceux des personnes qui ont contracté la COVID-19 plus d'une fois. Les réinfections n'étaient pas incluses dans les données auparavant parce que le nombre était minimal. Toutefois, depuis l'arrivée du variant Omicron, les réinfections sont plus fréquentes, et c'est pourquoi la Nouvelle-Écosse les inclut maintenant dans le nombre de cas confirmés en laboratoire. C'est pourquoi, en partie, le nombre de nouveaux cas a augmenté cette semaine.

« Depuis le début de la vague Omicron, 215 personnes ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage 90 jours ou plus après un test PCR positif précédent, souligne la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse. À ce stage, de nombreuses personnes ont contracté la COVID-19, donc le risque de réinfection devient plus probable. C'est pourquoi nous avons modifié nos rapports pour inclure le nombre de réinfections au nombre de nouveaux cas chaque semaine. »

Les personnes de 70 ans ou plus sont toujours les plus à risque de complications graves en raison de la COVID-19. Depuis le début des vagues Omicron le 8 décembre 2021, l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées et décédées est de 71 et 81 ans respectivement. Huit (80 %) des décès causés par la COVID-19 signalés cette semaine sont des personnes de 70 ans ou plus.

Les données indiquent que l'âge est le principal facteur de risque de complications graves et que la vaccination est toujours efficace. Le risque d'hospitalisation est près de 11 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est d'environ 112 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. L'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel était recommandée pour ces personnes. La plupart des gens de moins de 70 ans sont toujours bien protégés par une série primaire de deux doses plus une dose de rappel.
 
On encourage toujours les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui n'ont pas reçu tous les vaccins recommandés à prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir les vaccins auxquels ils sont admissibles. 

Jusqu'à présent, 65,7 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel, et 71 557 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel.

“Nova Scotia is a special place and we are excited that more and more people see a future for themselves and their families here,” said Minister Balser. “Population growth is vital to our economic success. We have been preparing for growth, working with employers, communities and settlement organizations to get ready for more people to call Nova Scotia home.”

This year, the Province can approve a total of 5,430 applicants, up from 3,857 in 2021, to settle in Nova Scotia with their families.

This includes:
 -- an increase of 400 nomination spaces in the Provincial Nominee Program, 17 per cent more than last year
-- an increase of 1,173 endorsement spaces in the Atlantic Immigration Program, 75 per cent more than last year.

Both of the Province’s economic immigration programs, the Provincial Nominee Program and the Atlantic Immigration Program, are available to people who fill Nova Scotian employers’ labour needs and want a pathway to permanent residency. There are nine established streams under the Provincial Nominee Program, providing options for potential immigrants depending on their work experience, skills and occupation.

Quick Facts:
-- refugees and people arriving on the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel are not counted as part of this allocation
-- more than 500 people from Ukraine have arrived since February and are staying in Nova Scotia
-- the Atlantic Immigration Program, introduced in 2017 as a pilot program to help employers recruit skilled foreign workers and international graduates to meet labour needs, became a permanent program on January 1, 2022
-- Nova Scotia welcomed 9,025 new permanent residents in 2021, a record-breaking number that surpassed the previous high by 19 per cent
-- Budget 2022-23 included an additional $1 million for immigration and population growth marketing campaigns; $895,000 more for six new navigators and four new program officers to support newcomer arrivals and immigration programs; and $1.4 million more for settlement services in communities across Nova Scotia

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is designating Owls Head as Nova Scotia’s next provincial park. 

Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton announced today, June 14, the protection of 266 hectares of Crown lands at Owls Head in Little Harbour, Halifax Regional Municipality.

“The designation of this land as a provincial park is a clear indication of our promise to protect more land in Nova Scotia,” said Minister Rushton. “We are committed to transparency and giving the public an opportunity to provide input on how public lands are used, managed and protected.”

The Crown lands include a variety of coastal barrens and wetlands and exceptional bedrock-ridged topography. Owls Head is home to the piping plover and the barn swallow, two species at risk.

The Department will manage Owls Head as a natural park. The public will have access, but there will be no services, such as garbage collection, or facilities like washrooms and parking areas.

Quick Facts:
-- designating Crown lands as Owls Head Provincial Park furthers the Province’s goal of protecting 20 per cent of Nova Scotia’s land and water mass by 2030
-- the new park is made up of Crown lands totalling 266 hectares and includes three islands
-- some survey work and administrative steps are necessary before the designation is complete

"Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation","Year-End Results","NOVA SCOTIA LIQUOR CORPORATION--Year-End Results
------------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation (NSLC) released its year-end financial results today, June 14.

For the fiscal year April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022, total sales were up 3.5 per cent to $820.5 million, with an increase in both beverage alcohol and cannabis sales compared to the previous fiscal year. Beverage alcohol sales increased 1.7 per cent to $718.7 million, and cannabis sales increased 18.2 per cent to $101.7 million.

Earnings decreased 2.1 per cent to $268.7 million. Earnings were down due to increased sales of cannabis and local products, which both have lower margins compared to other products, higher payroll costs and increased freight costs.

Sales of Nova Scotia products increased across all categories. Local cannabis led the growth with a 40.1 per cent increase in sales to $23.6 million. Growth in other categories included:
-- beer – up 18.7 per cent to $26.4 million
-- wine – up 15.3 per cent to $15.5 million
-- spirits – up 12.2 per cent to $12.6 million
-- ready-to-drink products – up 5.1 per cent to $30.0 million.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Sustainable Forestry for Nova Scotia, Op-ed","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Sustainable Forestry for Nova Scotia, Op-ed
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians care deeply about their natural environment and about our collective efforts to ensure a sustainable, prosperous future for generations to come.

Part of that bright future for Nova Scotia is clean air and water, an abundance of biodiversity, spaces where we can connect with nature, climate change mitigation – and economic prosperity.  

From farming, fishing and forestry to our growing renewable energy sector, thousands of jobs, families and communities depend on the responsible and sustainable use of our natural resources, particularly in rural Nova Scotia.

To succeed, we must all recognize that environment and economy go hand in hand. Our government is committed to succeeding on both fronts.

That is why we are transforming Nova Scotia’s forestry sector. We are building the triad model of ecological forestry on Crown land as recommended in the independent review of forestry practices. This complex, integrated model balances many interests and will secure sustainability for our environment and our forestry industry. 

It ensures that more than a third of Crown land will always be conserved and makes more than half available for lower-intensity forestry that prioritizes biodiversity. A small portion will be allocated for high-production timber harvesting in areas where this activity won’t conflict with other interests. This is truly transformational for an industry that’s been a key driver of Nova Scotia’s economy for decades.

We could have advanced this work faster alone, but we believe our collaborative approach improves transparency, builds stronger relationships and achieves the best policy decisions and outcomes for all Nova Scotians. Our efforts to date are built on consultation and partnerships with industry, environmental groups, the Mi’kmaq, Nova Scotians and other stakeholders. I thank all of them for their input and ongoing involvement as we continue this work.

I also thank the dedicated staff in the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables for their focus and leadership in doing the research, analysis and consultation needed to put the pieces of this complex puzzle together. I look forward to giving an update on our progress soon.

"Agriculture / Education and Early Childhood Development","Government Covers Planned School Milk Price Increase","AGRICULTURE/EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Government Covers Planned School Milk Price Increase
-------------------------------------------------
Amid rising food costs, the government will cover a planned price increase in the School Milk Program to ensure milk stays affordable for families when students return to classrooms in September.

“The rising cost of food is a real challenge for many Nova Scotia families,” said Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow. “We know that our dairy producers and processors are seeing their costs rise, too. By covering the cost of the planned increase, we’re able to support the industry while giving parents one less thing to worry about when the school year starts again.”

The Natural Products Marketing Council, a sector-led adjudicative board, sets the price of school milk. There was a price increase scheduled for September 1, but the government has agreed to cover that cost so families don’t have to. That means the price of a 250-millilitre carton of milk at school will remain at 40 cents.

The cost of covering this increase is estimated to be about $72,000. This is in addition to current costs, which have ranged between $130,000 and $230,000 per full school year. These costs were lower during the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years due to pandemic-related school closures.

The School Milk Program is cost shared between the Department of Agriculture and dairy producers and processors. Since 1974, the program has provided milk at a reduced price to students in grades primary to 12 at participating public schools.

Quotes:
“Having access to healthy food options at school allows students to focus on learning. For nearly 50 years, this program has been putting nutritious, local milk in the hands of Nova Scotia students at an affordable price for families – which is more important than ever these days.”
     - Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development

Quick Facts: 
-- the government also offset a planned cost increase on school milk from January through June

----------------------------------------------------
En raison de la croissance du coût de la nourriture, le gouvernement prendra en charge une augmentation prévue des coûts liés au Programme lait-école de la Nouvelle-Écosse afin que le lait reste abordable pour les familles à la rentrée scolaire en septembre.

« L'augmentation du prix de la nourriture est une grande difficulté pour de nombreuses familles néo-écossaises, affirme Greg Morrow, ministre de l'Agriculture. Nous savons que nos producteurs et transformateurs laitiers sont aussi aux prises avec l'augmentation des coûts. En prenant en charge l'augmentation prévue des coûts, nous appuyons l'industrie tout en éliminant une inquiétude pour les parents à la rentrée scolaire. »

Le prix du lait est fixé par le Natural Products Marketing Council, un conseil juridictionnel dirigé par le secteur. Une augmentation des prix était prévue le 1er septembre, mais le gouvernement a accepté de prendre en charge ce coût pour permettre aux familles d'économiser. Ainsi, le prix d'un carton de lait de 250 ml à l'école restera à 40 cents.

Le coût lié à cette augmentation est estimé à environ 72 000 $, et il s'ajoute aux coûts actuels, qui varient entre 130 000 $ et 230 000 $ par année scolaire complète. Ces coûts ont été réduits pendant les années scolaires 2019-2020 et 2020-2021 en raison des fermetures d'écoles causées par la pandémie.

Les coûts du Programme lait-école de la Nouvelle-Écosse sont partagés entre le ministère de l'Agriculture et les producteurs et transformateurs laitiers. Depuis 1974, le programme offre du lait à un prix réduit aux élèves de la maternelle à la 12e année des écoles publiques participantes.

Citations
« L'accès à des aliments sains à l'école permet aux élèves de se concentrer sur leur apprentissage. Depuis près de 50 ans, ce programme offre du lait local et nutritif aux élèves de la Nouvelle-Écosse, et ce, à un coût abordable pour les familles, ce qui est plus important que jamais aujourd'hui. »
     - Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance

Faits en bref 
-- Le gouvernement a également pris en charge une augmentation prévue du coût du lait consommé dans les écoles de janvier à juin.

"Community Services","Small Option Home in Dartmouth Ready to Welcome Residents","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Small Option Home in Dartmouth Ready to Welcome Residents
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province continues to move people in the Disability Support Program into communities with the establishment of a new small option home in Dartmouth.

The renovated property, bright and inviting, will soon be home to three people living with disabilities. The fully accessible space features four bedrooms, two bathrooms and an outdoor living area and is situated in a well-established, residential neighbourhood. The home is funded and licensed by the Department of Community Services and operated by service provider New Vision.

“Everyone should be able to participate in our communities without barriers,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “This is another important step forward and I’m thrilled that three Nova Scotians will now be able to live and engage as part of a neighborhood, will have choice and independence and can pursue their goals.”

The Disability Support Program has been working to phase out large institutional settings over time and shift to community-based housing and support options.

There are currently 14 small option homes under construction in the province. Homes in Glace Bay, Stellarton and Lower Sackville are expected to open this summer. In the fall, four homes in Yarmouth, two in Shelburne, a second home in Stellarton, and homes in Sydney, New Glasgow, Digby and New Minas are expected to open.

To further support community living, the Province has committed $8.8 million this year to remove the cap on the Independent Living Support program. This program provides services to people who live in their own apartment or home and who require a minimal level of support. Over two years, this investment will allow the Disability Support Program to offer this additional support to everyone on the wait-list – more than 400 people.

Also, $3.5 million has been committed to move young adults with severe physical disabilities out of long-term care and into community placements as part of an ongoing effort to ensure people can live where they want to, independently. This initiative will support 200 people over the next four years to live in community.

Quotes:
“New Vision is honoured to be part of the Province’s investment to develop new capacity for community inclusion. The opening of this new small option home is an amazing opportunity for our DSP participants to have a home that meets their needs and be part of a beautiful community. We are very proud of this project and worked hard to deliver the home on time and on budget. We are excited to begin supporting residents next week!”
     - Yiwen Zhao-Walsh, Vice-President, New Vision Special Care Homes Ltd.

Quick Facts:
-- Budget 2022-23 invests an additional $54.2 million in programs that support people living with disabilities
-- there are currently over 300 community-based homes in Nova Scotia funded by the Department of Community Services
-- pre-approved designs for small option homes and a list of pre-approved builders are in development to expedite the construction process

« Mes pensées accompagnent les 21 familles qui ont perdu un être cher en raison de la COVID-19, affirme la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Cet été, bon nombre d'entre nous avons hâte de retrouver nos familles et nos amis, mais il est important de nous rassembler en toute sécurité afin de protéger les personnes les plus à risque. Rassemblez-vous à l'extérieur dans la mesure du possible, faites-vous vacciner contre la COVID-19 et restez à la maison si vous êtes malade. »

Les personnes de 70 ans ou plus sont toujours les plus à risque de subir complications graves en raison de la COVID-19. Depuis le début des vagues Omicron le 8 décembre 2021, l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées et décédées est de 72 et 81 ans respectivement.

Les données indiquent que l'âge est le principal facteur de risque de complications graves et que la vaccination est efficace. Le risque d'hospitalisation est près de 11 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est d'environ 125 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. L'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel était recommandée pour ces personnes. La plupart des gens de moins de 70 ans sont toujours bien protégés par une série primaire de deux doses plus une dose de rappel.

Jusqu'à présent, 65,6 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel, et 68 452 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report for June 9, 2022","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report for June 9, 2022
----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 1,474 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 49 hospitalizations during the seven-day period ending June 6. The number of new PCR-positive tests has decreased; however, hospital admissions have increased.

There were also 21 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system during this seven-day period, including two deaths that occurred last week. There is typically a delay in reporting deaths and the remaining 19 occurred between April 25 and May 30. Nineteen (90 per cent) of the 21 people were at least 70 years old.

“My thoughts are with the 21 families who’ve lost their loved ones to COVID-19,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “As summer approaches, many of us are excited to reconnect with family and friends, but it’s important we do so safely to protect those at high risk. Gather outside when you can, stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines, and if you’re sick, please stay home.”

People 70 years of age and older continue to be at highest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. Since the start of the Omicron waves December 8, 2021, the median age of hospitalizations is 72, and the median age of people who have died is 81.

The data show that age is the biggest risk factor for severe disease and that vaccines work. The risk of hospitalization is nearly 11 times higher for people 70 and older and the risk of death about 125 times higher when compared to those under 50. Vaccine-related immunity wanes more quickly in people 70 and older, which is why a second booster dose was recommended this spring. Most adults under 70 are still well protected against severe illness by their two-dose primary series plus one booster.

To date, 65.6 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose, and 68,452 people have received a second.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations.

"Health and Wellness","Nouveau projet pilote de modèle de rémunération des médecins de famille","SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Nouveau projet pilote de modèle de rémunération des médecins de famille 
------------------------------------------------------
Un nouveau modèle de rémunération des médecins de famille a été conçu pour encourager davantage les équipes de soins et permettre aux patients d’obtenir plus facilement les soins dont ils ont besoin, là et au moment où ils en ont besoin. 

Doctors Nova Scotia et le gouvernement ont travaillé ensemble pour élaborer le nouveau modèle qui sera mis à l’essai dans plusieurs cabinets de médecins de famille.

« Un salaire concurrentiel est un facteur crucial du recrutement et du maintien en poste des médecins qui vont s’occuper des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse, de dire la ministre de la Santé et du Mieux-être Michelle Thompson. Ce modèle de rémunération vise à mieux soutenir les médecins de famille et à améliorer l’accès des patients aux soins de santé. Nous sommes heureux de collaborer avec Doctors Nova Scotia et nous avons hâte de voir comment ce modèle peut nous aider à atteindre ces objectifs. »

Le modèle de paiement, appelé capitation mixte, versera une rémunération aux médecins de famille en fonction du nombre de patients qu’ils ont et du nombre de services qu’ils assurent. Les médecins peuvent aussi recevoir une prime quand ils voient à ce que leurs patients puissent recevoir leurs soins en temps opportun. À l’heure actuelle, les médecins de famille sont payés selon un modèle de rémunération à l’acte ou ils sont embauchés à contrat.

Dans le cadre du nouveau modèle, les médecins dans une clinique travaillent ensemble pour assurer les soins aux patients de la clinique, de sorte que lorsqu’un médecin s’absente ou qu’il n’est pas disponible, un autre médecin peut assurer les soins nécessaires. Cela signifie que plus de rendez-vous pourraient être offerts le même jour ou le lendemain, en soirée ou les fins de semaine, ce qui offrirait aux patients un meilleur accès aux soins. 

Les médecins de famille participants continueront d’être payés selon le modèle de rémunération existant, mais à la fin de la période d’essai, ils recevront un supplément s’ils ont gagné plus en fonction du nouveau modèle.
  
Le projet pilote devrait durer au moins jusqu’à mars 2023.

"Health and Wellness","New Family Doctor Funding Model Pilot Project","HEALTH/WELLNESS--New Family Doctor Funding Model Pilot Project
----------------------------------------------------------
A new funding model for family doctors is designed to encourage more team-based care and to make it easier for patients to get the care they need, when and where they need it.

Doctors Nova Scotia and the government worked together to develop the new model, which will be piloted at several family practices.

“Competitive compensation is critical to recruiting and keeping doctors who will care for Nova Scotians,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “This funding model aims to better support family physicians and improve patients’ access to care. We’re pleased to collaborate with Doctors Nova Scotia and we’re looking forward to seeing how this model can help us reach those goals.”

The payment model, which is called blended capitation, will compensate family doctors based on how many patients they have and the number of services they provide. Physicians may also receive a bonus for ensuring their patients can receive timely access to care. Currently, family doctors are paid using a fee-for-service model or by contract.

Under the new model, physicians in a clinic work together to care for the practice’s patients, so if a physician is away or unavailable, another can provide care. This means more appointments could be available the same or next day, in the evenings and on weekends, improving access for patients.

Participating family doctors will continue to be paid using their existing payment model, but at the end of the pilot period, they will receive a top-up if they earned more under the new model. 

The pilot project is expected to run until at least March 2023.

Quotes:
“With an aging, sicker population, patient care today is much more complex and billing codes haven’t evolved to accurately reflect the work physicians do. This pilot project will test and inform a new payment model, which intends to make it easier for family doctors to provide the care their patients need.”
     - Dr. Leisha Hawker, President, Doctors Nova Scotia

“My colleagues and I are excited to be engaged in this pilot program, and we look forward to seeing how this new model can further enhance patient access to our team of healthcare providers.”
     - Dr. Holly Zwicker, family physician, Upper Tantallon

Quick Facts:
-- the new funding model will be piloted immediately at practices in Cheticamp, New Minas and Upper Tantallon; several other practices may be added to the pilot in the coming weeks
-- the 2019 Master Agreement between the Province and Doctors Nova Scotia provides $7.3 million to pay doctors in the blended capitation pilot program
-- Doctors Nova Scotia is the professional association that represents physicians in the province

"Economic Development","Province Invests in Verschuren Centre Expansion","ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT--Province Invests in Verschuren Centre Expansion 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing in Nova Scotia’s clean technology sector by supporting the Verschuren Centre for Sustainability in Energy and the Environment in Sydney to expand into a national biomanufacturing centre.

A $2.5-million investment in the centre, which helps clean-tech companies develop and commercialize innovative and sustainable technologies, was announced today, June 9, by Economic Development Minister Susan Corkum-Greek.

“As Nova Scotia grows its economy into one that is greener and more sustainable, an expanded Verschuren Centre will play an invaluable role in our success,” said Minister Corkum-Greek. “We are thrilled to support this expansion, as biomanufacturing will allow the centre to hire more skilled workers and help companies accelerate and scale up their product development in ways that are not available anywhere else in Canada.”

Biomanufacturing is the process of using living systems, including plant and animal cells, to produce commercial materials. The Verschuren Centre is already home to a bioreactor – one of only three in Canada – but its expansion into a national bioprocessing centre will increase its bioreactor capacity by more than 10 times. 

The new facility will be a first of its kind in Canada and result in an initial 40 jobs with an aim to attract 10 new companies per year.

The Government of Canada, through the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), is also contributing $2 million toward the expansion through the Canada Coal Transition Initiative Infrastructure Fund. An additional $2.3 million is coming from Next Generation Manufacturing Canada, $1.3 million from the Verschuren Centre and $500,000 from DeNova, a clean technology company in Halifax.

The Verschuren Centre’s expansion will play an important role in helping the Minister of Economic Development fulfill her mandate of attracting and growing innovative, sustainable and green businesses across the province and supporting businesses in reducing emissions.

Quotes:
“The Verschuren Centre continues to attract innovative companies and skilled workers to bring disruptive clean technologies to market faster. The centre is a true leader in promoting sustainablity in the Canadian manufacturing sector and is helping put Cape Breton – and Canada – at the forefront of the new bio-economy. We are proud to be supporting this expansion.” 
     - Ginette Petitpas Taylor, Minister responsible for ACOA

“Biomanufacturing has been cited as the internet of the future in relation to speed of development and impact on sustainable procurement, and as such companies in this field need to scale rapidly in a capital intensive and unencumbered environment. The Verschuren Centre’s new business model was created to provide just that, development speed, capital efficiency and open access technical capacity not readily available elsewhere.”
     - Beth Mason, President, Verschuren Centre for Sustainability in Energy and the Environment

“NGen’s investment in the Verschuren Centre’s bioprocessing facility will pave the way for biotechnology and clean-tech entrepreneurs to work together with industry to develop transformative solutions for environmental sustainability. We are pleased to join with our colleagues at ACOA and the Province of Nova Scotia in supporting the scale-up of the Centre’s bioreactor capacity, which promises not only to attract top-notch talent and investment to Cape Breton and Atlantic Canada, but which will also enhance Canada’s position as a world leader in advanced manufacturing.”
     - Jayson Myers, CEO, Next Generation Manufacturing Canada

Quick Facts:
-- the expansion will help the Verschuren Centre attract top talent from across Canada and internationally to help find solutions for the world’s biggest environmental challenges
-- the Verschuren Centre and the companies it works with are helping to diversify Nova Scotia’s economy by creating new opportunities in the clean-tech sector
-- the Province’s investment is from the 2021-22 budget

----------------------------------------------------------------
Young skilled trades workers in Nova Scotia will be the first to benefit from the More Opportunity for Skilled Trades (MOST) program, aimed at attracting and retaining young people in key sectors and shaping the workforce of tomorrow.

For those tradespeople under the age of 30 who are employed and registered as apprentices or certified as journeypersons in eligible skilled trades and occupations, MOST will return their provincial income tax paid on the first $50,000 of income earned.

Premier Tim Houston announced more details about the program today, June 8, at the Irving Shipyard in Halifax.

“We want young skilled workers to know they have a bright future in Nova Scotia, where they can work, build their lives and contribute to the incredible growth our province is experiencing,” said Premier Houston. “Nova Scotia isn’t alone in facing gaps in our labour market, but what sets us apart is the concrete actions we are taking to address the problem. This is an upfront investment in young people that will lead to long-term economic growth.”

The first eligible trades under the program are in the construction, industrial/manufacturing, motive power and service sectors. A full list of the eligible skilled trades is available here: https://novascotia.ca/budget/docs/Tax-measures-More-Opportunity-for-Skilled-Trades.pdf

The MOST program will be in effect for the 2022 income tax year. Eligible workers will qualify for their refund next year, after they file their 2022 income tax return and receive a notice of assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency. More information about the refund process will be available in the coming months.

“Nova Scotia has a lot to offer and we are working with employers to find new ways to retain the workers we have and attract new people in these important careers to the province. That is why I am excited to see the official launch of MOST,” said Labour, Skills and Immigration Minister Jill Balser. “Skilled trades are vital to our overall economic growth and offer a rewarding and viable career path.” 

As needs in other sectors are identified, MOST will expand to include additional occupations.

------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is making regulatory changes to help ensure the air Nova Scotians breathe is clean and healthy and that industrial noise does not impact people’s well-being. 

Consultation on provincial Air Quality Regulations begins today, June 8, Clean Air Day. The focus is on the standards that are used to ensure industrial emissions have minimal impact on air quality.

“Our industries provide valuable jobs and economic opportunities throughout our province – we want to work with them to update these regulations to ensure ongoing sustainable development that protects our environment while helping both our economy and our people to thrive,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Updated, clear, modern environmental standards that are based on the latest science will help ensure Nova Scotia is a clean, healthy place to live, work and do business.”

The Department will have targeted consultation with the following stakeholders:
-- industries and businesses that produce air emissions
-- businesses that have an industrial approval to operate in Nova Scotia
-- industry professional associations and consultants
-- the Nova Scotia College of Respiratory Therapists
-- lung healthcare specialists
-- the Lung Association of Nova Scotia
-- Cystic Fibrosis Canada – Atlantic Office
-- environmental stewardship organizations
-- municipalities
-- the Halifax Chamber of Commerce
-- the Mi’kmaq of Nova Scotia.

Other interested Nova Scotians can offer input by sending an email to air@novascotia.ca or filling in the general feedback form at: https://novascotia.ca/ambient-air-quality-standards-public-engagement/ 

The regulatory update will also take into account new World Health Organization Global Air Quality Guidelines and the most current science.

Nova Scotia’s Guidelines for Noise Measurement and Assessment will also be updated to better protect Nova Scotians from industrial noise. These guidelines were last updated in 1990. The Department will look at new science for how industrial noise is assessed and how it impacts well-being. Targeted stakeholder engagement will begin later this year.

"Health and Wellness / Advanced Education","Easier Path for LPNs to become Registered Nurses","HEALTH/WELLNESS/ADVANCED EDUCATION--Easier Path for LPNs to become Registered Nurses 
----------------------------------------------------------------
More licensed practical nurses (LPNs) can now further their education to become registered nurses (RNs) more quickly in Nova Scotia.

Eligibility criteria is being expanded to allow more LPNs to qualify for bachelor of science, nursing (BScN) programs at Cape Breton University (CBU) and St. Francis Xavier University. The programs allow LPNs who meet academic, work experience and other licensing requirements to use their existing education and experience to more quickly complete the BScN program and become RNs.

“Nurses are needed in so many communities across the province,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “Interest in nursing as a profession – and these programs at CBU and St. FX in particular – has seen a real increase over the last few years and we’re excited more people will be able to take advantage of them.”

Eligibility is being expanded to include LPN graduates from out-of-province programs, as well as graduates from Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) from before 2008. Previously, only NSCC graduates from 2008 or later were eligible.

Changes take effect for students beginning their studies in the 2022-23 academic year. It is estimated that about 4,400 Nova Scotia LPNs could now be eligible.

Quotes:
“This collaboration between the government, the Nova Scotia College of Nursing and our post-secondary institutions exhibits the innovative thinking from all players to transform our healthcare system in Nova Scotia. We’re all working together to line up the next generation of nurses in Nova Scotia.”
     - Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education

“This is wonderful news for all practicing LPNs, as it will provide everyone the same advantage to continue their education, if they choose. I was very lucky to be able to apply and further my education and not worry about other restrictions.”
     - Marcie MacPhee, Cape Breton University nursing student who has been an LPN for three years

“Every nurse is vital to our health system regardless of their designation; however, expanding eligibility criteria for education to make it easier for LPNs wanting to become RNs will benefit everyone – the LPNs, the nursing profession, the health system and all Nova Scotians.”
     - Sue Smith, CEO and Registrar, Nova Scotia College of Nursing

Quick Facts:
-- 74 people have completed the LPN to BScN programs since they were launched in 2016
-- the Province, the Nova Scotia College of Nursing, CBU and St. FX have agreed on the expanded eligibility for the LPN to BScN programs at both universities
-- LPNs care for patients who are considered stable with predictable outcomes in a variety of settings, providing nursing services in collaboration with an RN, physician or other authorized healthcare professional
-- about 450 RNs and 250 LPNs graduate every year from Nova Scotia schools
-- the government announced in 2021 that all nurses graduating from Nova Scotia’s universities and NSCC for the next five years will be offered a job in the province

Community groups can move forward with projects that promote healthier communities, improve infrastructure and foster economic growth with the help of a $1.7-million investment from the Province.

The government is funding 47 projects through the Recreational Facility Development Grant program. These funds help community groups, municipalities and other not-for-profit organizations develop and improve facilities to increase public participation in sport and physical recreation.

“Projects like these keep our communities strong and healthy,” said Keith Bain, MLA for Victoria-The Lakes, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “These recreation facilities contribute significantly to our communities and enable Nova Scotians to access services and lead healthy, active lifestyles.”

For example, North Highlands Nordic received a $62,000 investment to complete the final phase of upgrades to the ski club. This includes constructing a barrier-free indoor recreation facility, allowing the club to expand its equipment loan programs, training opportunities, recreational skiing, equipment storage and event hosting. 

Quotes:
“North Highlands Nordic Cape North is pleased to receive funding from Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage to help bring the Nordic Centre closer to completion. An already popular winter tourism destination area will be enhanced with a cafe and large social gathering space.”
     - Linda Murray, Past President, North Highlands Nordic 

Quick Facts:
-- the total amount of funding for the 47 projects is $1,729,083
-- applications for next year’s grants will open in late fall 
-- recreation centres and halls, pools, arenas, athletic fields, playgrounds, parks, trails and other facilities that promote sport and physical recreation are eligible for funding under the program

"Health and Wellness","Nova Scotians Warned About Potential Toxins in Certain Mussels, Clams","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Nova Scotians Warned About Potential Toxins in Certain Mussels, Clams
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mussels or clams sold on Thursday, June 2, at a fish shop in Lunenburg may be unsafe.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency tested blue mussels at the Corkums Island mussel farm on May 30, 2022 and discovered the presence of toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning. The harvesting area has been closed.

Mussels and clams harvested on that day were sold to two customers on June 2 at the Corkums Island Mussel Farm and Fish Shop in Lunenburg. 

If eaten, shellfish with toxins causing paralytic shellfish poisoning can cause a number of symptoms, including:

-- tingling 
-- numbness spreading from the lips and mouth to the face, neck and extremities
-- dizziness
-- arm and leg weakness or paralysis
-- headaches and nausea
-- respiratory failure
-- death, in severe cases

Cooking or freezing will not remove the toxin, so anyone who bought these mussels or clams should discard them. Symptoms start quickly, between 30 minutes to three hours. There have been no reported illnesses to date.

Anyone who ate clams or mussels sold at the Corkums Island Mussel Farm and Fish Shop in Lunenburg on June 2, and has any of these symptoms, should seek medical attention.

The presence of these toxins in shellfish result from conditions in the marine environment, and not from any deficiencies in harvesting or processing.

Three new judges have been appointed to the provincial court effective today, June 3.
Attorney General and Minister of Justice Brad Johns named lawyers Kelly Serbu, QC, of Halifax, Nicole Ann Rovers of Antigonish, and Bradley Gordon Sarson of Bedford to the bench.

“Nova Scotians are fortunate to have these accomplished professionals joining the provincial court,” said Minister Johns. “They are experienced and respected lawyers and active members of their communities. They have all demonstrated professional integrity, good character and outstanding contributions to the practice of law.”

Mr. Serbu was a criminal defence lawyer in private practice. He is Metis and has practised law for more than 24 years.

The Province has appointed retired senior Crown attorney John Scott as interim Director of the Province’s Serious Incident Response Team (SiRT). Work is underway to hire a permanent director.

Mr. Scott’s appointment is effective Monday, June 6. He also served as interim Director in 2017-18.

“Mr. Scott is a highly respected former senior Crown attorney who brings skill, expertise and past experience to this position,” said Attorney General and Justice Minister Brad Johns. “I thank Mr. Scott for agreeing to take on the role during this time of transition. Nova Scotians can continue to have confidence in the system of police oversight in this province.”

Mr. Scott, a graduate of St. Mary’s University and Dalhousie Law School, joined the bar in 1976 and worked as a Crown attorney for 38 years until his retirement in 2014. He has experience at all levels of court in Nova Scotia, handling a wide range of cases.

SiRT provides civilian-led oversight of policing by investigating serious incidents involving police, independent of both government and police. The agency investigates all matters that involve death, serious injury, sexual assault and domestic violence, or other matters of significant public interest that may have arisen from the actions of any police agency across the province.

Mr. Scott will oversee a team of four investigators and an administrative support person.

Quotes:
“I look forward to working with SiRT and continuing the important role this service provides to the police and public. I plan to draw on my many years of experience as a Crown attorney and my previous experience in the interim Director’s role in carrying out the duties and functions this position demands.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A full list of advisory committee members follows the release.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Two advisory committees, with refreshed terms of reference and membership, will help the Province implement ecological forestry and achieve healthier forests.

Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton announced appointments to the Forest Biodiversity Science Advisory Committee and the Ministerial Advisory Committee today, June 3.

“We’re entering a new phase in ecological forestry implementation and it’s important to me that our work continues to be guided by expert voices and the best available science,” said Minister Rushton. “I thank committee members for sharing their time and expertise on behalf of all Nova Scotians. As we move forward with this critical work, we will benefit from these additional perspectives, as well as ongoing input from key stakeholders and the public.”

Appointments include people from environmental organizations, the forestry industry, the Mi'kmaw community and academia.

Six members have been appointed to the Forest Biodiversity Science Advisory Committee, which guides the Department’s forest science and research. Members were chosen for their field expertise and their advice will address complex biodiversity conservation and resource-use issues. The committee will be providing scientific reviews needed to carry out several recommendations from the Forest Practices Review.

The Ministerial Advisory Committee, established in 2019, completed its mandate last fall. Six new members and one returning member have been appointed to advise the Minister on the adoption of ecological forestry on Crown land. This includes a new independent chair. Members were chosen for their expertise or experience in biodiversity and forestry.

Revised terms of reference will be posted online once approved by the committees.

Quotes:
“Our committee will guide necessary scientific research and connect with the broader scientific community to support ecological forestry. The committee will also be focused on specific recommendations from the Forest Practices Review related to healthy forests and biodiversity, as we move to an ecosystem approach to forestry and sustainable forest resource use.”
     - Tara Crewe, Chair, Forest Biodiversity Science Advisory Committee; Manager of Ecosystems and Habitats, Department of Natural Resources and Renewables 

“I look forward to working with these members whose diverse interests, expertise, and perspectives will support government’s ongoing work in achieving ecological forestry on Crown lands.”
     - Greg Herrett, Chair, Ministerial Advisory Committee; Chief Administrative Officer, Municipality of the County of Cumberland

Quick Facts:
-- Forest Biodiversity Science Advisory Committee appointments are for three years
-- Ministerial Advisory Committee appointments are for two years
-- the Terms of Reference for the Forestry Transition Team, appointed in 2020, expired in June 2021; the appointed government and industry representatives of this team made numerous recommendations to the government on short-term actions that helped affected workers and businesses after the closure of the Northern Pulp mill and on areas for investment and action to support an ecologically sustainable and competitive forestry sector over the longer-term

"Premier's Office / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Nova Scotia to Welcome Charter Flight of Ukrainian Nationals","PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Nova Scotia to Welcome Charter Flight of Ukrainian Nationals
---------------------------------------------------------------
A chartered flight carrying more than 300 Ukrainian nationals will land at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport from Warsaw, Poland, later today, June 2. While many are expected to stay in Nova Scotia, others will resettle in other parts of Atlantic Canada. 

Premier Tim Houston, with Labour, Skills and Immigration Minister Jill Balser, will be at the airport to welcome Ukrainians. 

“Ukrainians fleeing their country have sacrificed so much in pursuit of their families’ safety,” said Premier Houston. “Nova Scotians are welcoming and have a history of helping those in crisis. We want Ukrainians to know that we are here to support them, and that they have a place in our workplaces, schools and communities.”

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is leading the effort to get Ukrainians to Canada under the new Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET). IRCC arranged for the charter flight and income support for basic needs for a limited period of time. While the CUAET is not a refugee stream, all Ukrainian temporary residents and their dependents will be eligible for settlement services, can opt in to open work permits and can apply for permanent residency.

Nova Scotia is working to assess the needs of those who choose to stay in the province, including creating a homestay program in partnership with the Nova Scotia branch of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. Its aim is to help match people with housing needs to host families after the 14 days of accommodation provided by the federal government. 

“Now is Nova Scotia’s time to help, and we’re so proud to welcome Ukrainians to Nova Scotia as a safe haven, whether they decide to stay for a short or long time,” said Minister Balser. “We all have a role to play in helping newcomers who want to start a new life in Nova Scotia, knowing that we all benefit when they are successful here. I encourage Nova Scotians who want to help to find out how they can do so in their community.” 

The Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration has partnered with the YMCA, Immigration Services Association of Nova Scotia and the Nova Scotia branch of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress to ensure Ukrainian newcomers have access to settlement services, including needs assessment and referral, language assessment and training, information sessions about life in Canada, guidance on job opportunities, housing, daycare subsidy and public school enrolment.

The Province will continue to assess and adjust services in response to the evolving humanitarian crisis.

Quotes: 
“Since the full-scale invasion started on February 24, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress has advocated for support of displaced Ukrainians with all levels of government in Canada. The Government of Nova Scotia has stood in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, a firm stance that our organization is grateful for.  We are pleased to collaborate with the provincial government, YMCA and ISANS in ensuring proper housing and job-search supports are put in place to facilitate transitions for war-affected Ukrainians arriving in Nova Scotia by charter today. Nova Scotians have shown their generosity and kindness; many have opened their homes, donated items and are now waiting to accept displaced Ukrainians with open arms into their communities. On behalf of our Ukrainian-Canadian community, I am thankful for your solace and hospitality.”
     - Lyubov Zhyznomirska, Vice-President, Nova Scotia branch of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress

Quick Facts: 
-- Nova Scotia has a Ukrainian community of more than 9,000 people
-- in March, the Province donated $100,000 to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation to provide humanitarian support such as food, medical aid and emergency shelter
-- more than 300 Ukrainians have already arrived in Nova Scotia since resettlement efforts began
-- as of May 20, IRCC has received 241,620 applications for the CUAET, with over 112,035 applications approved

-------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 1,563 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 41 hospitalizations and nine deaths during the seven-day period ending May 30. The number of new PCR-positive tests and hospitalizations is similar to last week.

“We have learned so much about COVID-19 – how the virus is spread, who is at highest risk of severe outcomes, and the personal actions we can take to protect ourselves, our loved ones and each other,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Virus activity has slowed over the last several weeks, but it hasn’t stopped. COVID-19 is here to stay, so we need to continue to keep each other safe.”

People 70 years of age and older continue to be at highest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. Since the start of the Omicron waves December 8, 2021, the median age of hospitalizations is 71, and the median age of people who have died is 81. All of the COVID-19 deaths reported this week were people 70 years of age or older.

The data show that the risk of hospitalization is nearly 11 times higher for people 70 and older and the risk of death about 115 times higher when compared to those under 50. Vaccine-related immunity wanes much more quickly in people 70 and older, which is why a second booster dose was recommended this spring. Most adults under 70 are still well protected by their two-dose primary series plus one booster.

To date, 65.7 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose, and 64,934 people have received a second.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The full report is available here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

« Nous avons appris beaucoup de choses au sujet de la COVID-19, notamment la façon dont elle se transmet, les personnes les plus à risque de complications graves et les gestes que nous pouvons poser pour nous protéger les uns les autres, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. L'activité virale a ralenti au cours des dernières semaines, mais elle est toujours présente. La COVID-19 sera ici pendant un bon bout de temps, et il faut continuer de se protéger les uns les autres. »

Les personnes de 70 ans ou plus sont toujours les plus à risque de complications graves en raison de la COVID-19. Depuis le début des vagues Omicron le 8 décembre 2021, l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées et décédées est de 71 et 81 ans respectivement. Tous les décès causés par la COVID-19 signalés cette semaine sont des personnes de 70 ans ou plus.

Les données indiquent que le risque d'hospitalisation est près de 11 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est d'environ 115 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. L'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel est recommandée pour ces personnes. La plupart des gens de moins de 70 ans sont bien protégés par une série primaire de deux doses plus une dose de rappel.

Jusqu'à présent, 65,7 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel, et 64 934 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel.

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Santé publique pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés.

------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : La liste des 70 premiers récipiendaires de la médaille figure à la fin du communiqué.
------------------------------------------------------
Le lieutenant-gouverneur Arthur J. LeBlanc a annoncé aujourd’hui 2 juin que la reine avait approuvé le motif de la médaille du jubilé de platine. Au cours des prochains mois, elle sera décernée à 5 000 personnes de la Nouvelle-Écosse en reconnaissance de leurs contributions importantes et de leur service à la province.

Les noms des 70 premiers récipiendaires ont été annoncés en guise de lancement du programme de la médaille, qui souligne le 70e anniversaire de l’accession au trône de la Reine. Les récipiendaires représentent un large éventail des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui ont contribué à divers domaines et à une variété d’organismes.

« Puisque le règne de Sa Majesté incarne l’importance de l’engagement d’une personne envers sa collectivité, le jubilé de platine fournit aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse des occasions de rendre hommage aux personnes dans notre province qui ont fait preuve d’un dévouement inébranlable envers leur famille, leurs voisins et leurs collègues », a déclaré le lieutenant-gouverneur LeBlanc. 

D’un côté, la médaille montre une effigie couronnée de la Reine avec son titre et le mot Canada. De l’autre, on y voit, dans la moitié supérieure, les armoiries de la Nouvelle-Écosse, le monogramme royal et les années de son règne. Une paire de fleurs de mai – l’emblème floral de la province – et l’expression latine « VIVAT REGINA » qui signifie « Vive la reine » apparaissent dans la moitié inférieure. 

« La médaille du jubilé de platine est une distinction importante décernée à des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et du Canada qui contribuent au mieux-être de leurs collectivités, a indiqué le premier ministre Tim Houston. Je suis heureux de voir que 5 000 personnes méritantes de la Nouvelle-Écosse recevront ainsi la reconnaissance qu’elles méritent. »

"Lieutenant-Governor","Platinum Jubilee Medal Design Unveiled, First 70 Recipients Announced","LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR--Platinum Jubilee Medal Design Unveiled, First 70 Recipients Announced
-------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The list of the first 70 medal recipients follows this release.
--------------------------------------------------------
Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc announced today, June 2, that the Queen has approved the design of the Platinum Jubilee Medal. Over the coming months, it will be awarded to 5,000 Nova Scotians in recognition of significant contributions and service to the province.

To launch the medal program, which marks the 70th anniversary of the Queen’s accession to the throne, the names of the first 70 recipients have been released. They represent a broad cross-section of Nova Scotians who have contributed to diverse fields and organizations.

“As Her Majesty’s reign embodies the importance of commitment to one’s community, the Platinum Jubilee provides opportunities for Nova Scotians to honour those in our province who have demonstrated an unwavering dedication to family, neighbours and colleagues,” said Lt-Gov. LeBlanc.

The medal displays a crowned effigy of the Queen with her Canadian style and title on the front. The back features the shield of arms of Nova Scotia with the Queen’s Royal Cypher and dates of her reign. A pair of mayflowers – the provincial flower – and the Latin phrase “VIVAT REGINA” which means “LONG LIVE THE QUEEN” appear at the base.

“The Platinum Jubilee Medal is a significant honour afforded to Nova Scotians and Canadians making a difference in their communities,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I am pleased that 5,000 deserving Nova Scotians will receive recognition through this award.”

The Government of Nova Scotia established the Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee Medal program in March.

Quick Facts:
-- the Platinum Jubilee is being celebrated throughout the Commonwealth
-- during her reign, the Queen has visited Nova Scotia on five royal tours, the first in 1951
-- at Government House in Halifax in 1959, the Queen announced the appointment of the first French Canadian Governor General, Georges Vanier
-- the inaugural Platinum Jubilee Medal presentation ceremony will be held in July 2022
-- the medal program is modelled on the highly successful Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee Medal, which saw 3,800 Nova Scotians recognized in 2012

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Plus de familles auront accès aux services agréés de garde d'enfants","ÉDUCATION ET DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA PETITE ENFANCE--Plus de familles auront accès aux services agréés de garde d'enfants 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Les services agréés de garde d'enfants en Nouvelle-Écosse seront bientôt plus faciles d'accès et plus abordables.

Aujourd'hui 1er juin, les gouvernements du Canada et de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont annoncé que 1 500 nouvelles places seront créées dans les établissements agréés d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants à l'échelle de la province d'ici au 31 décembre 2022. Les familles qui utiliseront ces nouvelles places recevront la même réduction de 25 % des frais que les familles qui utilisent les services existants, ainsi que la réduction de 50 % qui sera en vigueur à la fin de l'année 2022.

« Il s'agit d'un moment historique pour les collectivités de la province, y compris celles où des services agréés de garde d'enfants n'étaient pas offerts auparavant, comme à Ingonish, affirme Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Une augmentation du nombre de places dans les services agréés de garde d'enfants signifie qu'il y aura un plus grand nombre d'options abordables et de qualité supérieure et permettra d'offrir une tranquillité d'esprit aux familles. » 

Les nouvelles places sont financées par la somme de 29 millions de dollars investie cette année dans l'expansion des services de garde d'enfants dans le cadre de l'Accord entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada. Ces places seront ajoutées dans 45 centres à but non lucratif et sept agences de services agréés de garderie en milieu familial.

Les nouvelles places seront ajoutées aux endroits suivants : 
-- East Preston Day Care Centre à East Preston ajoutera huit nouvelles places pour les nourrissons au centre actuel, et 60 nouvelles places pour les nourrissons et les tout-petits au nouveau centre familial Akoma.
-- Taigh Curaim Day Care Society à Baddeck ouvrira un nouveau centre à Ingonish et créera 24 nouvelles places pour les nourrissons, les tout-petits et les enfants de 3 ans. Il s'agit du premier service agréé de garde d'enfants offert dans la collectivité d'Ingonish.
-- Little People's Place à Shelburne créera 32 nouvelles places pour les nourrissons, les tout-petits et les enfants d'âge préscolaire (avant et après l'école).
-- Cape Breton Family Place, une agence agréée de services de garderie en milieu familial, ajoutera 12 nouveaux fournisseurs de services de garderie en milieu familial  dans les comtés de Richmond, de Victoria et d'Inverness, et dans la Municipalité régionale du Cap-Breton.

De plus, les efforts se poursuivent en ce qui a trait à la stratégie de la Nouvelle-Écosse « Excellence dans l'éducation de la petite enfance », qui entraînera une augmentation des salaires et des avantages sociaux pour les éducatrices de la petite enfance dès l'automne. 

Le gouvernement du Canada a fait un investissement transformateur visant à bâtir un système d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada en collaboration avec ses partenaires provinciaux, territoriaux et autochtones. Pour appuyer l'objectif visant à offrir aux familles l'accès à des services d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants abordables, flexibles, inclusifs et de qualité supérieure, le gouvernement du Canada offre une somme de 605 millions de dollars pour la Nouvelle-Écosse de 2021-2022 à 2025-2026, en plus d'un financement de 58 millions de dollars sur quatre ans pour l'entente de prorogation entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur les services d'apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants et d'un investissement ponctuel d'environ 10,9 millions de dollars en 2021-2022 à l'appui de la main-d'oeuvre du secteur de la petite enfance de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

     - Rajean Willis, parent de deux jeunes enfants, East Preston

Faits en bref
-- Parmi les 1 500 nouvelles places, 1 250 seront créées dans des centres à but non lucratif, et les autres places seront créées par des fournisseurs de services agréés de garde d'enfants en milieu familial par l'entremise de sept agences de services agréés de garderie en milieu familial.
-- Une déclaration d'intérêt a été publiée en octobre à l'intention des fournisseurs à but non lucratif qui souhaitaient offrir des places supplémentaires. Les projets ont été évalués selon le besoin communautaire, la croissance de la population, la capacité organisationnelle et l'utilisation de l'infrastructure et des partenaires existants.
-- En vertu de l'Accord entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada, les frais de service agréés de garde d'enfants ont été réduits de 25 %, en moyenne. Cette réduction était rétroactive au 1er janvier 2022. 
-- La réduction de 25 % est la première étape dans la réduction des frais de garde d'enfants de 50 %, en moyenne, d'ici la fin de l'année 2022, et un pas vers l'atteinte de l'objectif d'offrir des frais moyens de 10 $ par jour d'ici au 31 mars 2026.

"Education and Early Childhood Development","More Families to Have Access to Licensed Child Care","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--More Families to Have Access to Licensed Child Care 
----------------------------------------------------------------
It will soon be easier and more affordable for families to access licensed child care in Nova Scotia.

Today, June 1, the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia announced that 1,500 new licensed early learning and child-care spaces will be created across the province by December 31, 2022. Families using these new spaces will receive the same 25 per cent fee reduction as those using existing licensed child care and the 50 per cent reduction that will take effect by the end of 2022.

“This is historic for communities across the province, including those where licensed child care has previously been unavailable, such as in Ingonish,” said Becky Druhan, Nova Scotia’s Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “An increase in licensed child-care spaces means more child-care options that are high-quality, affordable and offer families peace of mind.” 

The new spaces are funded through the $29 million invested this year in child-care space expansion under the Canada-Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement. They are being created at 45 not-for-profit centres and seven family home child-care agencies.

The new spaces include: 
-- the East Preston Day Care Centre in East Preston will add eight new infant spaces at its existing site and 60 new infant and toddler spaces at its new location at the Akoma Family Centre in Dartmouth
-- the Taigh Curaim Day Care Society in Baddeck will expand to Ingonish and create 24 new spaces for infants, toddlers and three-year-olds; this is the first time Ingonish residents will have access to licensed child care in the community
-- Little People’s Place in Shelburne will create 32 new spaces, including infant, toddler and preschool care
-- the Cape Breton Family Place, a licensed family home child care agency, will add 12 new home child-care providers in the counties of Richmond, Victoria and Inverness and in Cape Breton Regional Municipality.

Work also continues on Nova Scotia’s Excellence in Early Childhood Education Workforce Strategy, which will result in a compensation package for early childhood educators this fall.

The Government of Canada made a transformative investment to build a Canada-wide early learning and child-care system in partnership with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners. To support the goal of ensuring families’ access to high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning and child care, the Government of Canada is contributing $605 million for Nova Scotia from 2021-22 to 2025-26, in addition to $58 million over the same four years for the Canada-Nova Scotia Early Learning and Child Care Extension Agreement, and a one-time investment of about $10.9 million in 2021-22 to support Nova Scotia’s early childhood workforce.

Quotes:
“Every child deserves the best start in life. These additional licensed child-care spaces will allow more Nova Scotia children and families across the province to access high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning and child care.”
     - Karina Gould, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development

“The many trailblazers in early child education before us have demonstrated the need for quality child care and education in our society. I want to recognize their dedication to the field and their hard work. By ensuring more families have access to affordable, quality child care in their community, we are setting our province up for future success and growth.” 
     - Trina Fraser, Executive Director, East Preston Day Care Centre 

“I am so happy to hear about the new child-care spaces being available in East Preston. I love that my children and others alike can be cared for in one of our home communities. The legacy of East Preston Day Care is one to celebrate and an expansion can only build upon this legacy!”
     - Rajean Willis, parent of two young children, East Preston

Quick Facts:
-- the breakdown of the 1,500 spaces includes 1,250 through not-for-profit centres, with the remaining spaces with new home-care providers through seven licensed family home child care agencies
-- an expression of intent was issued in October to not-for-profit providers looking to expand; projects were evaluated based on community need, population growth, organizational capacity and the use of existing infrastructure and partnerships
-- through the Canada-Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, fees for licensed child-care spaces were reduced by 25 per cent, on average, retroactive to January 1, 2022 
-- the 25 per cent reduction is an initial step in reducing child care fees for Nova Scotian families by 50 per cent, on average, by the end of 2022, and in achieving an average of $10 per day child care by March 31, 2026

"Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Film Fund Cap Raised, Fund Increased for 2022-23","COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE--Film Fund Cap Raised, Fund Increased for 2022-23
--------------------------------------------------------
The Province is increasing the project cap under the Nova Scotia Film and Television Production Incentive Fund, making it easier for larger productions to film in Nova Scotia.

Effective immediately, the maximum amount of funding a project can receive is $10 million, up from $4 million. Nova Scotia is also investing an extra $16.4 million in the film fund above the annual budget of $25 million, bringing the fund’s total to $41.4 million for 2022-23.

“Nova Scotia’s film industry is thriving as more productions – and bigger productions – look to our beautiful province as the ideal place to work,” said Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “Along with the investments we’ve made to support homegrown talent and infrastructure in the industry, this increase and update to the film fund will allow the industry to continue to grow and benefit our economy.”

To date, 75 film fund applications have been approved for 2022-23. Applicants can apply for a grant of between 25 to 32 per cent of their eligible Nova Scotia costs.

Quotes:
“Today’s announcement is only further evidence of Premier Houston’s commitment to the growth of the film industry. The per project cap has been one of our industry's largest barriers to entry. Raising it to $10 million means that Nova Scotia is positioned to welcome significantly larger projects, create many more jobs and generate an enormous economic return for the province.”
     - Laura Mackenzie, Executive Director, Screen Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- the film industry contributed about $180.8 million to Nova Scotia’s economy in 2021-22, up from about $78 million in 2019-20 and $91.6 million in 2020-21
-- the Province supported 82 projects through the Film and Television Production Incentive Fund in 2021-22
-- in March, Nova Scotia invested $8 million toward a new soundstage to increase the film industry’s capacity and $15 million for a new Nova Scotia Content Creator Fund that will benefit local film and television productions

"Premier's Office","Dr. Robert Strang Mayflower Award for Healthcare Professionals","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Dr. Robert Strang Mayflower Award for Healthcare Professionals
--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Robert Strang, is being recognized for his leadership and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new award named in his honour. 

The Dr. Robert Strang Mayflower Award for Healthcare Professionals will recognize those who, like its namesake, demonstrate outstanding strength, perseverance and courage in delivering frontline healthcare in challenging circumstances.

Dr. Strang is the first recipient of the award, which references Nova Scotia’s official flower. The mayflower also blooms in adverse conditions.

“We all looked to Dr. Strang for guidance and leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic – and he always showed up for us, even on the most challenging days,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Dr. Strang’s unwavering commitment to protecting the public’s health made Nova Scotia among the safest places to live during the pandemic. But he was always the first to say he is simply the voice of an entire team. With this new award, we’re able to continue to recognize that same dedication seen every day on the frontlines of healthcare.”

Beginning in 2023, the Dr. Robert Strang Mayflower Award for Healthcare Professionals will be awarded annually in May to as many as five people. All frontline healthcare workers are eligible, including nurses, doctors, paramedics, continuing care assistants, and pharmacists. They can be full- or part-time, casual, temporary or permanent, new to the field or with many years of experience.

Each of the mayflower’s five petals on the award represents the values Dr. Strang demonstrated each day during the pandemic: commitment to protecting public health; courage of conviction needed to make difficult but necessary decisions; and the ‘three Cs’ he spoke of so often – caring, compassion, and community.

More information will be available later this year when nominations open for the 2023 award. 

Quotes:
“I am truly humbled to receive this award today. I accept it on behalf of the many skilled and dedicated professionals who worked just as hard, faced just as many challenges, and showed up each day to protect the health of all Nova Scotians. It has not always been easy, but it has been a pleasure and a privilege – and it’s one I will never forget.”
     - Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health

“Through the last two years, Nova Scotians have experienced first-hand the caring, compassion and sense of community Dr. Strang has demonstrated throughout his career in the public service. The Dr. Robert Strang Mayflower Award for Healthcare Professionals allows us to recognize his outstanding work throughout the pandemic and celebrate his legacy for years to come.”
     - Laura Lee Langley, Deputy Minister and Head of the Public Service

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A list of the 37 sites and maps of the locations are available at: https://housing.novascotia.ca/programs/land-for-housing 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province has identified 37 sites from the provincial land inventory that could be used to build housing, including affordable housing, for thousands of Nova Scotians.

“I made a commitment to Nova Scotians to identify provincial land to create more housing stock and these sites represent a potential future home for thousands of people,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “While there is still work that needs to be done on these sites, we know communities across the province need housing and this inventory now gives more options to increase supply.”

Five of the sites are ready for proposals:
-- sites 29, 30 and 31 on Tremain Crescent, Windsor, West Hants
-- Site 35 on Chapel, Mechanic and Elm streets, Springhill, Cumberland County
-- Site 38 including six residential lots, Liverpool, Queens County.

In March, the Province also made a piece of land in downtown Dartmouth available for a mixed-use project that includes affordable housing. Proposals are currently being evaluated by Develop Nova Scotia.

A separate pilot project was announced last year for provincially owned lands at 1 Circassion Drive in Cole Harbour. The Dartmouth Non-Profit Housing Society was the successful proponent to support the construction of up to 18 new affordable units on that property. Planning is now underway.

The Department continues to work on 31 of the sites to ensure housing suitability. When this work is approved, lands will be made available for proposals.  Each site goes through a due diligence process, including environmental studies, traffic sight line studies and planning analysis, and considers access to services like sidewalks and schools.

Work continues on identifying additional parcels from the provincial land inventory, with future development proposals that include affordable housing given preference.

Quotes:
“I am pleased to see this process identify provincially owned land for housing development throughout the province, including some lots that are part of the Nova Scotia Lands portfolio. This increased supply of land for housing will benefit these three communities and others in the future.”
     - Kim Masland, Minister of Public Works

""On behalf of the Municipality of Cumberland, I want to thank the Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs for making provincial lands in Springhill available for housing development. We, like other communities in Nova Scotia, are facing a housing crisis and look forward to working with developers to see new housing opportunities in our municipality.""
     - Murray Scott, Mayor, Municipality of Cumberland

“We are pleased to be selected as the successful proponent for the Circassion Drive property. Our non-profit organization is committed to constructing affordable housing for residents of Dartmouth. The contribution of this site will help to ensure new affordable units remain affordable for the community for generations.”
     - Nick Russell, CEO, Dartmouth Non-Profit Housing Society

Quick Facts:
-- in his mandate letter, the Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs was directed to develop a full inventory of lands owned by the Province and identify areas that could be used for housing
-- the Municipal Affairs and Housing 2022-23 budget included $900,000 to support the development of an inventory list
-- Dartmouth Non-Profit Housing Society is a housing provider based in Dartmouth, providing affordable housing solutions for Nova Scotians since 1982

"Health and Wellness","Politique de transfert direct au triage en vigueur le 1er juin","SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Politique de transfert direct au triage en vigueur le 1er juin
-----------------------------------------------------------
Une nouvelle initiative des Services de santé d'urgence (SSU) dans les services d'urgence des hôpitaux permettra aux ambulances de reprendre la route plus rapidement pour répondre aux appels d'urgence en temps opportun.

À compter du mercredi 1er juin, les ambulanciers paramédicaux transféreront les patients à faible risque à la salle d'attente du service d'urgence aux fins d'évaluation par le personnel de soins de santé. Auparavant, les ambulanciers devaient attendre avec les patients jusqu'à ce qu'un médecin soit disponible. Un patient à faible risque est une personne dont les signes vitaux sont normaux et qui peut s'asseoir, se lever et se déplacer sans aide et sans risque de chute.

« Les ambulanciers paramédicaux sont essentiels à notre système de soins de santé. Nous devons faire en sorte qu'ils puissent répondre aux appels d'urgence, affirme Michelle Thompson, ministre de la Santé et du Mieux-être. Cette politique contrebalance la sécurité des patients qui peuvent attendre pour être évalués par le personnel du service d'urgence et la nécessité pour les ambulanciers de reprendre la route plus rapidement. »

Les ambulanciers paramédicaux continueront d'attendre avec les patients à risque élevé, par exemple les patients qui semblent avoir subi un accident vasculaire cérébral, qui ont des douleurs thoraciques ou d'autres blessures potentiellement mortelles, ainsi qu'avec les enfants de moins de 16 ans, entre autres.

La politique de transfert direct au triage est l'une de plusieurs initiatives visant à réduire la pression sur le système des SSU, à améliorer le temps de déchargement des ambulances et améliorer les conditions de travail pour les ambulanciers paramédicaux.

Les autres initiatives incluent, notamment :
-- Expansion du service de transport médical et des unités de transfert des patients, deux services qui réduisent le besoin de recourir à une ambulance pour transporter des patients qui sont à faible risque et qui n'ont pas besoin de soins médicaux pendant le transport
-- Augmentation du budget des SSU de près de 12 millions de dollars en 2022-2023 
-- Poursuite de la mise en oeuvre des recommandations du rapport Fitch sur le service d'ambulance dans la province
-- Achat et installation de civières et de chargeurs à levage assisté dans les ambulances
-- Création d'un permis temporaire, en partenariat avec le Collège des ambulanciers paramédicaux de la Nouvelle-Écosse, qui permet aux diplômés récents de commencer à travailler dans leur domaine plus rapidement en attendant de faire leurs examens menant à l'obtention du permis
-- Ajout de véhicules et de personnel pour doubler la capacité de transfert de patients et permettre aux ambulanciers paramédicaux de se concentrer sur les urgences
-- Création d'un conseil consultatif d'employés
-- Collaboration avec l'employeur et les établissements d'enseignement pour le recrutement et le maintien en poste

C'est un avantage pour tout le monde lorsque nos ambulanciers peuvent retourner dans leur communauté plus rapidement.

"Health and Wellness","Direct to Triage Policy Effective June 1","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Direct to Triage Policy Effective June 1
-----------------------------------------------------------
A new Emergency Health Services (EHS) initiative at hospital emergency departments will get paramedics and ambulances back on the road faster so they can respond to emergency calls sooner.

Starting Wednesday, June 1, paramedics will take low-risk patients to the emergency department waiting room to be assessed by healthcare staff. Previously, paramedics had to wait with patients until a doctor took over their care. A low-risk patient is anyone who has normal vital signs and can sit, stand or move independently without risk of falling.

“Paramedics are a vital part of our healthcare system. We need to make sure their time is spent responding to emergencies,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “This policy balances the safety of patients who can wait to be seen by emergency department staff and getting our paramedics back on the streets sooner.”

Paramedics will continue to wait with high-risk patients, such as patients with suspected stroke, chest pain or other potentially life-threatening injuries, and children under 16, among others.

The direct to triage policy is one of several initiatives designed to reduce pressure on the EHS system, improve ambulance offload times and improve working conditions for paramedics.

Other initiatives include:
-- expansion of the Medical Transport Service and Patient Transfer Units, both of which reduce the reliance on ambulances to transport patients who are low-risk and do not need medical oversight during transport
-- increasing the EHS budget by almost $12 million for 2022-2023 
-- continuing to implement recommendations from the Fitch report on ambulance service in the province
-- the purchase and installation of power loaders and power stretchers in all ambulances
-- the creation of a temporary licence, in partnership with the College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia, so graduating paramedics can start working in their field sooner while waiting to write licensing exams
-- new vehicles and staff to double patient transfer capacity and enable paramedics to focus on emergencies
-- establishing an Employee Advisory Council
-- working collaboratively with the employer and paramedic schools on recruitment and retention.

Quotes:
“Watching calls join the queue while you wait with a low-risk patient in hospital is hard. When our paramedics are able to get back into their communities sooner, that benefits everyone. We are hopeful that this new policy is a positive step toward getting our paramedics back to doing what they do best – responding to emergencies.”
     - Kevin MacMullin, Business Manager, International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 727

“Our hope is this initiative results in paramedic crews being released from hospitals more efficiently to respond to medical emergencies provincewide while ensuring no disruption to quality patient care.”

--------------------------------------------------------
A new set of fines will help protect the province’s wildlife habitat and watercourses.

Summary offence tickets with fines ranging from $812.50 to $1,157.50 can now be issued for offences under the Wildlife Habitat and Watercourses Protection Regulations.

Under the Forests Act, the regulations protect water quality and wildlife habitat on private and Crown lands where forestry operations take place. Conservation officers enforce these regulations. Summary offence tickets are now added to their range of existing compliance tools including education, written or verbal warnings or a charge that requires appearing in court.

Fines can now be issued for 18 offences, such as failing to establish special management zones, operating a forestry vehicle too close to a watercourse or creating a tree canopy opening larger than 15 metres.

Quick Facts:
-- the fines have been added to the Summary Offence Tickets Regulations
-- no changes to the Wildlife Habitat and Watercourses Protection Regulations were required to implement the summary offence tickets
-- these regulations, in place since 2002, will be reviewed next winter to ensure they are effectively protecting wildlife as intended
-- reviewing these regulations was a recommendation in the independent review of forestry practices in Nova Scotia by Prof. Bill Lahey

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is using National Tourism Week, from May 29 to June 4, as an opportunity to encourage people to travel to and within Nova Scotia this year. 

Tourism Nova Scotia has launched an advertising campaign encouraging Nova Scotians to support local tourism businesses by booking staycations this summer. The $150,000 campaign includes TV, digital and social media advertising. Campaigns aimed at attracting visitors from farther away were launched earlier this spring in other key markets in North America and overseas.

“Nova Scotia has a wealth of beautiful towns, exciting events and live music, world-class wines and seafood, rich culture and so much more that we are excited to share with the world,” said Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “We have invested in tourism businesses and airports to help with recovery from the global pandemic and we are pleased to hear that tourism bookings and activities are ramping up for 2022.” 

In 2021-22, the Province invested $30.6 million in programs that supported more than 1,800 tourism businesses and organizations, including $12 million in March to support tourism recovery and programs for marketing, product development and digital adoption.

National Tourism Week is an annual event organized by the Tourism Industry Association of Canada to champion and promote Canada’s destinations, tourism businesses and employees.

Quick Facts:
-- Budget 2022-23 included an additional $2 million for Tourism Nova Scotia to focus on local tourism and increase tourism revenues
-- the Province is investing about $9.1 million in advertising campaigns to promote Nova Scotia as a vacation destination in 2022-23
-- in May, the Province announced $13 million for Halifax Stanfield International Airport’s Air Access Fund, and $6.3 million for infrastructure improvements and an Air Access Fund at the J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport 
-- in 2021, Nova Scotia welcomed 882,600 non-resident visitors, an increase of 13 per cent compared to estimates for 2020, when the pandemic severely restricted travel
-- tourism revenue estimates for 2021 are about $1 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2019

A blue-green algae mat is being reported in a stream between Shubenacadie-Grand Lake and Fish Lake today, May 28. 

The rain and wind this weekend may transport the mat to shorelines where people and pets may easily come into contact with it.
 
The Department launched a public education campaign this month to help Nova Scotians be more aware of blue-green algae and the steps they should take to be safe where it may be present. A new updated website includes photos and descriptions of what to look for, an educational video and a fact sheet: https://novascotia.ca/blue-green-algae/ 

Reports of blue-green algae will be posted on this website and the Department’s Twitter account. Nova Scotians are urged to monitor this website for information and updates.
 
Blue-green algae tends to develop when a period of hot, dry weather is followed by a heavy rainfall. It’s becoming more common because of warmer temperatures and more intense storms caused by climate change.

Blue-green algae sightings should be reported to a local Environment and Climate Change office by calling 1-877-936-8476.

An investment of more than $2 million by the Province and the federal government will support the redevelopment of the oyster industry in the Bras d’Or Lake by addressing the spread of a devastating parasite and providing oyster seed.

The support to the Verschuren Centre for Sustainability in Energy and the Environment in Sydney was announced today, May 27, by Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Steve Craig and Mike Kelloway, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, and Member of Parliament for Cape Breton-Canso.

“This investment is a positive step to re-establishing a strong local oyster industry in Cape Breton. It will help our seafood industry remain sustainable and provide top-quality seafood products to the world. We are excited to join with our federal and industry partners in these important investments,” said Minister Craig. 

The centre will develop a land-based oyster hatchery to prepare breeding stock and provide healthy larvae to Bras d’Or Lake oyster growers. Its lab will decontaminate equipment and water to prevent the spread of Multinucleate Sphere Unknown X disease (MSX), which has sidelined the industry on the Bras d’Or Lake for the past 15 years. Previously, the area saw about 80 per cent of oyster landings in Nova Scotia and was a contributor to the local economy.

The support comes from the $400-million Atlantic Fisheries Fund, jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments, which focuses on increasing opportunities and market value for sustainably sourced, high-quality fish and seafood products from Atlantic Canada. Now in its fifth of seven years, the program is open to applications from the commercial fisheries and aquaculture industry, Indigenous groups, academia, and industry associations and organizations, including research institutions.

Quotes:
“The Atlantic Fisheries Fund encourages innovative ways to harvest, process and deliver high-quality, sustainably sourced fish and seafood from the region’s commercial fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The work happening at the Verschuren Centre is key to the rebirth of a once thriving oyster industry in the Bras d’Or Lake, and a welcome infusion of high-quality oyster into Nova Scotia’s fish and seafood sector.”  
      - Joyce Murray, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard

“Atlantic Fisheries Fund support for this project will truly deliver community and industry benefits to lease holders in the Bras D’Or Lake Biosphere. The revitalization of this key shellfish sector – through a novel mitigation strategy, seed nursery and hatchery – will enrich this world-renowned jewel for all who live, work and depend upon it for their livelihood.” 
     - Beth Mason, President and CEO, Verschuren Centre for Sustainability in Energy and the Environment

Quick Facts:
-- the Atlantic Fisheries Fund will invest more than $400 million over seven years to support Canada’s fish and seafood sector
-- the federal government will provide 70 per cent of the funding, with 30 per cent coming from the Atlantic provinces
-- the fund aims to help Canada’s seafood sector transition to meet growing market demands for products that are high quality, value-added and sustainably sourced
-- eligible projects must focus on innovation, infrastructure or science partnerships

------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture is a vital part of the region’s economy and workforce and an important contributor to local food supply. 

Today, May 26, Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow hosted his colleagues from the other three Atlantic provinces to discuss approaches for the next agricultural policy framework, emerging issues and potential collaboration opportunities to support agriculture producers.

“The global pandemic highlighted the importance of local agriculture and food supply chains, and that also applies to Atlantic Canada. Making sure our farms are healthy and sustainable is a top priority for each of us,” said Minister Morrow. “We need to help ensure our farmers can achieve that goal while facing rising costs that also result from global conditions.”

Among other items, the group discussed rising production costs, mental health of farmers and emergency preparedness. 

Quotes:
“I was pleased to participate in this valuable gathering to discuss common concerns and compare notes on best practices. In looking at the next policy framework at the national level, it is critical that the Atlantic provinces are unified in our support for the agricultural sector and increasing production. The new framework is meant to position our agri-food producers and processors and others in the sector as world leaders in sustainable agriculture and enable a globally competitive sector. My department looks forward to continuing to work with our Atlantic colleagues representing the region’s needs. Our agriculture sector is an important part of New Brunswick’s economy.”
     - Margaret Johnson, Minister of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries, New Brunswick

“As we have through the heights of the pandemic, it’s important for agriculture leaders in the region to continue to work together and identify areas of need as well as opportunities for growth in our industry. While we know that local and regional agriculture sectors are experiencing similar difficulties due to global constraints, we also know that with collaboration and support our farmers can continue to lead our communities towards an economic and environmentally sustainable future, and we look forward to the work ahead.”
     - Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Agriculture and Land, Prince Edward Island

“Current global issues affecting the agriculture sector are hitting close to home and serve as a strong reminder of the close connection Atlantic Canadians share. I am grateful for the support and co-operation of our Atlantic counterparts as we continue working together to increase food self-sufficiency, and continue building a strong, sustainable agriculture sector for the future.”
     - Derrick Bragg, Minister of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture, Newfoundland and Labrador

Quick Facts:
-- the next agricultural policy framework is being developed by the federal, provincial and territorial governments to provide agriculture policy and programming; it will replace the Canadian Agriculture Program when it expires March 31, 2023

--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 1,584 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 40 hospitalizations and 13 deaths during the seven-day period ending May 23. The number of new cases – including those linked to long-term care outbreaks – continues to decline, as does the number of new hospitalizations. 

“The pandemic isn’t over, but as we make our way out of this latest Omicron wave, I’m optimistic about what summer may hold in Nova Scotia,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “I know we’re all looking forward to reconnecting with friends, family and loved ones. There are ways to do that safely and in a way that protects those at high risk: gather outside when you can, stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines and, if you’re sick, stay home.”         

Age continues to be the factor most closely related to severe outcomes from COVID-19: 
-- since the beginning of the Omicron waves on December 8, 2021, the median age of lab-confirmed cases is 43, while the median age for hospitalizations and deaths is nearly double, at 71 and 81 respectively 
-- the risk of hospitalization is more than 10 times higher for those 70 and older compared to people under 50 and the risk of death is more than 110 times higher 
-- of the 13 deaths reported this week, 11 (85 per cent) were in people 70 and older and 7 (54 per cent) were in long-term care.

COVID-19 vaccines provide the best layer of protection against severe outcomes. Most people aged 12 to 69 are well protected by a two-dose primary series plus one booster. Immunity from vaccine wanes more quickly in people 70 and older. People in this age category are also more likely to need hospitalization or to die from COVID-19. For these reasons, a second booster dose of vaccine is recommended for this age group. 

To date, 65.6 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose and 59,631 people have received a second. 

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations.

--------------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale 1 584 nouveaux cas confirmés en laboratoire, 40 hospitalisations et 13 décès liés à la COVID-19 au cours de la période de sept jours se terminant le 23 mai. Le nombre de nouveaux cas, y compris les cas liés aux établissements de soins de longue durée, et le nombre d'hospitalisations continuent de diminuer. 

« La pandémie n'est pas terminée, mais alors que nous arrivons à la fin de cette vague Omicron, je suis optimiste pour l'été en Nouvelle-Écosse, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Je sais que nous avons tous hâte de retrouver nos amis, nos familles et nos proches. Il y a des façons de se rassembler tout en protégeant les personnes les plus à risque, soit se rassembler à l'extérieur dans la mesure du possible, se faire vacciner contre la COVID-19 et rester à la maison en cas de maladie. »         

L'âge continue d'être le facteur le plus étroitement lié à des complications graves découlant de la COVID-19 : 
-- Depuis le début des vagues Omicron le 8 décembre 2021, l'âge médian des personnes dont le cas de COVID-19 a été confirmé par un test PCR est de 43 ans, alors que l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées et décédées est de 71 et 81 ans respectivement. 
-- Le risque d'hospitalisation est plus de 10 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est plus de 110 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. 
-- Parmi les 13 décès signalés cette semaine, 11 personnes (85 %) étaient âgées de 70 ans ou plus et 7 personnes (54 %) vivaient dans un établissement de soins de longue durée.

La vaccination contre la COVID-19 offrir la meilleure protection contre les complications graves. La plupart des gens de 12 à 69 ans sont bien protégés par une série primaire de deux doses plus une dose de rappel. L'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus. Les gens de ce groupe d'âge sont plus susceptibles d'être hospitalisés ou de mourir de la COVID-19, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel est recommandée pour ces personnes. 

Jusqu'à présent, 65,6 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel, et 59 631 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel. 

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Santé publique pour lutter contre la pandémie.

--------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture, through the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board, is making the largest addition in decades to the province’s community pasture land for farmers.

The board has purchased 125 hectares of land in Cape John, Pictou County, for $1.1 million. It brings the total area of active community pastures across Nova Scotia to more than 2,500 hectares.

“We are working with the Farm Loan Board to help cattle farmers reduce their cost of production of local beef in Nova Scotia and reduce barriers to entry for new farmers by expanding community pasture land,” said Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow. “By helping farmers reduce costs, we are supporting affordable, local food for Nova Scotians.”

Community pastures are owned by the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board and are leased and operated by independent co-operatives run by volunteers dedicated to the beef industry and the farmers who use the community lands to raise cattle.

Quotes:
""The value of the community pasture to our farm is twofold: by sending part of my herd to the community pasture each summer, it frees up land on the farm so I can grow more forage crops to feed animals over winter and thereby expand the size of my herd.  Also, we feel secure that our animals are well cared for on the community pasture by experienced staff.""

“Community pastures have served the beef and grazing farms of Nova Scotia faithfully for many years. Today, it is becoming increasingly apparent that our future is connected more than ever to our grasslands, for feeding people and capturing carbon. All Nova Scotians can be proud of the idyllic beauty of the community pastures and the legacy of devoted land management.”
     - Dan Thompson, Secretary, Cape John Community Pasture Co-operative Limited

Quick Facts:
-- the Community Pasture Program began in the 1950s

---------------------------------------------------------
Vingt et une personnes de partout en Nouvelle-Écosse ont été choisies pour participer à la Table de consultation sur la petite enfance de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Les membres de la table fourniront des conseils et une orientation sur les prochaines étapes dans le cadre du plan quinquennal de la Province pour transformer les services à la petite enfance grâce à l'Accord entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada. Les membres se rencontreront pour la première fois en juin.

« Nous avons reçu beaucoup de réponses des exploitants, des éducatrices de la petite enfance, des parents, des établissements de formation et d’autres intervenants et j’ai été impressionnée par tous les candidats, de dire Becky Druhan, ministre de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Nous ne pouvons pas aller de l’avant dans ce dossier important sans connaître la perspective des gens visés. La table sera ce lien important et elle aidera à nous orienter dans nos efforts pour bâtir un système de garde d’enfants qui fonctionne pour tous. »

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse auront aussi d’autres occasions d’exprimer leurs commentaires et suggestions sur la réforme du système pour la petite enfance dans le cadre de groupes de travail, de groupes de réflexion et de sondages. 

La Nouvelle-Écosse en est à la première année de mise en œuvre de l’accord quinquennal d’une valeur de 605 millions de dollars. 

Quelque 250 candidatures ont été étudiées en fonction de critères précis, notamment la représentation géographique, l'expérience et les connaissances relatives au système des services de garde d'enfants et la représentation des groupes traditionnellement sous-représentés. 

Tout au long de la mise en œuvre de l’accord, le ministère apportera aussi des changements aux opérations à partir de la rétroaction des exploitants. Les exploitants ont la possibilité de demander des changements à leur capacité d’accueil totale autorisée à la suite d’une suspension des activités vers la fin de l’année dernière pour permettre la planification du système. Par exemple, un centre de garde d’enfants peut demander de réaffecter des places à d’autres endroits ou à d’autres groupes d’âge, en fonction des besoins, et peut demander de ventre son entreprise et son permis avec les modalités et conditions existantes.    

Le ministère prévoit aussi lancer un projet pilote volontaire pour aider les exploitants qui veulent faire passer leur modèle de fonctionnement d’un modèle privé à un modèle sans but lucratif. 

Comme il a été annoncé en janvier, grâce à l'accord, les familles néo-écossaises ont profité d'une réduction moyenne de 25 % des frais de services agréés de garde d'enfants à compter du 1er avril. Cette réduction était rétroactive au 1er janvier 2022. Les familles qui ont un tout-petit pourraient économiser en moyenne 200 $ par mois grâce à cette réduction. Il s'agit de la première étape dans la réduction des frais de garde d'enfants de 2019 de 50 %, en moyenne, d'ici la fin de l'année 2022, et d'un pas vers l'atteinte de l'objectif d'offrir des frais de 10 $ par jour d'ici au 31 mars 2026.

« J’ai vraiment hâte de faire entendre ma voix à la Table en prévision de cette réforme tant attendue du système de garde d’enfants en Nouvelle-Écosse. Je suis également très heureuse pour les enfants et les familles, mais surtout pour toutes les éducatrices de la petite enfance en Nouvelle-Écosse qui s’investissent pleinement dans ce qu’elles font. Elles ont tenu bon et elles auront finalement la rémunération et la reconnaissance qu’elles méritent indéniablement. Le fait de pouvoir être la voix de toutes ces personnes a beaucoup d’importance pour moi, au plan personnel comme au plan professionnel. »

« C’est un honneur pour moi d’être membre de cette table. C’est un grand moment pour la garde et l’apprentissage des jeunes enfants en Nouvelle-Écosse. Mais, comme nous le savons, les changements importants au statu quo s’accompagnent généralement de questions et d’un peu d’incertitude. Il est excellent que les intervenants aient un endroit où présenter leurs questions et fournir leurs idées. Même si nous représentons des perspectives variées, nous avons un but commun qui est de créer un système de garde d’enfants de qualité, abordable, accessible et qui répond aux besoins. Quelle occasion incroyable pour la communauté de la petite enfance et pour les jeunes enfants et leur famille partout en Nouvelle-Écosse. »

---------------------------------------------------------
Twenty-one people from across Nova Scotia have been selected to join the Province’s Early Learning and Child Care Engagement Table. 

The table will provide direct input and guidance on next steps in the Province’s five-year plan to transform child care through the Canada-Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement. Members will meet for the first time in June.

“We received a tremendous response from operators, early childhood educators, parents, training institutions and other stakeholders, and I was truly impressed by the applicants,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “We can’t move on this important work without hearing directly from those who are affected. The table will provide this important link and help steer us as we build a system of child care that cares for everyone.”

Nova Scotians will also have additional opportunities to provide input on the child-care transformation, through initiatives including working groups, focus groups and surveys.

Nova Scotia is currently in the first year of implementing the five-year $605 million agreement. 

About 250 applications were reviewed based on criteria including geographic representation, knowledge of and experience with the child-care system, and representation from traditionally under-represented groups.

As the agreement is implemented, the Department is also making operational changes based on operator feedback. Operators again have the flexibility to apply for changes under their total licensed capacity following a hold issued late last year to allow for system planning. For example, a centre can apply to reallocate spaces for other locations or age ranges, based on needs, and can apply to sell a business and licence under existing terms and conditions.   

The Department also plans to launch a voluntary pilot project to support operators who want to transition their business model from private to not-for-profit. 

As announced in January, through the agreement, families in Nova Scotia saw a 25 per cent reduction, on average, in child-care fees as of April 1, retroactive to January 1, 2022, for children in regulated child-care spaces. This reduction means a savings, on average, of $200 per month for parents with a toddler in child care. This is an initial step in reducing 2019 child-care fees for Nova Scotian families by 50 per cent, on average, by the end of 2022, and in achieving an average of $10-a-day care by March 31, 2026.

Quotes:
“Every child deserves the best start in life. The work of Nova Scotia’s new Early Learning and Child Care Engagement Table will help strengthen early learning and child care and ensure the system works for all families no matter where they live. We will continue to work with Nova Scotia to help ensure that children have access to the high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning and child care they need to succeed.”
     - Karina Gould, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development

“I am excited and eager to have my voice at the table for this long-awaited transformation in early learning and child care in Nova Scotia. I am also excited for children and families, but especially for each and every early childhood educator in Nova Scotia who puts everything into what they do. They have prevailed and will finally have the compensation and recognition they undeniably deserve. It means a lot to me personally and professionally that I can be a voice for all.”
      - Kimberly Cormier, Engagement Table member and child care operator, Antigonish

“I am honoured to be a member at this table. This is an exciting time for early learning and child care in Nova Scotia. But, as we know, whenever there is significant change to the status quo it is accompanied by questions and some uncertainty. It is excellent that stakeholders will have a place to bring their questions and provide their input. Although we represent various perspectives, we have a common goal of creating a quality, affordable, accessible and responsive system of early learning and child care. What an incredible opportunity for both the early childhood community and for young children and their families throughout Nova Scotia.” 
     - Christine McLean, Engagement Table member, Mount Saint Vincent University Associate Professor, Child & Youth Study, Halifax 

Quick Facts:
-- a call for applications to the Early Learning and Child Care Engagement Table was issued in March 2022 and the deadline to apply was April 8, 2022
-- work continues on Nova Scotia’s Excellence in Early Childhood Education workforce strategy, which will result in higher wages and benefits for early childhood educators by this fall
-- virtually all child-care centres are funded through an annual funding agreement, meaning the majority of parents that access licensed child care qualify for the current 25 per cent fee reduction and future reductions
-- the Government of Canada is making a transformative investment to build a Canada-wide early learning and child-care system in partnership with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners; this includes a historic federal investment of almost $605 million for Nova Scotia from 2021-22 to 2025-26, in addition to $58 million over the same four years for the Canada-Nova Scotia Early Learning and Child Care Extension Agreement and a one-time investment of about $10.9 million in 2021-22 to support Nova Scotia’s early childhood workforce
-- Nova Scotia invests $132.6 million in early learning and child care annually, including $54 million for pre-primary and over $75 million for the child-care sector

--------------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale 2 513 nouveaux cas confirmés en laboratoire, 59 hospitalisations et 24 décès liés à la COVID-19 au cours de la période de sept jours se terminant le 16 mai. Le nombre de nouveaux cas, y compris les cas liés aux établissements de soins de longue durée, et le nombre d'hospitalisations continuent de diminuer depuis depuis le pic de la sixième vague en avril.

« La diminution du nombre de nouveaux cas et d'hospitalisations est positive, mais mes pensées accompagnent les 24 familles qui ont perdu un proche en raison de la COVID-19, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La vaccination, le port du masque et le fait de rester à la maison en cas de maladie sont des petits gestes de respect pour ces familles et pour les nombreuses autres personnes dont la vie a été touchée et est encore touchée par ce virus. »

En général, les données démontrent que le risque d'hospitalisation est près de 11 fois plus élevé et le risque de décès est près de 114 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes plus jeunes. Parmi les 24 décès signalés cette semaine, 22 personnes (91.7 %) étaient âgées de 70 ans ou plus. Neuf personnes (37.5 %) vivaient dans un établissement de soins de longue durée.

La vaccination continue d'offrir une protection considérable contre les complications graves dans tous les groupes d'âge. Bien que le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès soit plus élevé pendant la vague Omicron que pendant les vagues précédentes, y compris chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, les taux sont moins élevés en général, en partie grâce à la vaccination. Toutefois, les données démontrent que l'immunité offerte par le vaccin décroît plus rapidement chez les personnes âgées de 70 ans ou plus, et c'est pourquoi une deuxième dose de rappel est recommandée pour ces personnes.

Les personnes non vaccinées sont toujours les plus à risque de subir des complications graves dans tous les groupes d'âge. Les données indiquent que trois doses du vaccin, soit une série primaire complète et une dose de rappel, réduisent le risque d'hospitalisation de 85 % et le risque de décès de plus de 92 %.

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Santé publique pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés. Le rapport complet se trouve ici : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#epidemiologic-summaries (rapport en anglais seulement)

Pour la période de sept jours se terminant le 16 mai :
 -- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 2 513 ont donné un résultat positif.
 -- Cinquante-neuf nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19.
 -- Durant cette période, 24 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.
 
Depuis le début de la cinquième vague (le 8 décembre 2021) :
 -- L'âge médian des personnes dont le cas de COVID-19 a été confirmé par un test PCR est de 43 ans.
 -- L'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées est de 71 ans.
 -- L'âge médian des personnes décédées est de 81 ans.
 
Au 19 mai, 65,5 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel, et 52 725 personnes ont reçu une quatrième dose du vaccin.

Faits en bref
-- La sixième vague de la pandémie a débuté le 1er mars.
-- D'autres virus respiratoires circulent également dans la province. Pendant la semaine se terminant le 14 mai, 25 nouveaux cas de grippe ont été signalés et 84 % de ces cas sont chez des gens de 44 ans ou moins.

--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 2,513 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19, 59 hospitalizations and 24 deaths during the seven-day period ending May 16. The number of new cases – including those linked to long-term care facility outbreaks – and the number of new hospital admissions continue to decline, as they have since the peak of the sixth wave in April.

“Declines in new cases and hospitalizations are welcome news, but my thoughts are with the 24 families who’ve lost their loved ones to COVID-19,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, staying home when we’re sick – these are small signs of respect to those families and to the many others whose lives have been, and still are, impacted by this virus.”

Overall, the data show that the risk of hospitalization is nearly 11 times higher, and the risk of death is nearly 114 times higher for people 70 and older compared to younger people. Of the 24 deaths reported this week, 22 people (91.7 per cent) were 70 years of age or older. Nine people (37.5 per cent) lived in long-term care facilities.

Vaccination continues to offer significant protection against severe outcomes across all age groups. While the number of hospitalizations and deaths during the Omicron waves has been higher than in previous waves – including among people 70 and older – the overall rates have been lower, due in part to protection from vaccine. However, evidence shows that immunity gained from vaccine wanes more quickly among those 70 and older, which is why a second booster dose is recommended for this group.

Across all age groups, the unvaccinated continue to be at highest risk of severe disease. The data show that having three doses of vaccine – a full primary series and a booster – reduces the risk of hospitalization by 85 per cent and the risk of death by more than 92 per cent.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform public health’s management of the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The full report is available here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

For the seven-day period ending May 16:
 -- there were 2,513 new PCR-confirmed cases
 -- there were 59 new hospitalizations due to COVID-19
 -- there were 24 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system.
 
Since the start of the fifth wave (December 8, 2021):
 -- the median age of PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 43
 -- the median age of hospitalizations is 71
 -- the median age of reported deaths is 81.
 
As of May 19, 65.5 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose and 52,725 people have received a fourth dose of vaccine.

Quick Facts:
-- the sixth wave of the pandemic started March 1
-- other respiratory viruses are also in the province, and there were 25 new cases of influenza reported for the week ending May 14; 84 per cent were in people 44 years of age or younger

------------------------------------------------------
Le ministère de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance n'exigera plus le port du masque dans les écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse à compter du mardi 24 mai.

Aujourd'hui 19 mai, Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, a annoncé que le port du masque sera toujours recommandé et que les élèves, les membres du personnel, les fournisseurs de services externes, les bénévoles et les visiteurs qui choisissent de continuer de porter un masque seront libres de le faire.

Selon la ministre Druhan, le port du masque a aidé les écoles à atténuer l'impact de la sixième vague de COVID-19. Toutefois, le temps chaud de juin approche et les classes pourront passer plus de temps à l'extérieur, et compte tenu de l'amélioration des données sur l'assiduité et la santé dans les écoles de la Nouvelle-Écosse, la ministre Druhan est d'avis qu'il est maintenant temps de rendre le port du masque facultatif dans les écoles.

« Pendant la pandémie, nous avons travaillé en étroite collaboration avec la Santé publique et nous avons pris les mesures nécessaires pour assurer la sécurité du personnel et des élèves, souligne la ministre Druhan. Nous encourageons fortement les élèves et le personnel à continuer de porter le masque, nous continuerons d'appuyer le personnel et les élèves et de fournir des masques et du désinfectant pour les mains. »

La ministre Druhan ajoute que toutes les provinces du Canada ont éliminé le port du masque obligatoire dans les écoles.

On demande aux élèves, au personnel et aux visiteurs de continuer de respecter les mesures de base en matière de santé publique, y compris se faire vacciner s'ils sont admissibles, rester à la maison s'ils ne se sentent pas bien, utiliser la liste de contrôle quotidien pour la COVID-19 et se laver et désinfecter les mains souvent.

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Mask Requirement Removed in Public Schools","COVID-19/EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Mask Requirement Removed in Public Schools
--------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development will remove the mask requirement in Nova Scotia’s public schools beginning Tuesday, May 24.

Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, said today, May 19, that masks will continue to be recommended and that those students, staff, outside service providers, volunteers and visitors who choose to wear a mask will be supported.

Minister Druhan said masks helped schools mitigate the impact of COVID-19’s sixth wave. But as warmer weather approaches in June and classes can spend more time outdoors, and with Nova Scotia’s health data and school attendance data improving, Minister Druhan said now is the time to make masks optional in schools.

“Throughout the pandemic, we’ve worked closely with public health and taken steps to keep staff and students safe,” said Minister Druhan. “We strongly encourage students and staff to continue to wear masks, and we will continue to support staff and students as well as continue to supply masks and hand sanitizer.”

Minister Druhan said all provinces in Canada have removed mask mandates in schools.

Students, staff and visitors are also asked to continue to follow core public health measures, including getting vaccinated if eligible, staying home if feeling unwell, following the COVID-19 daily checklist, and washing and sanitizing hands frequently.

"Public Prosecution Service","Second Crown Attorney Appointed to Human Trafficking Cases","PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE--Second Crown Attorney Appointed to Human Trafficking Cases
------------------------------------------------------------
Senior Crown attorney Alicia Kennedy has been appointed to the prosecution team dedicated to human trafficking offences in Nova Scotia.

In its 2022-2023 budget, the government provided the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service (PPS) with an additional $328,000 to add a Crown attorney, legal assistant, paralegal and training resources to combat human trafficking.

In addition to conducting prosecutions, the team provides training to Crown attorneys across the province on human trafficking issues. The team also works collaboratively with other justice partners in the effort to tackle the broader problem of human trafficking.

Ms. Kennedy joins senior Crown attorney Josie McKinney, who was appointed in 2020 as the province’s first Crown attorney dedicated to the prosecution of human trafficking offences.

Ms. Kennedy, a 2007 graduate of Dalhousie Law School, joined the PPS in 2009 and has prosecuted hundreds of criminal cases, including homicides and sexual assaults. In 2019, she undertook a 20-month assignment as one of two Crown attorneys dedicated to sexual assault prosecutions. In addition to conducting prosecutions, Ms. Kennedy trained other Crown attorneys and developed legal briefs and research to support them in sexual assault prosecutions.

Quotes:
“Human trafficking is a particularly heinous offence against the most vulnerable victims. This government is focused on supporting the victims and bringing the perpetrators to justice. Establishing a team at the PPS goes a long way in those efforts.”
     - Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice

Quick Facts:
-- Ms. Kennedy articled with Legal Aid Saskatchewan and was appointed a staff lawyer there in 2008
-- in 2013, she spent several months as a visiting professional at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands
-- Nova Scotia has the highest rate of human trafficking incidents in the country with 2.1 per 100,000 people
-- currently, there are about 15 active human trafficking and related cases before Nova Scotia courts; most of the cases involve multiple victims

Twenty-five rinks in need of upgrades and repairs are receiving more than $1 million through the Province’s Rink Revitalization Fund.

“Rinks support community health and well-being, and provide invaluable contributions to local economies, especially in our rural towns,” said Dave Ritcey, MLA for Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “By investing in rinks, we are creating local jobs, encouraging active lifestyles and promoting our province’s social and cultural identity.”

The Rink Revitalization Fund helps community groups, municipalities and not-for-profit organizations invest in infrastructure to support the sustainability of their facilities. Rinks include curling clubs, arenas and permanent seasonal outdoor rinks that are open to the public.

For example, the Central Nova Scotia Civic Centre Society received $122,000 to upgrade the Zamboni and score clock at the Rath Eastlink Community Centre in Truro.

Quotes:
“We are incredibly pleased to receive funding from the provincial Rink Revitalization Fund. The addition of a new centre-ice video jumbotron will enable us to elevate the fan experience and attract a broader range of national and international events to the region. Also, through this fund, the Rath Eastlink Community Centre will continue to prioritize our venue’s commitment to environmental sustainability with the acquisition of an electric-powered Zamboni. Thank you to the Province of Nova Scotia and our local stakeholders for supporting our vision for sustainable operations!”

"Environment and Climate Change","Public Education Campaign on Blue-green Algae","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Public Education Campaign on Blue-green Algae
----------------------------------------------------------
A new public education campaign will help Nova Scotians become more aware of blue-green algae when enjoying the province’s outdoors with the arrival of warmer weather.

Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are naturally occurring in fresh water like lakes, ponds, rivers and streams. They can flourish in water high in nutrients, especially during hot, dry conditions. The bacteria can be harmful to people and fatal for animals, so it is important that Nova Scotians know what to look for and how to protect themselves, their families and pets.

“Nova Scotians are noticing the impacts of climate change and seeing more blue-green algae is a perfect example,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr, on behalf of Environment and Climate Change Minister Timothy Halman. “We want everyone to enjoy water activities and all Nova Scotia has to offer, but safely. Knowing what to look for allows people to be alert and make informed decisions.”

The public education campaign will include a website dedicated to information about and reports of blue-green algae, including photos of what to look for; an educational video; advertising; social media posts; signs at provincial beaches; and posters and resource materials.

Some of the key information for Nova Scotians includes:
-- people should always scan the water and shoreline before entering the water or letting children or pets play in it
-- swimming in contaminated water can lead to itchy, irritated eyes and skin
-- swallowing or inhaling the water can cause headaches, fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
-- pets may be attracted to the smell of algae mats and ingestion could be fatal. 
People who see blue-green algae are asked to report it to the local Environment and Climate Change office at: 1-877-936-8476.

Quotes:
“It’s important that Nova Scotians are aware of the health effects blue-green algae can have on people and their pets. As the weather gets warmer – during this summer season and longer term due to climate change – we can expect to see more of these algae blooms. Taking the time to learn what to look for and sharing this information with friends and family will help us to live with blue-green algae as safely as possible.”
     - Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health

Quick Facts:
-- algae blooms can look like fine grass clippings in the water, spilled paint, pea soup or sometimes like a thick scum on the surface
-- algae mats can be found in shallow areas of lakes and rivers and the shoreline
-- mats can look like clumps of vegetation, and can appear black, brown or dark green in the water and may appear grey when on the shoreline
-- blue-green algae can move around, reform and recur, making testing unreliable in large bodies of water

------------------------------------------------------------
Presque 24 000 personnes âgées en Nouvelle-Écosse ont reçu l'Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés depuis le lancement du programme le 1er décembre. L'allocation d'au plus 500 $ aide les personnes âgées à payer le coût de services nécessaires pour leur permettre de vivre dans leur maison plus longtemps. 

Les fonds peuvent servir à payer l'entretien du gazon, les petites réparations à la maison, la livraison de l'épicerie et de médicaments, le transport et plus encore. La date limite pour la présentation des demandes est le 31 mai. Les fonds peuvent être utilisés pour des services reçus jusqu'au 30 novembre 2022.  

« Je souhaite que le plus grand nombre possible de personnes âgées puissent profiter de cette allocation, et souvent, elles ont simplement besoin d'un petit coup de main de temps à autre. C'est ce qu'offre ce programme, affirme Barbara Adams, ministre des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée. J'encourage toutes les personnes âgées à déterminer si elles sont admissibles et à présenter une demande avant la fin du mois de mai si ce n'est pas déjà fait. » 

Les personnes admissibles doivent être âgées de 65 ans ou plus. Elles doivent également vivre indépendamment chez elles (seules ou avec un conjoint ou une conjointe) et avoir un revenu net du ménage d’au plus 37 500 $.

Il n'est pas nécessaire de soumettre une preuve de revenu, une preuve que vous êtes propriétaire ou locataire de votre logement ou des reçus au moment de présenter votre demande, mais les personnes admissibles pourraient devoir présenter de tels documents plus tard. Les documents qui peuvent servir à prouver que vous êtes propriétaire ou locataire de votre logement incluent une facture d'impôt foncier, un avis d'évaluation foncière, un bail signé, une confirmation de l'initiative pour l'obtention des titres de propriété, un état de compte de prêt hypothécaire ou une facture de services publics.

Les demandes peuvent être soumises en ligne à l'adresse https://novascotia.ca/seniors-care-grant/fr, par courriel ou par télécopieur. La version papier du formulaire est disponible dans les centres Accès Nouvelle-Écosse et dans les bureaux des députés. Vous pouvez également composer le 1-800-670-4357 pour demander qu'on vous envoie un formulaire par la poste.

Le gouvernement offre aussi des programmes qui aident les personnes âgées à payer les coûts liés aux rénovations et aux réparations de leur maison, au chauffage et à l'impôt foncier.

Le processus de demande est facile, et vous obtiendrez de l'aide pour beaucoup de choses qui pourront vous aider à vivre dans votre maison plus longtemps.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Almost 24,000 older Nova Scotians have received the Seniors Care Grant since applications opened December 1. The grant of up to $500 helps seniors with everyday household expenses so they can stay in their homes longer. 

The grant can be used to pay for lawn care, small household repairs, grocery and medication delivery, transportation and more. The application deadline is May 31. Funds can be used on services up to November 30, 2022.  

“I want as many seniors as possible to benefit from the Seniors Care Grant, and often, they just need a little help with tasks from time to time. That’s what this program is there to do,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “I encourage seniors to find out more and, if they’re eligible, apply by the end of May if they haven’t already.” 

To qualify, Nova Scotians must be aged 65 and older. They must also live independently in a home they own or rent – on their own or with a spouse or partner – and have an annual net household income of $37,500 or less.

Seniors do not need to submit proof of income, home ownership or lease agreement, or receipts when applying. However, those eligible may be asked to provide supporting documents later. To show home ownership or rental status, documents that can be used include a property tax bill, property assessment notice, signed residential lease, Land Titles Initiative confirmation, mortgage statement or utility bill.

Applications can be submitted at: https://beta.novascotia.ca/apply-help-household-costs-seniors-care-grant , by mail or by fax. Application forms are available at Access Nova Scotia centres and MLA offices, or by calling 1-800-670-4357 to request that one be mailed.

The government also has support programs to help seniors with the costs of home repair and modification, heating and property tax.

My message to other seniors is: please find out more about this program to see if you’re eligible. It can help a lot with the things you need to do to stay in your home and it’s easy to apply.”

Des collectivités à l'échelle de la Nouvelle-Écosse auront un meilleur accès aux transports en commun grâce au financement de la Province.

Le gouvernement investit presque 5 millions de dollars dans les services de transports dans le cadre du Programme d'aide au transport communautaire et du Programme d'aide au transport en commun.

« L'accès aux transports est une nécessité pour les gens qui doivent se rendre au travail, à un rendez-vous médical, à l'épicerie, à l'école ou à des activités communautaires, affirme Kim Masland, ministre des Travaux publics. Cet investissement facilitera l'accès à des moyens de transport accessibles et abordables dans les collectivités de la Nouvelle-Écosse. »

Vingt-sept municipalités et organismes communautaires recevront du financement au cours de la présente année financière.

“Access to transportation is a necessity for people who are going to work, attending medical appointments, getting groceries, going to school or participating in community activities,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “This investment will help make it easier for more Nova Scotians to have access to safe, affordable and accessible transportation in their communities.”

Twenty-seven municipalities and community organizations will receive funding this fiscal year.

Quotes:
“As one of 20 community transportation providers across the province, the funds received from the Community Transportation Assistance Program are vital to the operation of our organization. Without this funding, we would not be able to provide the service to residents in our rural communities at an affordable rate for those who have a transportation barrier to get where they need to go.”
     - Susan Taylor, Executive Director, Colchester Transportation Co-operative Ltd.

“The funds from the Public Transportation Assistance Program are essential to the operation of Strait Area Transit. Without this capital funding, we would not be able to provide inclusive, safe, reliable, and accessible transportation to the residents of Inverness County. With the PTAP funding, we can purchase a new vehicle. Our fixed route service helps to reduce social isolation, promote independence, expand employment opportunities, increase access to health care, access to upgrade education and provides transportation to local food banks and other essential services.”
     - Amber Carrigan, Executive Director, Strait Area Transit

Quick Facts:
-- the Community Transportation Assistance Program is providing almost $2 million in operating funding to 20 door-to-door community transportation services
-- the Public Transit Assistance Program is providing $2.9 million to seven municipalities and community organizations providing fixed route transit services; the funding is used toward capital purchases such as new buses

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale 3 118 nouveaux cas confirmés en laboratoire, 65 hospitalisations et 18 décès liés à la COVID-19 au cours de la période de sept jours se terminant le 9 mai. Le nombre de nouveaux cas et de complications graves continue de diminuer depuis le pic de la vague actuelle en avril.

« L'activité virale continue de diminuer en Nouvelle-Écosse, et il s'agit d'une bonne nouvelle. Toutefois, le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès demeure élevé, ce qui est important de ne pas oublier même si la sixième vague tire à sa fin, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. L'augmentation du nombre d'infections causées par d'autres virus respiratoires à l'heure actuelle partout au pays, y compris en Nouvelle-Écosse, est une autre raison de ne pas baisser la garde. »

Le nombre de cas de COVID-19 liés aux établissements de soins de longue durée et aux établissements de soins pour bénéficiaires internes a diminué cette semaine. Il y a eu un plus grand nombre de cas dans les établissements de soins de longue durée pendant les vagues Omicron, soit la cinquième et la sixième vague de la pandémie, qu'au cours des autres vagues, et plus de deux fois plus de cas au cours de la vague actuelle qu'au cours de la cinquième vague. Parmi ces cas de COVID-19, le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès demeure faible en raison de la protection offerte par les vaccins.

Les données contenues dans le sommaire épidémiologique cette semaine démontrent le lien entre l'âge et les complications graves. Le risque d'hospitalisation est environ 10 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de 18 à 49 ans, et le risque de décès est plus de 100 fois plus élevé comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans.

Le fait de recevoir tous les vaccins disponibles, soit toutes les doses régulières et les doses de rappel en fonction de l'âge et de l'état de santé, continue d'offrir une protection considérable contre les complications graves. Une dose de rappel réduit le risque d'hospitalisation de plus de 84 % et le risque de décès de plus de 92 % comparativement aux personnes qui ne sont pas vaccinées ou qui n'ont reçu qu'une seule dose. Le taux de décès chez les personnes non vaccinées ou qui ont reçu une seule dose du vaccin est plus de 13 fois plus élevé que chez les personnes qui ont reçu au moins trois doses.

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés. Le rapport complet se trouve ici : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#epidemiologic-summaries (rapport en anglais seulement) 

Pour la période de sept jours se terminant le 9 mai :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 3 118 ont donné un résultat positif.
-- Soixante-cinq nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19.
-- Durant cette période, 18 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.

Depuis le début de la cinquième vague (le 8 décembre 2021) :
-- L'âge médian des personnes dont le cas de COVID-19 a été confirmé par un test PCR est de 42 ans.
-- L'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées est de 71 ans.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées est de 81 ans.

Au 12 mai, 65,2 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel, et 41 584 personnes ont reçu une quatrième dose du vaccin.

Selon les recommandations du Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation (CCNI), une deuxième dose de rappel est offerte aux résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée et des établissements de soins pour bénéficiaires internes, aux personnes de 70 ans et plus qui vivent dans la communauté et aux membres des Premières Nations âgés de 55 ans ou plus.

La Santé publique publie des rapports sur les événements indésirables associés à la vaccination contre la COVID-19 dans la province. Ces rapports seront maintenant publiés chaque trimestre. Le prochain rapport sera publié en juillet et couvrira la période de trois mois du 1er avril au 30 juin. Les rapports précédents se trouvent ici : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#adverse-events-following-immunization (rapports en anglais seulement).

Grippe et autres virus respiratoires

La saison grippale traditionnelle tire à sa fin, mais une augmentation du nombre d'infections a été remarquée. 

Pendant la semaine se terminant le 7 mai, 32 cas de grippe A ont été confirmés en laboratoire dans la province, et plus de 60 % de ces cas sont chez des enfants de 19 ans ou moins. Ces 32 nouveaux cas représentent plus du quart du nombre signalé de cas de grippe au cours de la saison 2021-2022.

Le rapport hebdomadaire sur les maladies respiratoires, qui inclut les nouveaux cas de grippe, peut être consulté au https://novascotia.ca/dhw/CDPC/respiratory-watch.asp (en anglais seulement).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is reporting 3,118 new lab-confirmed cases, 65 hospitalizations and 18 deaths due to COVID-19 in the seven-day period ending May 9. The number of new infections has continued to decline since the peak of the current wave in April, and severe outcomes continue to decline as well.

“We’re seeing virus activity continue to slow down in Nova Scotia and that’s great news, but the number of hospitalizations and deaths remains high – and that’s important to keep in mind even as we make our way out of the sixth wave,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “The late-spring surge in other respiratory viruses happening across the country right now – including in Nova Scotia – is all the more reason to keep our guard up.”

The number of COVID-19 cases linked to long-term care and residential care facilities is down this week. There have been more cases in long-term care during the Omicron waves – the fifth and sixth waves of the pandemic – than in prior waves and more than twice as many to date in the current wave compared to the fifth. Of those cases, the number of hospitalizations and deaths remains very low because of the protection provided by vaccines.

Data in this week’s epidemiologic report shows the association between age and severe outcomes. The risk of hospitalization is about 10 times higher for those aged 70 years and older compared to those 18 to 49, and the risk of death is more than 100 times higher compared to those under 50.

Staying up to date with vaccines – getting all the doses and boosters available, based on people’s age and health status – continues to offer significant protection against severe outcomes. Having at least one booster dose reduces the risk of hospitalization by more than 84 per cent and the risk of death by more than 92 per cent compared to those who are unvaccinated or have only one dose. Those who are unvaccinated or have only one dose of vaccine have over 13 times the rate of death compared to those with at least three doses.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The full report is available here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries 

For the seven-day period ending May 9:
-- there were 3,118 new PCR-confirmed cases
-- there were 65 new hospitalizations due to COVID-19
-- there were 18 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system.

Since the start of the fifth wave (December 8, 2021):
-- the median age of PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 42
-- the median age of hospitalizations is 71
-- the median age of reported deaths is 81.

As of May 12, 65.2 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose and 41,584 people have received a fourth dose of vaccine.

As recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI),  second booster doses are available to residents of long-term and residential care facilities, adults 70 and over living in the community, and members of First Nations communities 55 and older in Nova Scotia.

Public health reports on adverse events following immunization with the COVID-19 vaccine in the province. These reports will now be released quarterly. The next report will be published in July and will cover the three-month period between April 1 and June 30. Past reports are available here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#adverse-events-following-immunization

Flu and Other Respiratory Viruses

There has also been an increase in flu infections even as the end of the traditional flu season approaches.

For the week ending May 7, there were 32 new lab-confirmed cases of influenza A reported in the province, and more than 60 per cent of those were in children 19 and under. These 32 new cases represent more than a quarter of all reported influenza infections during the 2021-2022 flu season.

----------------------------------------------------------------
People who were in permanent care as children can now access the Province’s Disclosure Program online to request their personal information and documents that may be needed by post-secondary institutions and other organizations.

This means people will be able to get information faster, and those seeking information will be able to access culturally relevant supports.

Previously, requests for information or documents were handled on an individual basis by a social worker assigned through the Department of Community Services.

“We want to support former children in care to have opportunities to build their future in our province,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “I encourage former children in care to reach out to the Disclosure Program to learn more about the Tuition Waiver Program and other services.”

Some post-secondary institutions waive tuition and mandatory program fees or offer bursary programs for former children in care. People who received youth services via a signed agreement when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 may also be eligible for these supports. Disclosure Program staff are available to discuss individual circumstances and the options that may be available.

Quotes:
“This is tremendous news. It will assist those studying or looking to study at NSCC – or other institutions with a similar program – who were in care in Nova Scotia and wish to apply for our college’s Post-Care Free Tuition Program. Allowing the information to be online will help streamline the application process, making it more accessible and helping to open doors to education and opportunity.”
     - Jill Provoe, Acting Vice-President, Academic, Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)

Quick Facts:
-- each year, about 120 young people, ages 19 to 24, transition from child welfare supports
-- streamlined services for former children in care under the Disclosure Program are aligned with open adoption records, legislation that took effect on May 1
-- services provided by the Disclosure Program are available free of charge

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness / Advanced Education","More Medical School Seats to Train Rural Doctors","PREMIER’S OFFICE/HEALTH/WELLNESS/ADVANCED EDUCATION--More Medical School Seats to Train Rural Doctors
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is partnering with post-secondary institutions to train more rural family doctors.

Cape Breton University (CBU) has partnered with Dalhousie University in Halifax to create five new medical school seats this September through the provincially funded strategic health initiative at CBU. To be accepted into the pilot program, students must:
-- meet Dalhousie Medical School admission requirements
-- be a Nova Scotian living in a rural area (including anywhere in Cape Breton)
-- be willing to train full-time at Dalhousie
-- commit to a five-year return of service to practise family medicine in a rural Nova Scotia community (including anywhere in Cape Breton) once their training is complete.

“We need transformational change and out-of-the-box solutions to create the healthcare system Nova Scotians need and deserve,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Today’s announcement is the kind of innovative partnership that will see more family doctors practising on Cape Breton Island and in rural communities, where we know they are needed.”

CBU’s strategic health initiative received $5 million from the Province in March to research and explore new ways to recruit, train and retain more healthcare workers in rural areas of the province, including in Mi’kmaw and African Nova Scotian communities. The medical school seats account for a $1.5-million investment over four years.

CBU will collaborate with Dalhousie to choose students from the Dalhousie Medical School wait-list for the 2022-23 academic year to fill the new seats.

Quotes:
“We are focused on transforming Nova Scotia’s healthcare system, and part of that is bringing more doctors to communities across the province. Nova Scotia is a great place to train and work as a doctor – we have great compensation for family doctors, strong financial incentives, and we are renovating and building new facilities to create modern places to work. Partnerships like this one show how important it is to have everyone working together toward our common goals.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“It is part of my mandate to meet the unprecedented demand for doctors and address the challenges in healthcare. When we invested in CBU’s strategic health initiative, it was to enhance healthcare training, innovation and access to care for Nova Scotians living in rural communities, and this partnership is a perfect example of that intent in action. I am proud to see our post-secondary institutions heeding the call to help find solutions for our rural communities.”
     - Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education

“Dalhousie University has a strong reputation for training high-quality, compassionate doctors and recognizes the need to be collaborative for the purpose of increasing access to healthcare in these areas of need. We are eager to learn whether Nova Scotians will respond favourably to this new approach to admissions for this pilot program as it may form the basis for a longer-term initiative. Together with the Government of Nova Scotia, we are in discussions with various institutions about innovative ways to work together to provide greater healthcare access for rural Nova Scotians. This is the first step in a number of strategic health initiatives at Cape Breton University.”
     - David C. Dingwall, President and Vice-Chancellor, Cape Breton University

“We are thrilled to be entering into this strategic partnership with Cape Breton University and the Province of Nova Scotia. Dalhousie is committed to training physicians who address the primary care needs of our province and ensuring that our physician graduates reflect the diverse communities we serve.”
     - Dr. David Anderson, Dean, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University

Quick Facts:
-- Budget 2022-23 also committed $1.2 million to support additional seats at Dalhousie Medical School to help address the family physician shortage; it is the fourth year of increased funding to cover the cost of adding 16 additional seats in 2019

NOTE: Photos of the wildfire response near Horseshoe Lake, Yarmouth County, are available at: https://news.novascotia.ca/photos/2022/05/11/wildfire-near-horseshoe-lake-yarmouth-county
----------------------------------------------------------------
The wildfire near Horseshoe Lake, Yarmouth County, is now estimated to cover about 3,100 hectares. While the fire continues to spread and approach Rushy Lake, it is remote and not expected to reach homes or communities.

""Conditions are still adverse, so the fire may continue to spread. However, at this time, we do not see it reaching communities and the province’s response is being managed by highly trained professionals and fire crew members who are ready to respond at a moment's notice to keep us safe in case of emergency,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “As a former fire chief, I know they will protect our communities, homes and forests.”

Winds and low humidity are driving the spread of the fire. Smoke has prompted air quality alerts for the Yarmouth area. An incident command post is being established to co-ordinate on-scene management.

Conditions across the province are very dry. Burning is not permitted in Shelburne, Yarmouth or Queens counties today, May 11. Nova Scotians should check burn restrictions online or call the toll-free phone line at 1-855-564-2876 (BURN) before starting a fire.

Quick Facts:
-- fire crews have been fighting the wildfire since Monday, May 9
-- the current response includes two helicopters, 40 provincial fire crew members and one CL-415 water bomber from Newfoundland and Labrador
-- no homes or structures have been lost at this time and its not expected the fire will directly impact people
-- the cause of the fire is unknown
-- fire updates are posted on the Department’s Twitter feed

"Public Works","New Little Narrows Ferry Named for Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy","PUBLIC WORKS--New Little Narrows Ferry Named for Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy
----------------------------------------------------------------
The new ferry that crosses Little Narrows between Inverness County and Victoria County will be named the Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy to honour a steadfast, compassionate leader of the Mi'kmaw Nation.

The Department of Public Works held a contest involving the We’koqma’q Mi’kmaw School in Whycocomagh and the Rankin School of the Narrows in Iona to name the new Little Narrows ferry. The successful submission came from Grade 8 student August Francis at We’koqma’q Mi’kmaw School.

“A special thanks to the teachers, staff and students at both schools for participating in the ferry-naming contest,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “We had some great suggestions. However, Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy stood out. He was well respected and committed to serving his community and the Mi’kmaw people. A residential school survivor, Grand Chief Sylliboy promoted Mi’kmaw language, culture and spirituality and played an important role in advancing reconciliation. Above all else, he was a wise, humble and caring leader who treated everyone with kindness and respect.”

Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy of We’koqma’q First Nation died in 2017 at the age of 76. 

The new Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy ferry will begin crossing later this spring.

Quotes:
“My husband Ben was known to be kind, generous and humble. He used the ferry many times, whether for business to attend meetings or for pleasure to catch ball games or enjoy the scenic route. May the future crossings of the Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy honour his spirit, reconciliation and community service. We would like to personally thank August Francis of We’koqma’q Mi’kmaw School for his kind words and submission. We are extremely grateful, Paqsitpi Wela’liek. And a special thanks to Department of Public Works, Wela’liek.” 
     - Marie Sylliboy, wife of Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy

“Hearing the name of the new Little Narrows Ferry was a great honour for our people.  With all the different things that are happening to our people, good and bad, this is one of many steps to reconciliation. Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy was always there for everyone, and he is still going to be here helping people to get to where they are going.""  
     - John Bernard, Principal, We’koqma’q Mikmaw School

Quick Facts:
-- the Little Narrows ferry provides an important transportation link in central Cape Breton, serving many workers in the area and providing shorter routes for emergency vehicles
-- the Grand Chief Ben Sylliboy will replace the Caolas Silis (Gaelic for Julia’s Strait), a 32-year-old, 12-car cable ferry
-- the new 15-car cable ferry cost about $6 million, with the federal and provincial governments each funding about $3 million 
-- the new ferry will provide a reliable service for the next 40 years and have lower operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Province Ensures Funding Available for Long-Term Care Construction, Renovations","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Province Ensures Funding Available for Long-Term Care Construction, Renovations
----------------------------------------------------------
The Province is taking action to make sure funding is available to build or renovate 24 long-term care facilities across the province and build 500 rooms in Halifax Regional Municipality.

In the coming years, the government will borrow up to $1.8 billion to provide financing for these projects, which are part of 27 approved projects that will create or improve more than 2,800 beds. The three remaining projects already have funding in place.

“Making sure Nova Scotians have the peace of mind they deserve by being able to access long-term care when they need it will require one of the largest investments in this province’s history,” said Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams. “Putting this funding in place allows construction to proceed without delay.”

The 27 approved long-term care projects are at various stages of development and the first facilities will open in 2023.

Investing in long-term care facilities is another step in the Province’s plan to provide additional support to the continuing care sector. The construction and renovation projects generate billions of dollars of economic impact across the province. These investments will also create thousands of jobs in engineering, construction and healthcare.

"Environment and Climate Change","Regulatory Changes Reduce Burden on Small Farm Businesses","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Regulatory Changes Reduce Burden on Small Farm Businesses 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is introducing a simpler regulatory approach for processing facilities associated with small farm operations that will save them time and money while maintaining provincial environmental standards on wastewater. 

The change means that 11 activities will no longer require an industrial approval and will instead be regulated through standard wastewater approval requirements.

“These changes reduce red tape while ensuring that environmental standards are met,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “With input from industry, we are better aligning regulatory approvals to environmental and business needs.”

These activities include construction, operation or reclamation involving:
-- poultry, red meat, inland fish, dairy or dairy products, vegetable, or fruit processing plants
-- distilleries or wineries
-- breweries that produce 150,000 litres or more of alcoholic beverages per year
-- fish meal plants
-- food additive or supplement manufacturing plants

The changes take effect today, May 11, and align with the work of the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness. 

Quotes:
“The changes being announced today should help reduce some of the regulatory burdens our farms face. Anything that can be done to lessen the burden on our producers, while still ensuring the production of safe and sustainable food, is welcome. We anticipate that these changes will have a positive impact on producers.”
     - Tim Marsh, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture

“Regulatory modernization balances regulatory changes with the associated risks. This change is an example of how we can reduce red tape for smaller agricultural businesses, saving them time and money, while maintaining important oversight.”
     - Fred Crooks, Chief Regulatory Officer, Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness

Quick Facts: 
-- the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness estimates these changes will save each business $308 annually
-- the chief regulatory officer of the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness helps government identify and remove regulatory burdens for businesses and citizens
-- Nova Scotia’s approach to this work is consistent with other Canadian provinces

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Nova Scotia Welcomes Forest Fire Aid from Newfoundland and Labrador","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Nova Scotia Welcomes Forest Fire Aid from Newfoundland and Labrador
------------------------------------------------------------
A CL-415 water bomber is on its way from Newfoundland and Labrador to help Nova Scotia’s ground and air crews fight an out-of-control wildfire near Horseshoe Lake, Yarmouth County.

The fire is estimated to cover about 350 hectares and continues to grow. Winds and low humidity are factors in the spread of the fire. Smoke has prompted air quality alerts for the Yarmouth area.

Assistance was requested through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Nova Scotia is a member of a mutual aid and resource-sharing agreement which ensures all provinces and territories will receive help fighting forest fires when needed.

Conditions across the province are very dry, and burning is not permitted in Shelburne, Yarmouth or Queens counties today, May 10. Nova Scotians should check burn restrictions online or call the toll-free phone line at 1-855-564-2876 (BURN) before starting a fire.

April and May tend to be the busiest months of the fire season. Grass, brush and leaves dry very fast and make fuel for forest fires. Coupled with low humidity and high winds, fires can spread quickly, and they can be difficult to get under control.

Quick Facts:
-- fire crews have been fighting the wildfire since Monday, May 9
-- the current response includes two helicopters and 12 provincial fire crew members from Shelburne and Yarmouth counties
-- fire updates are posted on the Department’s Twitter feed

"Lieutenant-Governor / Health and Wellness","23 Paramedics Recognized for Exemplary Service","LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR/HEALTH/WELLNESS--23 Paramedics Recognized for Exemplary Service
-------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The list of paramedics who were awarded medals follows this release.
--------------------------------------------------------
Twenty-three Nova Scotia paramedics have been awarded the Emergency Medical Services Exemplary Service Medal, a national honour in recognition of their longtime dedication to the health, safety and well-being of Nova Scotians.

The paramedics honoured today, May 10, have dedicated their careers to providing care to people in their time of greatest need, sometimes at their own personal risk.

“During the pandemic, emergency medical services have been crucial to the province. I have no doubt the past two years tested the endurance of many,” said Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc, who presented the medals at a ceremony in Halifax. “It has been inspiring to witness countless examples of care and compassion during times of uncertainty. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the men and women who provide pre-hospital emergency care to Nova Scotians.”

Emergency Medical Services professionals can be nominated for the medal by their peers or the public. Recipients must have demonstrated exemplary service in their careers for at least 20 years, including 10 years in an emergency medical services position that involves risk.

Quotes:
“Being a paramedic is about looking someone in the eye who is having a really bad day and letting them know that I’m here for them. In my 25 years as a paramedic, I have seen an enormous shift as the profession has evolved and its scope of practice increased, with much of this change informed by evidence. However, while paramedicine is driven by data and informed practice, there has been one constant I have observed over the last 25 years, and that is a paramedic’s ability to genuinely care about another person in the most austere of environments and under the most unpredictable of circumstances.”
     - Sean Teed, medal recipient in Halifax Regional Municipality

Quick Facts:
-- Queen Elizabeth II created the Exemplary Service Medal in 1994
-- it is part of a national recognition program for people who work in high-risk jobs that enhance Canada's public safety
-- police, firefighters, corrections officers, coast guard members and peace officers are also eligible for exemplary service medals 
-- the medal is part of the Canadian honours system

"Premier's Office","Province Marks 30th Anniversary of Westray Mine Disaster","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Province Marks 30th Anniversary of Westray Mine Disaster
--------------------------------------------------------
Three decades have passed since an explosion at a mine in Plymouth, Pictou County, killed 26 workers. Today, May 9, Nova Scotians will gather to mark the 30th anniversary of the Westray disaster.

“Nova Scotians will never forget that day when those hard-working men didn’t return home to their families,” said Karla MacFarlane, MLA for Pictou West and Minister of Community Services, on behalf of Premier Tim Houston. “The families continue to carry the trauma of that day, and the community shares their grief on the loss of their loved ones in a preventable tragedy.”

On the morning of May 9, 1992, a massive explosion, caused by a buildup of methane gas and excessive coal dust, erupted through the Westray coal mine. Despite an intense and heroic search and rescue effort that continued for six days after the explosion, there were no survivors and only 15 of the 26 bodies were recovered.

A public inquiry found that the explosion was preventable, and the inquiry’s recommendations resulted in significant changes to workplace health and safety.

Nova Scotians will gather in the New Glasgow area to mark the 30th anniversary of the explosion, including an assembly at Westray Miners Memorial Park. Organizers include relatives of the deceased workers, the United Steelworkers Union, Nova Scotia Federation of Labour, WCB (Workers’ Compensation Board) Nova Scotia and the Province of Nova Scotia.

Quotes:
“Even though some occupations carry more risk than others, one thing is true no matter what job you do: all Nova Scotians deserve to return home to their families at the end of the workday. We must do everything we can, every day, to prevent workplace fatalities and injuries. In this way, we can make sure those who lost their lives are never forgotten.”
     - Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration

“I will never forget the day the call came in to us at the WCB about the Westray Mine explosion. The 26 men lost forever, the lasting heartbreak, the deeply preventable failure of safety – we must remember it, always. Tragedies like Westray, and too many others, must be the reason we do all we can to ensure workers and employers across the province don’t just know the rules when it comes to safety, but truly care about why they matter so much.
     - Stuart MacLean, CEO, WCB Nova Scotia

“On May 9, we will recognize the sacrifice made by the 26 miners who were killed at the Westray Mine explosion in 1992. We will stand in solidarity with families and former co-workers to honour the memory of the 26 Westray miners. They are victims for whom the law failed; they paid the ultimate price of going to work. That’s why we will continue to fight for better laws and safety regulations. By working together, we can make change, change to ensure every worker comes home to their family at day’s end. No job is worth dying for.”
     - Danny Cavanagh, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Labour

Quick Facts:
-- the Westray explosion is one of the deadliest mining disasters in Canadian history
-- the Province established a Commission of Inquiry to review the Westray tragedy shortly after it happened
-- the report of the Westray Mine Public Inquiry was titled The Westray Story: A Predictable Path to Disaster and included 74 recommendations to improve health and safety in the mining industry
-- the majority of the recommendations were addressed with the implementation of the Underground Mining Regulations in 2003

“Many of these centres serve as a lifeline to youth in the province,” said Minister Comer. “These centres and the programs they offer help youth overcome challenges, which we know have been compounded by the social and economic impacts of the pandemic. It’s important that we, as a government, be there to support this great work and the youth who benefit from it, especially in a time when fundraising has been challenging.”

The centres are receiving a one-time investment to support programming for at-risk youth, including youth experiencing homelessness.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------
Les données contenues dans le sommaire épidémiologique sur la COVID-19 cette semaine démontrent une réduction continue du nombre de cas confirmés par un test en laboratoire en Nouvelle-Écosse depuis le pic de la sixième vague au début avril. Les données indiquent une stabilisation des nouveaux cas dans les établissements de soins de longue durée et les complications graves, mais le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès demeure élevé comparativement aux vagues précédentes.  

« Il est encourageant de voir le nombre de cas confirmés par un test PCR diminuer encore une fois cette semaine et de constater que le pic de la sixième vague est derrière nous, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Toutefois, le nombre de cas est toujours élevé. La COVID-19 est toujours présente, en plus de certains autres virus respiratoires comme l'influenza. Il est donc encore plus important d'utiliser les stratégies que nous avons apprises ensemble au cours des deux dernières années : portez votre masque, gardez vos distances, lavez-vous les mains et surtout, restez à la maison si vous êtes malade, qu'il s'agisse de la COVID-19 ou d'autre chose. » 

Une deuxième dose de rappel est offerte depuis avril aux personnes de 70 ans ou plus et aux résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée et des établissements de soins pour bénéficiaires internes, selon les recommandations du Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation. Jusqu'à présent, plus de 29 000 personnes ont reçu une deuxième dose de rappel. 

Les personnes âgées de 70 ou plus qui vivent dans la communauté peuvent maintenant prendre rendez-vous en ligne ou par téléphone pour recevoir le vaccin dans une pharmacie. Les membres des Premières Nations âgés de 55 ans ou plus peuvent maintenant recevoir une deuxième dose de rappel à une clinique communautaire. Les établissements de soins de longue durée et les établissements de soins pour bénéficiaires internes ont commencé à offrir le vaccin à tous les résidents. On recommande les vaccins de Pfizer et de Moderna pour les doses de rappel. Les personnes qui ne peuvent pas recevoir un vaccin à base d'ARNm pour des raisons médicales peuvent recevoir le vaccin de Novavax comme dose de rappel. 

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés.

Pour la période de sept jours se terminant le 2 mai :
-- 3 415 nouveaux cas confirmés par un test PCR
-- 77 nouvelles hospitalisations en raison de la COVID-19
-- 22 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique

Depuis le début de la cinquième vague (le 8 décembre 2021) :
-- L'âge médian des personnes dont le cas de COVID-19 a été confirmé par un test PCR est de 42 ans.
-- L'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées est de 71 ans.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées est de 81 ans.
-- Le risque d'hospitalisation est 10 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de 18 à 49 ans, et le risque de décès est 95 fois plus élevé chez les personnes de 70 ans ou plus comparativement aux personnes de moins de 50 ans. 

Au 5 mai, 65 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel.

Le rapport est affiché dans le site Web du gouvernement sur le coronavirus : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#epidemiologic-summaries (rapport en anglais seulement).

Le tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 sera mis à jour chaque semaine jusqu'à la fin mai.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report
--------------------------------------------------------
This week’s COVID-19 epidemiologic summary shows a continued decrease in lab-confirmed cases in Nova Scotia since the peak of the sixth wave in early April. The data points to a stabilization in new long-term care cases and severe outcomes, although the number of hospitalizations and deaths remains high compared to previous waves.

“It is encouraging to see the number of new PCR-confirmed infections decline again this week and to see the peak of the sixth wave behind us,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “That said, our numbers are still high. COVID-19 is still with us, along with a number of other respiratory viruses, including influenza. This makes it more important than ever to use the tools we’ve learned together these last two years – wear your mask, keep your distance, wash your hands and, most importantly, stay home when you’re sick, COVID-19 or otherwise.”

The rollout of second booster doses began in April for adults 70 and older and residents of long-term and residential care facilities, as recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. To date, more than 29,000 people have received a second booster dose.

Seniors 70 years and older living in the community can book online or by phone to get their vaccine at their local pharmacy. Members of First Nations communities 55 and older can now access a second booster dose through community clinics, and long-term and residential care facilities have started to provide vaccines to all residents. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended for use as boosters. People who cannot receive mRNA vaccine for medical reasons can book Novavax as a booster.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations.

For the seven-day period ending May 2, there were:
-- 3,415 new PCR-confirmed cases
-- 77 new hospitalizations due to COVID-19
-- 22 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system.

Since the start of the fifth wave (December 8, 2021):
-- the median age of PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 42
-- the median age of hospitalizations is 71
-- the median age of reported deaths is 81
-- the risk of hospitalization is 10 times higher for those aged 70 years and older compared to those age 18 to 49 and the risk of death is 95 times higher for those aged 70 years and older compared to those younger than 50. 

As of May 5, 65 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose.

The report is posted on the government’s coronavirus website at:  https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

The public dashboard will continue to be updated weekly until the end of May.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The government will not be moving forward with the non-resident property tax. Premier Tim Houston announced the change today, May 5.

“My intentions all along were to improve home affordability, not to be at odds with our core value of being a welcoming province,” said Premier Houston. “I have heard for months from Nova Scotians who are concerned about housing affordability and want to be able to buy their first home. I commit to finding a tool to make it more affordable for first-time homebuyers.”

The non-resident property tax will be removed completely for all non-residents who own residential property in Nova Scotia. The non-resident deed transfer tax will proceed as planned. Both measures were introduced in the spring budget.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Prevent Bear Encounters This Spring","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Prevent Bear Encounters This Spring
---------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians can take simple steps to avoid attracting bears and other wildlife into their backyards this spring.

Bears have a keen sense of smell and will wander into populated areas if there is easy access to food from people’s activities. Once accustomed to food from humans, bears may return to a property repeatedly. This poses a safety risk and increases potential for human-bear conflict.

“Bears are smart and adaptable animals that will search out easily accessible food sources, even in populated areas. Wild animals should rely on natural diets, which are healthiest,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “Human interactions with bears can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous. However, we can coexist with wildlife through proper management of food, waste and other attractants.”

The Department aims to prevent conflict situations by encouraging Nova Scotians to take steps to identify and remove food sources that attract wildlife to homes and cottages:
-- regularly clean green bins and garbage containers with warm, soapy water to reduce odours
-- store garbage and green bins inside until the morning of collection
-- freeze meat, fish and other foods with strong smells and put them in the bin on collection day
-- burn off barbecues and grills at high temperatures after every use and clean them often
-- keep pet food indoors
-- turn garden compost piles often and add lime to reduce odour
-- take down bird feeders and never put out bread, table scraps or other food for birds
-- pick fruit from trees and berries as soon as they ripen and clean up food from the ground.

People who see bears near homes or communities should report the sighting to their local Department of Natural Resources and Renewables office or by calling 1-800-565-2224 after regular business hours. People should also get in touch if they are concerned about wildlife damaging property or threatening their safety, or if they see an injured or diseased animal.

Quotes:
“Eliminating bear attractants on your property is the most effective way of reducing the chance of conflict. Being proactive is an important part of coexistence and animal health and welfare. Work with your neighbours, municipality and local Department of Natural Resources and Renewables office to find solutions to minimize wildlife attractants. We want to work with homeowners to address conflict situations before they become problems so we can reduce the number of encounters and keep people and bears safe. We all have a role to play promoting coexistence with wildlife by addressing activities like feeding that put animals at risk.”
     - Tricia Fleming, Human-Wildlife Conflict Biologist, Department of Natural Resources and Renewables

Quick Facts:
-- Department of Natural Resources and Renewables wildlife biologists and technicians responded to 983 bear incidents in 2021
-- black bear (Ursus americanus) is the only bear species in Nova Scotia
-- regulations to address situations where people or wildlife are at high risk because of feeding will soon be created

"Premier's Office / Finance and Treasury Board","Non-resident Property Tax to be Updated in Regulations","PREMIER’S OFFICE/FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD--Non-resident Property Tax to be Updated in Regulations
-------------------------------------------------------
Updates to Nova Scotia’s new non-resident property tax that will help military families and provide relief for owners of small cottages will be part of regulations to be released this spring. The changes will also clarify the tax for vacant residential land owned by non-residents.

Premier Tim Houston announced the changes today, May 3, during the State of the Province address.

“We love our seasonal residents, and we will continue to show them our Nova Scotian hospitality and welcome them with open arms, but my main concern is for the people who are or want to live here year-round but can’t afford a place to live,” said Premier Houston. “We are positioned to grow in every region, but we need housing. This is one way our government is addressing the housing crisis and these changes respond to concerns we have heard from Nova Scotians.”

Active members of the Canadian Armed Forces will be exempt from paying the non-resident property tax, introduced in the spring budget. The rates will vary for other non-residents according to the value of the property assessment, benefitting owners of smaller properties like small cottages:
-- they will be exempt from the tax on the first $150,000 of the assessment
-- the tax will be 0.5 per cent on the value between $150,000 and $250,000
-- the tax will be two per cent on the value above $250,000.

All vacant residential land owned by non-residents will be taxed at two per cent regardless of the assessed value.
 
The government intends to spend more to address the housing crisis than will be received in revenue from the non-resident property tax. The deed transfer tax, also part of the spring budget, will proceed without changes. 

Quote:
“We are listening to the feedback we have received and believe that these changes reflect some of the concerns raised by non-resident property owners. We expect regulations to be finalized this spring.”
     - Allan MacMaster, Minister of Finance and Treasury Board

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","Amendments to First Aid Requirements","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Amendments to First Aid Requirements 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is updating workplace first aid requirements, fulfilling a commitment to harmonize its rules with other jurisdictions in Canada. 

“When an accident or illness happens in the workplace, it’s critically important to have first aid ready until professional help can be provided,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “Having consistent approaches across jurisdictions can help save people’s lives. It can also save businesses money and time and allow for greater mobility of workers across Canada.""

Under the National Occupational Health and Safety Reconciliation Agreement, Nova Scotia committed to harmonizing its training requirements and workplace first aid kit requirements based on a new Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standard. The amendments help to modernize first aid requirements and consolidate them in Nova Scotia under the Workplace Health and Safety Regulations.

The regulations are part of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and apply to all employers in Nova Scotia. 

The Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration will be helping workplaces prepare and understand the changes and ensuring the contents and terminology used in first aid kits are consistent. It will also make first aid training certificates transferable throughout Canada and clarify minimum requirements for workplace first aid training. 

The Department hosted two public consultations and offered an online survey to help inform the changes.

It is also making minor administrative amendments to the Occupational Diving Regulations and Underground Mining Regulations to ensure consistency with the revised workplace first aid requirements. 

Quotes:
“For businesses working in more than one jurisdiction, the cost of complying with several variations of first aid kits and training requirements adds up quickly. Harmonizing first aid requirements between jurisdictions cuts unnecessary red tape and greatly improves our regulatory environment for businesses working across provincial lines.” 
     - Fred Crooks, Chief Regulatory Officer, Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness

Quick Facts:
-- changes come into effect on June 13
-- first aid training certificates issued before regulatory changes take effect will be valid until they expire; first aid kits that meet the current requirements are in compliance until June 13, 2023
-- these changes will reduce the overall cost for employees and businesses by about $1.5 million annually
-- Nova Scotia’s chief regulatory officer sits on Canada’s Regulatory Reconciliation and Co-operation Table, a federal-provincial-territorial body established under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement to oversee the regulatory reconciliation process and promote regulatory co-operation across Canada
-- reconciliation agreements endorsed by the co-operation table in 2018 and 2020 align provincial requirements for first aid training and first aid kits

—---------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia Ombudsman William A. Smith will retire effective June 30, Premier Tim Houston announced today, May 3. 

“Mr. Smith planned to retire earlier but agreed to stay on to support the office through the pandemic. I thank Mr. Smith for his many years of service to the people of Nova Scotia and to Canada and wish him well in his retirement. A search for his successor will begin in the near future,” said Premier Houston.

Mr. Smith, who has been Nova Scotia’s Ombudsman since 2016, has overseen the administration and investigation of more than 12,000 files during his six-year tenure.

In the past year, the office completed a major review of Island Employment in Cape Breton, with all recommendations accepted and implemented, and saw long-standing recommendations regarding a child death review structure implemented. Requirements for reviews of deaths of children in provincial care or custody were enshrined in law and regulation in 2021.

Mr. Smith successfully reinforced the independence and authority of the office by pursuing a critical 2019 decision from the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal which upheld the ombudsman’s right to review certain files initially withheld by a government department.

The Office of the Ombudsman celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 2021.

Quotes:
“I am grateful for the confidence in me expressed by three Nova Scotia premiers and their governments. Our work involves investigating complaints that focus on administrative fairness, transparency and good governance. It is essential that public servants support our work and our responsibilities to investigate and report. That support starts at the top.”

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","New Voluntary Trade Program to Provide More Inclusive Hair Care","NOVA SCOTIA APPRENTICESHIP AGENCY--New Voluntary Trade Program to Provide More Inclusive Hair Care
-------------------------------------------------------
People who want to learn how to perform natural hair care services or have their skills recognized can soon become certified practitioners in Nova Scotia.

The Black Beauty Culture Hair Innovator is now a voluntary trade under the Apprenticeship and Trades Qualifications Act. The Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency will offer apprenticeship technical training starting later this year.

“Hair care is an important part of culture in many communities, including people of African descent. I am grateful communities took the time to participate in consultation and engagement sessions to share why they believe a voluntary trade program for natural hair care service providers is important,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “With the designation of Black Beauty Culture Hair Innovator as a trade, existing practitioners and those new to the occupation will have access to a training program and will be able to have their skills formally recognized through trade certification.”

Natural hair care practitioners consult on, design and perform natural hair care services typically associated with, but not limited to, people of African descent.

Practitioners analyze the client’s hair and scalp; style, such as with braids, locs and twists; and incorporate extensions, weaves, hairpieces and wigs. Services may also include incidental cutting, straightening, curling and hair drying. Natural hair care services do not include the use of chemicals.

The apprenticeship board approved an application for establishing a new voluntary trade after it followed its standard process of establishing a trade advisory committee to develop the scope of the occupation. Consultation sessions were held with African Nova Scotian communities and organizations and industry professionals to determine the level of support for this trade.

The Black Beauty Culture Hair Innovator trade addresses a need for training in the delivery of natural hair care services. As a voluntary trade, people may choose to participate in the program and receive certification, but certification by the agency or any other regulatory body is not required for individuals to provide natural hair care services in Nova Scotia.

Quotes:
“The designation of Black Beauty Culture Hair Innovator (natural hair care practitioner) is a greater accomplishment than I could ever imagine or have done on my own. My late father, Samuel Dixon Sr., represents the fortitude, determination and adaptability that strengthened me throughout this journey. It is time for Black Nova Scotians and all those who will be trained and receive these hair care services to be recognized and cared for. In the spirit of the Viola Desmond Studio of Beauty Culture in the 1940s, individuals seeking to have their hair styled using natural hair care practices will have greater access to this type of styling in their own communities.”
     - Samantha Dixon-Slawter, trade applicant and co-founder, Black Beauty Culture Association

“The apprenticeship board is very pleased to designate Black Beauty Culture Hair Innovator as a voluntary trade in Nova Scotia. Community engagement was an essential part of the application process to ensure that those currently delivering and receiving these services had their voices heard. We heard that specialized training and access to specialized hair care services is important to individuals and communities who will require these services, and it’s also important for cultural practices and styles.”
     - Brad Smith, Chair, Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency

“Hair is significant to the cultural and personal identity for people of African descent. It is important for natural hair practitioners to not only understand the various types of textures, treatments and styles, but the history, sensitivity and symbolism linked to people of African decent. This voluntary trade program recognizes the cultural identity of our community.”
     - Dwayne Provo, Associate Deputy Minister, African Nova Scotian Affairs

Quick Facts:
-- the minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration is responsible for the Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency, a special operating agency designated under the Public Service Act
-- the board designated the trade on April 14 following an application by the Black Beauty Culture Association in 2019

"African Nova Scotian Affairs / Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","New Exhibit to Explore African Nova Scotians’ Connection to the Sea","COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE/AFRICAN NOVA SCOTIAN AFFAIRS--New Exhibit to Explore African Nova Scotians’ Connection to the Sea
------------------------------------------------------------
From fishers to shipbuilders and sailors to shippers, the stories and contributions of African Nova Scotians in marine industries will be featured in a new, collaborative museum exhibit.

The African Nova Scotian Seafaring Project is a collaboration between the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre and the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia. The government is investing $150,000 in the project, scheduled to launch next spring.

“People of African descent have contributed greatly to every aspect of Nova Scotia’s society, including in marine industries,” said Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Steve Craig, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage and African Nova Scotian Affairs. “This project is another opportunity to further learn about African Nova Scotian history going back more than 400 years.”

The African Nova Scotian Seafaring Project is in the early stages of planning and will require input from a community working group. It will officially launch in May 2023 at the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre in Shelburne County and travel to locations across the province before arriving at the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic in Lunenburg, where it will remain long-term.

The total cost of the project is estimated at $200,000.

Quotes:

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Province Making Progress on Implementing New Forest Practices Guide","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Province Making Progress on Implementing New Forest Practices Guide
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is close to fully implementing the new forest practices guide as part of its work to ensure a sustainable forestry industry in Nova Scotia.

The Silvicultural Guide for the Ecological Matrix applies to Acadian forest on Crown land and is being phased in gradually. By June 1, the majority of practices in the guide will be required.

“We are moving ahead with a fundamental shift in how forestry is done in this province, placing a higher priority on biodiversity and protecting healthy ecosystems within our provincial forests,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “We’re supporting that shift through broad-based training for our staff and forestry operators and projects that help private woodlot owners explore how they can adopt ecological forestry.”

The guide outlines the types of forest practices that can be used within matrix – also known as mixed forest – areas on Crown lands. In these areas, the triad model of ecological forestry prioritizes biodiversity conservation through lower impact forestry and reduces clearcutting.

As of February 1, the Department has required that new harvest plan proposals follow most of the practices in the new guide. The requirement also applies to proposals that were submitted before February 1 but not approved by that date. These harvest proposals now reflect the latest requirements when they are posted on the Harvest Plan Map Viewer for public consultation.

Effective June 1, the requirement to follow practices in the new guide will be extended to most harvest plans that had been approved using previous guidelines. In the few cases where meeting that time frame is not possible, licensees must work with the Department to transition their harvest plans as quickly as possible.

Some harvest plans that were approved under old guidelines will be grandfathered. Licensees can continue following the original approval until completed if, as of June 1:
-- they are actively harvesting a block
-- they are not actively harvesting, but the block has 10 hectares or less remaining to be harvested.

Next steps toward full implementation of the new guide include more training for people in the forestry industry as well as developing a software solution to translate proposal data into final harvest plans (prescriptions) that follow all practices in the guide.

Work is also underway to define how and where high production forestry can take place on Crown lands. This will be the smallest of the three ecological forestry zones.

Quotes:
“The harvests in the ecological matrix are not meant to be strictly for fibre but more designed to create an uneven-aged stand to promote biodiversity, maintain or increase wildlife habitat and more closely resemble what happens in unmanaged forests. I enjoyed working with this new prescription because it shows the importance of what we are leaving behind when we are done.”
     - Jamie Caddick, Owner, Jamie Caddick Logging Limited

“The ecological forestry training sessions are informative and a good balance between infield and in class time covering operational best practices, better understanding of the new prescriptions, the importance of biodiversity and supporting ecosystems throughout the forests.”
     - Carl Tingley, trainer and Owner of Forest Liaison Inc.

Quick Facts:
-- all staff who review and approve harvest plans have been trained on how to implement the Silvicultural Guide for the Ecological Matrix
-- about 50 people in the forestry industry have also been trained and about 150 more will be trained by September
-- adopting ecological forestry was a recommendation in the independent review of forestry practices in Nova Scotia by Prof. Bill Lahey
-- the triad model of ecological forestry being adopted on Crown land consists of three legs: conservation zones, high-production forestry zones and mixed use or matrix zones
-- the three zones work together to allow ecological and economic goals to coexist, leading to healthy forests and a sustainable forestry sector

"Health and Wellness","Temporary Dialysis Unit at Cumberland Regional Health Care Centre","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Temporary Dialysis Unit at Cumberland Regional Health Care Centre
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians who receive life-saving dialysis treatment in New Brunswick will soon be able to receive care closer to home. 

The Province has allocated $900,000 to establish a temporary, six-station dialysis unit at Cumberland Regional Health Care Centre in Amherst by this summer. 

“Nova Scotians deserve to access care as close to home as possible,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “The temporary unit will improve access to care for dialysis patients in their community, while we explore a permanent solution.” 

Eleven Nova Scotians currently travel to Moncton multiple times each week to receive dialysis treatment. Due to staffing challenges at the clinic in Moncton, continued treatment for out-of-province patients is no longer guaranteed.

The temporary dialysis unit can support up to 16 patients when it opens, with capacity increasing to 24 patients after the first year. 

The unit will remain in place until the Cumberland Regional Health Care Centre redevelopment project is complete. Plans to improve the facility were announced in 2020 and include a new 12-station dialysis unit, which will be in addition to the three dialysis units currently operating in Northern Zone.

Quick Facts: 
-- there are currently three dialysis units in Northern Zone, at Colchester East Hants Health Centre in Truro, All Saints Springhill Hospital and Sutherland Harris Memorial Hospital in Pictou

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19, sixième vague","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19, sixième vague 
--------------------------------------------------------
Les données contenues dans le sommaire épidémiologique sur la COVID-19 cette semaine démontrent une réduction marquée du nombre de nouveaux cas comparativement à la période précédente de sept jours. Toutefois, le nombre d'hospitalisations en Nouvelle-Écosse a augmenté depuis le dernier rapport, et on signale 24 nouveaux décès liés à la COVID-19.

« Les données sur les infections confirmées par un test PCR cette semaine suggèrent que le pic de la sixième vague est enfin derrière nous, affirme la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Bien que l'augmentation du nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès ne soit pas imprévue, ces données ne sont pas négligeables non plus. Chacune de ces 24 personnes décédées de la COVID-19 a une famille qui est en deuil après cette perte inestimable. Ce sont ces familles et ces proches qu'il ne faut pas oublier. C'est pourquoi nous nous faisons vacciner. C'est pourquoi nous portons un masque. C'est pourquoi nous restons à la maison lorsque nous sommes malades. » 

La Santé publique a commencé à signaler les données sur la sixième vague cette semaine. La cinquième vague inclut maintenant les données du 8 décembre 2021 au 28 février 2022. La sixième vague a débuté le 1er mars 2022. Certaines données sont toujours présentées du 8 décembre 2021, y compris le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès par groupe d'âge. 

Les groupes d'âge ont été mis à jour dans le sommaire épidémiologique pour mieux correspondre aux données sur la vaccination. Le nombre d'hospitalisations est maintenant signalé selon quatre groupes, soit les personnes de moins de 18 ans, les personnes de 18 à 49 ans, les personnes de 50 à 69 ans et les personnes de 70 ans ou plus. Les décès sont signalés selon trois groupes, soit les personnes de moins de 50 ans, les personnes de 50 à 69 ans et les personnes de 70 ans ou plus. 

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés.

Pour la période de sept jours se terminant le 25 avril :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 5 436 ont donné un résultat positif.
-- Quatre-vingt-onze nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19. 
-- Durant cette période, 24 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.

Depuis le début de la cinquième vague (le 8 décembre 2021) : 
-- L'âge médian des personnes dont le cas de COVID-19 a été confirmé par un test PCR est de 42 ans.
-- L'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées est de 71 ans.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées est de 80 ans.
-- Plus de 53 % des hospitalisations et 80 % des décès signalés sont des personnes de 70 ans ou plus.

Au 27 avril, 64,7 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu au moins une dose de rappel.

Le rapport est affiché dans le site Web du gouvernement sur le coronavirus : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#epidemiologic-summaries (rapport en anglais seulement).

Le tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 sera mis à jour chaque semaine jusqu'à la fin mai.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report, Sixth Wave","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report, Sixth Wave 
--------------------------------------------------------
The data in this week’s COVID-19 epidemiologic summary shows a marked decrease in new cases compared to the previous seven-day period. However, hospital admissions in Nova Scotia have increased since the last report and there are 24 new deaths due to COVID-19.

“The data this week on PCR-confirmed infections suggest the peak of the sixth wave is behind us,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “While the increase in hospitalizations and deaths is not unexpected, they are not insignificant, either. Behind each of these 24 COVID-19 deaths is a family grieving an incalculable loss. It is those families and those loved ones that we should keep in mind. That’s why we get vaccinated. That’s why we wear a mask. That’s why we stay home when we’re sick.”

Public health began reporting on the sixth wave this week. The fifth wave now includes data from December 8, 2021, to February 28, 2022. The sixth wave begins March 1, 2022. Some data are still presented from December 8, 2021, to present, including hospitalization and death rates by age group.

Age groups have been updated in the epidemiologic summary to better align with vaccine rollout. Hospitalizations are now reported in four groups – under 18, 18 to 49, 50 to 69, and 70 and over. Deaths are reported in three groups – under 50, 50 to 69 and 70 and over.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations.

For the seven-day period ending April 25:
-- there were 5,436 new PCR-confirmed cases
-- there were 91 new hospitalizations due to COVID-19
-- there were 24 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system.

Since the start of the fifth wave (December 8, 2021):
-- the median age of PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 42
-- the median age of hospitalizations is 71
-- the median age of reported deaths is 80
-- more than 53 per cent of hospitalizations and 80 per cent of reported deaths are in adults 70 years of age and older.

As of April 27, 64.7 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received at least one booster dose.

The report is posted on government’s coronavirus website at:  https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

The public dashboard will continue to be updated weekly until the end of May.

----------------------------------------------------------------
L'accès aux dossiers d'adoption en Nouvelle-Écosse sera modifié le 1er mai, permettant aux personnes adoptées, lorsqu'elles auront 19 ans, et aux parents biologiques d'accéder aux renseignements s'ils le souhaitent.

Une fois les changements en vigueur, les gens peuvent présenter une demande au Programme de divulgation de la province pour recevoir leurs renseignements en vertu de la loi sur les dossiers d'adoption (Adoption Records Act). Les gens peuvent toujours protéger leurs renseignements personnels en présentant un veto à la divulgation ou un avis sur la prise de contact si leur dossier n'a pas encore été divulgué.

« Bien que l'ouverture des dossiers d'adoption soit accueillie favorablement par bon nombre de personnes, certaines gens préfèrent maintenir leur confidentialité, affirme Karla MacFarlane, ministre des Services communautaires. Les vetos à la divulgation et les avis sur la prise de contact seront toujours acceptés après le 1er mai, si les renseignements n'ont pas déjà été divulgués. »

Un veto à la divulgation est un document qui empêche la divulgation de renseignements qui permettraient d'identifier une personne adoptée ou un parent biologique. Un avis sur la prise de contact permet à une personne de divulguer ses renseignements identificatoires en précisant sa préférence sur la façon dont on peut communiquer avec elle ou qu'elle ne souhaite pas qu'on communique avec elle.

Les gens qui souhaitent présenter une demande pour obtenir leurs renseignements pourront le faire en ligne dès le 1er mai. Le site Web offrira également une version imprimable du formulaire que les gens pourront télécharger, remplir et envoyer par courriel ou par la poste.

« Avec la participation et l'appui des défenseurs des droits des personnes touchées par l'adoption et des intervenants et familles concernées, nous accueillons avec joie et avec un optimisme prudent la modernisation de la divulgation des dossiers d'adoption, qui offrira une meilleure compréhension de leurs antécédents aux nombreuses personnes de la province qui sont à la recherche de tels renseignements. Nous remercions toutes les personnes qui ont joué un rôle dans ce processus. Le 1er mai sera une journée remplie de toutes sortes d'émotions pour de nombreuses personnes, et nous voulons rassurer les gens qui sont touchés par l'adoption que nous allons continuer de défendre leurs droits. »

"Community Services","Changes to Adoption Records Take Effect May 1","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Changes to Adoption Records Take Effect May 1 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Access to adoption records in Nova Scotia will change on May 1, allowing adopted people, once they turn 19, and birth parents to access their information if they choose.

Once the changes take effect, people can apply to the Province’s Disclosure Program and receive their information under the Adoption Records Act. Individuals can still protect their privacy by filing a disclosure veto or contact notice if the record has not already been released.

“While the opening of adoption records is welcomed by many, others wish to maintain their privacy,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “Disclosure vetoes and contact notices will continue to be accepted after May 1, depending on whether the information has already been shared.”

A disclosure veto is a document that prevents identifying information about an adopted person or birth parent being shared. With a contact notice, people share identifying information and state how they want to be contacted or that they don’t wish to be contacted.

People who wish to apply for their information may do so online starting on May 1. The website will also have printable versions of the form to download, fill out and send through email or regular mail.

Quotes:
“With the input and support from adoption advocates, past and present, and affected stakeholders and families, we are both excited and cautiously optimistic that modernizing adoption record disclosure will bring a deeper understanding to the many Nova Scotians who have been searching for the start of their story. We want to thank everyone who played a role in making this a reality. May 1 will be a day filled with a mix of emotions for many Nova Scotians and we want all those impacted by adoption to know that we will continue to advocate on their behalf.”
     - Monica Kennedy, Co-Founder, Nova Scotia Adoptee Advocacy Group

Quick Facts:
-- as of April 20, the Disclosure Program had received 295 privacy filings (235 disclosure vetoes and 60 contact notices)
-- under the new legislation, people who have previously indicated they want to keep their information private are still required to fill out a disclosure veto or contact notice

On the National Day of Mourning, today, April 28, Nova Scotians come together to remember those who have died or were injured because of a workplace accident or work-related illness.

“Please join us in taking a moment to reflect and remember those we have lost,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “We can honour these individuals by continuing to work towards safer and healthier workplaces and collectively renewing our commitment to workplace health and safety. All Nova Scotians deserve to come home safe from work.”

Minister Balser will join Stuart MacLean, CEO of the Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) Nova Scotia, Danny Cavanagh, President of the Federation of Labour, and other federation representatives at a ceremony at Province House in Halifax later this morning.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Westray mining disaster in Plymouth, Pictou County. On the morning of May 9, 1992, 26 families lost sons, fathers, brothers, and uncles in an explosion at the coal mine. One of the victims was Allen Martin's brother, Glenn. Their story is available here: http://dayofmourning.ns.ca/ .

“All of us at WCB Nova Scotia join with you in paying tribute to the lives lost, and the lives impacted forever, by workplace injury in our province. Each and every person we honour in words, thoughts, and actions, is someone who should be here today, but is not, because something went wrong at a workplace. Today we pay tribute, and we renew our commitment to work toward a safer tomorrow.”
     - Stuart MacLean, CEO, WCB Nova Scotia

“April 28 is a day to pause, reflect and renew our commitment to health and safety and prevention right across Nova Scotia. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to make sure all workers come home safely at the end of their day.”
     - Danny Cavanagh, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Labour

This project will enhance visitor experience and contribute positively to the preservation of Cape Breton’s coal mining legacy. Phase 2 of the renovations includes upgrades to the lobby, the Men of the Deeps theatre, the Lamphouse and the pre-tour area. 

The Government of Canada is also providing a non-repayable contribution of $800,000 through the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) towards the project.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Georges Bank Moratorium Extended to 2032","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Georges Bank Moratorium Extended to 2032
---------------------------------------------------------
The provincial and federal governments have extended the moratorium on oil and gas exploration and drilling on Georges Bank to December 31, 2032.

The Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation (Nova Scotia) Act and mirror federal legislation (collectively referred to as the Accord Acts) allow the federal and provincial ministers to jointly prohibit oil and gas activities in Georges Bank. The Accord Acts allow extensions of the moratorium in increments of up to 10 years. The moratorium was due to expire on December 31, 2022.

“Nova Scotians want resource development to be balanced with strong protections for the environment. As we work toward our clean energy goals, our governments are extending the Georges Bank moratorium to ensure offshore development strikes this important balance,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables.

Georges Bank is a large submarine bank at the edge of the Atlantic continental shelf between Cape Cod and Nova Scotia. It is a natural habitat for a wide range of fish, marine mammals and corals. As one of the world’s most productive fishing grounds, Georges Bank also supports important commercial fisheries.

Quotes:
“By extending this moratorium on offshore oil and gas activities in Georges Bank, we are maintaining a unique and valuable ecosystem for current and future generations. This decision is in keeping with the shared goals of both the federal and provincial governments to protect our oceans and our economy while continuing to work toward a clean energy future.”
     - Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources Canada

“Georges Bank is a vital area to Nova Scotia’s fishery that is economically important for both the harvesting and processing sectors. Many Nova Scotians and their families rely on it for their living. It’s a special marine ecosystem that has been historically linked to Nova Scotians’ way of life for generations and can continue to contribute to the prosperity of our people well into the future.”
     - Steve Craig, Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture

“To provide the data needed to inform this decision, our team recently commissioned a science and socio-economic report on Georges Bank. This work involved careful evaluation of credible and objective fisheries and scientific information and the creation of a detailed report. This report provided the federal and provincial governments with the data needed to support evidence-based decision-making related to the Georges Bank moratorium.”
     - Alisdair McLean, Executive Director, Net Zero Atlantic

Quick Facts:
-- a legislated environmental and socio-economic impact study was done before deciding on the extension of the moratorium
-- under the Accord Acts, extending the moratorium must be a joint decision of the ministers of Natural Resources Canada and Natural Resources and Renewables

-----------------------------------------------------------------
La Semaine de l’éducation 2022 est une très bonne occasion pour le milieu de l’éducation de rendre hommage à des enseignants, des administrateurs, des éducateurs de la petite enfance, des membres du personnel de soutien des écoles et des partenaires du système éducatif pour leur travail remarquable.

Soixante-neuf personnes d’un peu partout en Nouvelle-Écosse ont reçu un prix lors d’une cérémonie qui a eu lieu aujourd’hui 25 avril à Dartmouth.

Le thème de la célébration de cette année est La sensibilité culturelle – s’adapter à la situation des élèves. La sensibilité culturelle met l’accent sur la création de rapports positifs entre les enseignants, le personnel scolaire, les élèves, les parents, les tuteurs et la collectivité afin d’en apprendre davantage sur les différentes cultures qui existent à la maison. Cette démarche garantit des écoles sûres et accueillantes où chaque élève se reconnaît tout au long de son cheminement d’apprentissage.

« Tous les élèves de la Nouvelle-Écosse devraient ressentir un sentiment d’appartenance à l’école, de dire Becky Druhan, ministre de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Ils devraient de sentir acceptés, en sécurité et valorisés. La sensibilité culturelle est un élément important de l’éducation inclusive et je suis très heureuse que la Semaine de l’éducation mette en vedette l’énorme travail qui se fait dans notre communauté scolaire afin de faire avancer les compétences culturelles. » 

La Semaine de l’éducation se déroule cette année du 24 au 30 avril et elle est le fruit de la coopération entre des intervenants du secteur de l’enseignement public en Nouvelle-Écosse, notamment :
-- le Ministère de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance,
-- le Syndicat des enseignants de la Nouvelle-Écosse,
-- la Fédération des associations foyer-école de la Nouvelle-Écosse,
-- la Fédération des parents acadiens de la Nouvelle-Écosse,
-- l’Association des administratrices et administrateurs des écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse,
-- le Conseil sur l'éducation afro-canadienne,
-- le Conseil de l'éducation mi'kmaq
-- la Commission de l'enseignement spécial des provinces de l'Atlantique.

Citation 
« La sensibilité culturelle contribue à des milieux d’apprentissage sûrs où les élèves peuvent s’exprimer et sentir qu’ils ont le soutien des autres. Préparer nos enfants à faire preuve d'inclusion et d'empathie dans leurs propres interactions est l'un des plus beaux cadeaux que l'on puisse leur offrir. »

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Cultural Responsiveness Highlighted During Education Week 2022","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Cultural Responsiveness Highlighted During Education Week 2022
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Education Week 2022 is an important opportunity for the education community to recognize teachers, administrators, early childhood educators, school support staff and education partners for outstanding work.

Sixty-nine award recipients from across Nova Scotia were honoured at a ceremony in Dartmouth today, April 25.

The theme of this year’s celebration is Cultural Responsiveness – Meeting Students Where They Are. Cultural responsiveness stresses positive relationship building between educators, school staff, students, parents, guardians, and the community in order to learn more about home cultures. This ensures safe, caring schools where every student sees themselves reflected throughout their learning journey.

“All Nova Scotian students should feel that they belong at school,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “They should feel accepted, safe, and valued. Cultural responsiveness is an important part of inclusive education and I’m very pleased that Education Week is spotlighting the great work in our education community to help advance cultural competence.”

Education Week, recognized this year from April 24 to 30, is a co-operative effort among public education stakeholders in Nova Scotia, including:
-- the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development
-- Nova Scotia Teachers Union
-- Nova Scotia Federation of Home and School Associations
-- Fédération des parents acadiens de la Nouvelle-Écosse
-- Public School Administrators Association of Nova Scotia
-- Council on African Canadian Education
-- Council of Mi’kmaq Education
-- Atlantic Provinces Special Education Authority.

Quotes: 
“Cultural responsiveness contributes to safe learning environments where students can express themselves and feel supported by others. I can think of no greater gift to give our children or prepare them to demonstrate inclusion and empathy in their own interactions.”

"Finance and Treasury Board","Budget 2022-23 Provides Solutions for a Bright Future","FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD--Budget 2022-23 Provides Solutions for a Bright Future
---------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Allan MacMaster, Minister of Finance and Treasury Board.
---------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s future is bright. With a thriving economy and record population growth, there are tremendous opportunities ahead for our province.

This government’s first budget, Budget 2022-23: Solutions for Healthcare, Solutions for Nova Scotians, reflects our optimism for our province’s future.

We are investing in solutions to our most pressing challenges, while planning for the needs of a growing, more sustainable and prosperous province.

Nova Scotians told us that improving healthcare is their most pressing concern. We’ve responded with a historic level of nearly $5.7 billion in funding to improve healthcare for Nova Scotians.

Our need for better mental health support drives the hiring of more mental healthcare professionals, opening the province's first mental health acute day hospital at the QEII Health Sciences Centre and improving virtual mental health services.

Access to primary care will improve by making virtual care available to everyone on the Need a Family Practice Registry, training 200 more nurses per year and performing more surgeries by expanding operating room hours and opening new beds.

We’ve introduced a new rebate for Nova Scotians who are struggling to expand their families through fertility treatments and surrogacy.

Seniors will benefit as we train and attract more continuing care assistants, provide more hours for one-on-one care in long-term care homes and continue to fund a $500 Seniors Care Grant, which helps older Nova Scotians living in their own homes.

It is clear Nova Scotia is a place where people want to live, work and build a life and this budget reflects our renewed focus on growing our economy.

We want more people moving to Nova Scotia. People drive the economy, especially young people. This is why we are choosing to invest in our young people and address labour shortages by returning the provincial personal income tax paid on the first $50,000 of earnings for people under the age of 30 in eligible sectors.

This budget also makes thoughtful investments in more affordable housing, immigration and tourism that benefit the entire province.

This is a compassionate budget that helps people live more independent lives, increases access to affordable child care and inclusive education, supports families with an increase to the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, and connects those experiencing homelessness with shelter and other support services. 

Budget 2022-23 reflects the promises we made to Nova Scotians and has now received approval from the House of Assembly. There’s more work to do, and we will continue to deliver solutions to Nova Scotia’s challenges.

----------------------------------------------------------------- 
The government passed a budget that makes historic investments in healthcare and passed legislation to support Nova Scotians and help them start families, dismantle racism and hate and enshrine Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s first language during the spring legislative session, which wrapped up today, April 22.  

The government also tabled Action for Health, a strategic plan to address recent and longstanding issues in healthcare. 

“We listened to Nova Scotians and healthcare workers across the province and are taking action based on feedback from those who know the system best,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We have a plan to move forward and the investment behind it to make transformational change. Now, we’re ready to continue our focused work.” 

Budget 2022-23: Solutions for Healthcare, Solutions for Nova Scotians includes a $5.7 billion investment in healthcare and solutions to improve the Province’s workforce, economy, housing and roads.

As part of the budget, amendments to the Income Tax Act were passed that will help Nova Scotians start a family. The government will offer a refundable tax credit equal to 40 per cent of the cost of fertility treatments provided by a Nova Scotia-licensed medical practitioner or infertility treatment clinic and for surrogacy-related medical expenses. This measure makes Nova Scotia the first province in Canada to provide this kind of support for surrogacy, including for the 2SLGBTIQ+ community who previously had no option but to pay the full cost.

The session began with the Premier delivering a statement on the war in Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelensky’s leadership during the crisis. Members of the Legislative Assembly unanimously passed the Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (Holodomor) Memorial Day Act, put forward by the Official Opposition, to create a memorial day each November to commemorate the millions of Ukrainians who died at the hands of a dictatorship-led famine ninety years ago.

The Dismantling Racism and Hate Act, developed by an all-party committee following extensive engagement with Nova Scotians, was also introduced this session and outlines the government’s approach to addressing systemic racism, hate and inequity. It also commits to developing a provincial strategy and a health equity framework by July 2023.

The government passed legislation recognizing Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s first language and will support efforts to preserve and promote it now and for future generations. 

“Last session the government passed 22 pieces of legislation. This session we passed another 31 important bills that will make a difference in the lives of Nova Scotians,” said Premier Houston. “We have an ambitious mandate to fix healthcare, increase housing, protect the environment and rebuild the economy and legislation passed this session will help us move forward.”

Among other legislation passed:
-- amendments to the Electricity Act to protect solar homeowners and small businesses in the solar industry
-- amendments to the Public Utilities Act that will push Nova Scotia Power to ensure that ratepayers have reliable, cleaner power and further hold the utility accountable for how it delivers electricity
-- amendments to the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Charter to help streamline, improve and shorten the approval process for residential housing developments
-- enable the government to create a wine authority to administer a quality standards program for Nova Scotia wines
-- amendments to the Liquor Control Act to permanently allow third-party delivery of alcohol with food orders 
-- amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act will permit the safe operation of electric kick scooters (e-scooters) on municipal roadways

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Les personnes de 70 ans et plus en Nouvelle-Écosse peuvent maintenant prendre rendez-vous pour une seconde dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

« Les doses de rappel ne sont pas seulement quelque chose de bien à faire, elles sont un élément important de votre protection et de celle des autres contre la COVID-19, de dire la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse.   Le nombre de doses dont vous avez besoin pour vous protéger le mieux possible contre le virus, surtout contre les manifestations graves de la maladie, diffère en fonction de votre âge et de votre état de santé. C’est pourquoi il est important de comprendre combien de doses du vaccin conviennent à vos besoins et à ceux des autres membres de votre famille et de prendre les rendez-vous nécessaires pour avoir le nombre de doses suffisant. »

La deuxième dose de rappel pour les personnes de 70 ans et plus est administrée au moins 120 jours après la première. Les vaccins de Pfizer et de Moderna sont recommandés pour la deuxième dose de rappel, mais les personnes qui ne peuvent pas recevoir ces vaccins d’ARNm pour des raisons médicales peuvent opter pour le vaccin de Novavax.

La Nouvelle-Écosse a aussi de nouvelles orientations concernant la dose de rappel pour les enfants de 12 à 17 ans, et elles sont basées sur les nouvelles recommandations du Comité consultatif national de l’immunisation. Tous les enfants dans cette fourchette d’âge sont maintenant encouragés à obtenir une dose de rappel. Ils doivent attendre 168 jours après leur deuxième dose du vaccin avant de recevoir la dose de rappel; toutefois, les enfants qui ont une immunodéficience moyenne ou grave peuvent recevoir la leur après 120 jours. Seul le vaccin de Pfizer est offert pour ce groupe d’âge. Les gens peuvent maintenant prendre rendez-vous.

Toute personne de 18 ans et plus qui n’a pas encore reçu une dose de rappel est aussi encouragée à prendre rendez-vous maintenant. La plupart des gens doivent attendre 168 jours après leur deuxième dose du vaccin, mais ceux qui ont une immunodéficience moyenne ou grave et les personnes de 70 ans et plus peuvent recevoir leur dose de rappel après 120 jours. 

On peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne à l’adresse https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/book-your-vaccination-appointment/fr/ ou en téléphonant au 1-833-797-7772. On peut prendre rendez-vous par téléphone du lundi au vendredi de 7 h à 19 h et les samedis et les dimanches de 10 h à 18 h. Les vaccins sont administrés à une pharmacie ou à une clinique sans rendez-vous, mais les rendez-vous doivent être pris en ligne ou par téléphone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le présent communiqué a été mis à jour lundi 25 avril pour préciser que les rendez-vous doivent être pris en ligne ou par téléphone.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Faits en bref
-- Les établissements de soins de longue durée et de soins pour bénéficiaires internes ont déjà commencé à offrir la deuxième dose de rappel à leurs résidents.
-- Le gouvernement travaille avec les communautés autochtones pour offrir la deuxième dose de rappel aux personnes qui sont le plus à risque.
-- On conseille aux personnes qui ont attrapé la COVID-19 récemment d’attendre 90 jours à compter de l’apparition des symptômes ou après avoir reçu un résultat positif au test avant de prendre rendez-vous pour une dose de rappel.
-- On conseille aux personnes qui ne sont pas vaccinées ou qui n’ont reçu qu’une dose du vaccin d’attendre 56 jours à compter de l’apparition des symptômes ou après avoir reçu un résultat positif au test avant de prendre rendez-vous pour une première ou une deuxième dose.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Update on COVID-19 Booster Doses for 70+, Youth","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Update on COVID-19 Booster Doses for 70+, Youth
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Adults 70 and older in Nova Scotia can now book an additional booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

“Boosters are more than just a nice-to-do – they are an important part of protecting yourself and others against COVID-19,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks, Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The number of doses you need to maximize your protection against COVID-19, particularly against severe outcomes, is different depending on your age and health status. That’s why it’s important to understand how many vaccine doses are right for you and the other members of your family and to book the appointments you need to stay up to date.”

The second booster dose for people 70 and older is administered at least 120 days after the first. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended for the second booster, but people who cannot receive those mRNA vaccines for medical reasons may opt for Novavax.

Nova Scotia also has new guidance on booster doses for children aged 12-17, based on updated recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. All children in that age group are now encouraged to get a booster dose. They must wait 168 days after their second vaccine dose to receive the booster, though children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are able to receive their booster dose after 120 days. Only the Pfizer vaccine is available for this age group. Bookings are now open.

Everyone 18 and older who has not yet received a booster dose is also encouraged to book an appointment now. Most people must wait 168 days after their second vaccine dose, but those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and people age 70 and older are able to receive their booster dose after 120 days.

Vaccine appointments may be booked online at: https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling 1-833-797-7772. Vaccine scheduling by phone is available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Vaccines are administered at pharmacies and drop-in clinics, and appointments must be booked online or by phone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This release was updated Monday, April 25, to clarify that vaccine appointments must be booked online or by phone.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Facts:
-- long-term and residential care facilities have already begun to offer second booster doses to residents
-- the government is working with Indigenous communities to offer second booster doses to those at highest risk
-- people with a recent COVID-19 infection are advised to wait 90 days from the onset of symptoms or a positive test before booking a booster dose
-- people who are unvaccinated or have only one dose of vaccine are advised to wait 56 days from the onset of symptoms or a positive test before booking a first or second dose
-- as of April 21, 64.5 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness","Plan stratégique pour améliorer les soins de santé en Nouvelle-Écosse","BUREAU DU PREMIER MINISTRE/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Plan stratégique pour améliorer les soins de santé en Nouvelle-Écosse
----------------------------------------------------------------
Le gouvernement a rendu public le Plan d’action pour la santé, un plan stratégique qui s’attaque à des problèmes de longue date et à d’autres plus récents dans les soins actifs et primaires, les soins de longue durée, la santé mentale et le traitement des dépendances, et les facteurs qui influent chaque jour sur le bien-être des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

« Le message qui nous a été transmis à maintes reprises est clair : afin de pouvoir offrir de meilleurs soins et de soutenir et de respecter le personnel de la santé, il faut que les choses changent, a déclaré aujourd’hui, 22 avril, le premier ministre Tim Houston. Il s’agit d’un tournant pour la Nouvelle-Écosse. Alors que nous passons de la détermination des problèmes à leur résolution, je suis sûr que nous allons dans la bonne direction, car les avis exprimés par les personnes qui connaissent le mieux le système nous orientent dans notre travail. »

Le plan vise d’abord à créer un système où les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse peuvent recevoir en temps opportun des soins de santé de calibre mondial, et où les fournisseurs de soins de santé sont respectés, valorisés et écoutés. Au moyen de ce plan, le gouvernement s’engage à améliorer la diversité et l’équité à l’échelle du système.

Le Plan d’action pour la santé est la réponse de la Province à la tournée Speak Up for Healthcare, soit une série de rencontres tenues l’automne dernier avec les fournisseurs et les chefs de file du milieu de la santé, et aux commentaires des Néo-Écossais formulés autour d’un café, lors de rencontres impromptues et dans les salles de réunion de conseils d’administration au cours des dernières années.

Ces rencontres ont permis de cerner trois éléments fondamentaux :
-- le recrutement et le maintien en poste des professionnels des soins de santé;
-- l’accès aux soins;
-- un infrastructure physique et numérique dépassée.

Pour remédier aux problèmes dans ces secteurs, le plan présente six solutions assorties de leurs objectifs et mesures à prendre. La Province :
-- deviendra un pôle d’attraction pour les prestataires de services de santé;
-- fournira les soins dont les Néo-Écossais ont besoin et qu’ils méritent; 
-- cultivera l’excellence en première ligne;
-- renforcera la responsabilité à tous les niveaux;
-- sera réactive et résiliente;
-- ciblera les facteurs qui influent sur la santé et le mieux-être.

Le Plan d’action pour la santé est disponible ici : https://novascotia.ca/actionforhealth/fr 

Le gouvernement a déjà pris des mesures pour améliorer les soins de santé : 
-- offre d’emploi à toutes les infirmières diplômées en Nouvelle-Écosse et élaboration d’un programme de mentorat pour les infirmières;
-- ouverture de centres de traitement d’urgence à North Sydney et à Parrsboro; 
-- ajout de nouveaux véhicules et de travailleurs pour doubler les transferts de patients et permettre aux ambulanciers paramédicaux de se concentrer sur les urgences; 
-- élargissement des soins virtuels aux gens inscrits au registre des personnes ayant besoin d’un médecin de famille; 
-- investissement de 57 millions de dollars pour attirer et maintenir en poste plus de personnes pour travailler dans le secteur des soins continus, y compris fournir la gratuité des droits de scolarité à plus de 2 000 étudiants dans les programmes d’auxiliaires en soins continus au cours des deux prochaines années, et pour mettre plus rapidement des lits à la disposition des personnes âgées;  
-- augmentation d’environ 23 p. 100 des salaires des auxiliaires en soins continus syndiqués et non syndiqués dans le secteur public;  
-- lancement d’une campagne de recrutement pour attirer des professionnels de la santé et création d’une équipe chargée d’orienter les professionnels de la santé vers les informations nécessaires à leur installation en Nouvelle-Écosse;
-- ouverture d’un nouveau centre de soutien au rétablissement à Dartmouth pour aider les gens qui cherchent de l’aide pour lutter contre l’utilisation de drogues et le jeu compulsif;
-- ouverture du premier hôpital de jour de soins actifs en santé mentale de la province au Centre des sciences de la santé QEII.

Citation
« Je suis encouragée par le fait que le gouvernement provincial s’est donné comme priorité de parler directement avec les travailleurs de la santé afin de mettre en œuvre de vraies solutions aux problèmes du système de soins de santé. Je suis très fière de mon rôle au sein de l’équipe à l’hôpital général de Digby. Nous espérons que ce travail pour améliorer les soins de santé nous permettra de fournir de meilleurs soins aux patients et aux localités que nous servons. »
     - Mallory Francis, infirmière auxiliaire autorisée, Hôpital général de Digby

Faits en bref
-- Le budget de la Province pour 2022-2023 met l’accent sur des solutions en matière de soins de santé et les dépenses à ce chapitre augmentent de 413,4 millions de dollars pour faire passer le budget total à 5,7 milliards de dollars.
-- Mesurer le succès est un élément clé du Plan d’action pour la santé; le gouvernement sera transparent dans cette démarche et il utilisera des mesures du rendement qui seront facilement accessibles au public ici : https://novascotia.ca/actionforhealth/fr  
-- Les réactions à la tournée Speak Up for Healthcare ont été multiples : 2 391 participations au forum en ligne; 254 rencontres pour écouter les gens; 5 tables rondes; 67 présentations vidéo faites au premier ministre, plus de 200 cartes de commentaires et plus de 60 présentations par courriel.

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness","Strategic Plan to Improve Healthcare in Nova Scotia","PREMIER’S OFFICE/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Strategic Plan to Improve Healthcare in Nova Scotia
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government released Action for Health, a strategic plan to address recent and long-standing problems in acute and primary care, long-term care, addictions and mental health and the factors that affect the well-being of Nova Scotians every day. 

“The message we’ve heard over and over again is clear – change is needed to provide better health and better healthcare for Nova Scotians and to support and respect the people who work in the system,” said Premier Tim Houston today, April 22. “This is a turning point for Nova Scotia. As we move from identifying problems to fixing them, I am confident we are heading in the right direction because we are guided by input from those who know the system best.”

The plan is focused on creating a system where Nova Scotians can access world-class healthcare in a timely manner and health providers are respected, valued and heard. It commits to improving diversity and equity throughout the system.

Action for Health is the Province’s response to the Speak Up For Healthcare Tour – listening sessions with health leaders and providers held last fall – and feedback from Nova Scotians on doorsteps, over coffee and in boardrooms during the past few years.

These sessions identified three core issues:
-- recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals
-- access to care
-- outdated infrastructure, both physical and digital.

To fix the problems in those areas, the plan presents six broad solutions and the objectives and actions required for each. The Province will:
-- become a magnet for health providers
-- provide the care Nova Scotians need and deserve
-- cultivate excellence on the frontlines
-- build in accountability at every level
-- be responsive and resilient
-- address the factors affecting health and well-being.

Action for Health is available at: https://novascotia.ca/actionforhealth

The government has already taken action on improving healthcare by: 
– offering jobs to all graduating nurses in Nova Scotia and developing a nursing mentorship program
-- opening urgent treatment centres in North Sydney and Parrsboro
-- adding new vehicles and staff to double patient transfers and enable paramedics to focus on emergencies
-- expanding virtual care to Nova Scotians on the Need a Family Practice registry
-- investing $57 million to attract and retain more people to work in continuing care, including providing free tuition for more than 2,000 continuing care assistant students over the next two years, and to open beds more quickly to seniors
-- increasing wages of continuing care assistants in the publicly funded continuing care sector by up to 23 per cent
-- launching a recruitment campaign to attract healthcare professionals and creating a team of navigators to connect healthcare professionals with the information they need to support their move to Nova Scotia
-- opening a new recovery support centre in Dartmouth for people seeking help with substance use or gambling
-- opening the province’s first mental health acute day hospital at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax.

Quotes:
“I am encouraged the provincial government made it a priority to speak directly to healthcare workers in order to start putting in place real solutions to the issues facing our healthcare system. I am very proud of my role as part of the team at Digby General Hospital. We are hopeful this work to improve healthcare will allow us to provide enhanced care to our patients and the communities we serve.”
     - Mallory Francis, licensed practical nurse, Digby General Hospital

Quick Facts:
-- the Province’s 2022-23 budget is focused on solutions for healthcare and increases healthcare spending by $413.4 million to $5.7 billion

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report
--------------------------------------------------------
The data in this week’s COVID-19 epidemiologic summary points to a possible stabilization in two key metrics after a period of steady increases. In this seven-day reporting period, the number of lab-confirmed cases and the number of cases linked to long-term care outbreaks are similar to levels in the previous six-day reporting period. 

“After several weeks of increases, the data suggests we may have hit the peak of the wave when it comes to new COVID-19 infections,” said Dr. Shelley Deeks. Nova Scotia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. “For many, COVID has been a mild to moderate illness with symptoms that can be managed at home. But that is not the case for everyone, especially older people, which makes our individual actions – getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, keeping our social circles small – that much more important.”

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for the Chief Medical Officer of Health and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The report is posted on government’s coronavirus website at:  https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries 

For the seven-day period ending April 18:
-- there were 7,508 positive PCR tests performed at the lab
-- there were 84 hospital admissions due to COVID-19 
-- there were 13 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system
-- the median age of COVID-19 reported deaths since the start of the Omicron wave (December 8, 2021) is 80
-- the median length of a COVID-19 hospital stay is 6.8 days.

As of April 21, 64.5 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose.

--------------------------------------------------------
Les données contenues dans le sommaire épidémiologique sur la COVID-19 cette semaine laissent entrevoir une possible stabilisation dans deux paramètres clés après une période d’augmentations soutenues. Durant la période de sept jours visée par le rapport d’aujourd’hui, le nombre de cas confirmés en laboratoire et le nombre de cas liés aux éclosions dans les établissements de soins de longue durée sont semblables aux nombres observés durant la période précédente de six jours. 

« Après plusieurs semaines d’augmentations, les données suggèrent que nous pourrions avoir atteint le pic de la vague des nouvelles infections causées par la COVID-19, de dire la Dre Shelley Deeks, médecin-hygiéniste en chef adjointe de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Pour beaucoup, la COVID aura provoqué une maladie de légère à modérée avec des symptômes que les gens peuvent gérer à la maison. Mais ce n’est pas le cas pour tout le monde, surtout pour les personnes âgées, ce qui donne encore plus d’importance aux gestes que nous posons, soit de nous faire vacciner, de porter un masque et de garder nos cercles sociaux petits. »

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le médecin-hygiéniste en chef et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés. Le rapport est affiché dans le site Web du gouvernement sur le coronavirus : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#epidemiologic-summaries (rapport en anglais seulement). 

Pour la période de sept jours se terminant le 18 avril :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 7 508 ont donné un résultat positif. 
-- Quatre-vingt-quatre nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19. 
-- Durant cette période, 13 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 depuis le début de la vague Omicron (le 8 décembre 2021) est de 80 ans.
-- La durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,8 jours.

Au 21 avril, 64,5 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel.

"Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services","Funeral Home Licence Suspended","SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES--Funeral Home Licence Suspended
----------------------------------------------------------------
Forest Haven Memorial Gardens in Sydney will have its crematorium licence suspended for two months effective Thursday, April 28, for a wrongful cremation that occurred last December. The suspension means the funeral home cannot do cremations during this time.

A hearing was held by the Provincial Registrar of Embalmers and Funeral Directors on March 11. It found Forest Haven Memorial Gardens to be in contravention of the Embalmers and Funeral Directors Act for failing to ensure proper identification requirements are in place and followed. In addition to the licence suspension, the funeral homeowner is required to provide the registrar with Forest Haven’s documented standardized process to ensure the continuous identification of human remains.

Forest Haven Memorial Gardens keeps its Cemetery and Funeral Services licence and is allowed to carry on cemetery activities during this time.

“No family should have to experience what this family is going through,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “Now that the hearing has taken place and the registrar has made her decision, the Department will work with the Board of Registration of Embalmers and Funeral Directors and the Funeral Service Association to see what needs to be done to improve compliance with the current legislative requirements.”

In March, the Nova Scotia Board of Registration of Embalmers and Funeral Directors revoked the licence of the funeral director involved with the wrongful cremation.

The Notice of Decision about Forest Haven Memorial Garden’s Crematorium license can be found here: https://beta.novascotia.ca/hearing-and-enforcement-action-notices-cemeteries-and-funeral-homes .

Quick Facts:

"Justice","Independent Review of Accessibility Act Launches","JUSTICE--Independent Review of Accessibility Act Launches
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Consultations for the first independent review of the Accessibility Act launched today, April 21.

Katie Aubrecht, an associate professor in the sociology department at St. Francis Xavier University and Director of its Spatializing Care: Intersectional Disability Studies Lab, is leading the review.

She will be consulting with persons with disabilities, organizations that serve them, and others affected by the legislation and then submit a report with recommendations to the Minister of Justice.

“We want to hear from Nova Scotians, particularly those directly impacted by the implementation of the Accessibility Act and continue to build a more equitable and accessible province by 2030,” said Justice Minister Brad Johns. “We look forward to the completion of the review and Dr. Aubrecht’s independent findings.”

The review will focus on the standards development process, identifying possible changes to the act, and the implementation of the plan to make Nova Scotia accessible by 2030.

More information about the various ways to participate in the review is available at: https://nsaccessreview.ca/ 

The review is expected to take eight to 10 months to complete. The final report will be available to the public.

"Develop Nova Scotia","High-Speed Internet for More Nova Scotians","DEVELOP NOVA SCOTIA--High-Speed Internet for More Nova Scotians
-----------------------------------------------------------------
High-speed internet will reach another 400 Nova Scotia homes and businesses under new contracts with Eastlink and Bell signed by Develop Nova Scotia.

Eastlink will expand access to 66 more homes and businesses in the Annapolis Valley and is working with Develop Nova Scotia on solutions for other underserved areas across the province. Bell will expand access to 333 more homes and businesses located in smaller, less populated areas across the province.

“We know that reliable, high-speed internet access for all Nova Scotians cannot come soon enough,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development. “It’s a vital service in today’s world and plays a key role in helping communities across our province, particularly in rural Nova Scotia, seize economic opportunities and reach their full potential.”

The Nova Scotia Internet Funding Trust has approved $1.7 million for these projects. Another $446,000 is coming from private sector investments.

With the additional high-speed internet coverage provided by Nova Scotia Internet Funding Trust projects announced to date, the municipal-led project in Pictou and Bell’s Wireless Home Internet Service, it is expected that 99.5 per cent of Nova Scotia’s homes and businesses will have high-speed access by the end of 2023.

Develop Nova Scotia is working with internet service providers to identify solutions for the remaining 4,000 underserved homes and businesses across the province, of which about 1,000 do not have commercial power. The goal is to achieve high-speed internet access for as close to 100 per cent of the remaining homes and businesses as possible.

Quotes:
“New connections are happening daily and by the end of March, approximately 89 per cent of Nova Scotians have access to high-speed internet. Together with our internet service provider partners, we are working hard to ensure projects underway are delivered on time and to identify solutions for the remaining homes and businesses. Thanks to this announcement with Bell and Eastlink, we are one step closer to our goal.” 
     - Jennifer Angel, President and CEO, Develop Nova Scotia

“At a time when fast and reliable internet connections are more important than ever, we’re proud to bring our pure fibre connection, in partnership with Develop Nova Scotia, to households and businesses in rural and underserved communities across the province. For those in hard-to-reach areas, through partnerships and innovations like our Wireless Home Internet service, Bell is advancing our long-standing objective to connect communities throughout Nova Scotia and across our footprint.” 
     - Glen LeBlanc, CFO and Vice-Chair Atlantic, Bell

“As a company rooted in delivering high-speed internet to smaller towns and communities, we are very pleased to be working with Develop Nova Scotia on expanding access to more Nova Scotians.” 
     - Jeff Gillham, CEO, Eastlink

"Premier's Office / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Nova Scotia Enhances Support for Ukrainians","PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Nova Scotia Enhances Support for Ukrainians
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is working with the YMCA to provide more support for Ukrainian newcomers arriving in Nova Scotia. The government is also streamlining the immigration process for Ukrainians.

“Nova Scotians have a history of helping people and we will continue to do so in response to the humanitarian crisis Ukrainians are facing now,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We are prepared to welcome these newcomers with open arms and provide them with the necessary supports to find stability after facing some of the darkest days of their lives.”

The Province has engaged the YMCA as a community partner to help provide information to Ukrainians who want to connect with employers and community. The YMCA, with its reach of settlement and language services across the province, will help answer questions, assess the needs of Ukrainian newcomers, and help connect them to the information they need. These efforts will include collaboration with multiple community partners including Immigration Services of Nova Scotia and the Ukrainian Canadian Congress – Nova Scotia Branch.

“We are working with the local Ukrainian community and settlement partners to identify ways to address gaps in supports for Ukrainians coming to Nova Scotia, ensuring we all work together to help people navigate their transition to life here,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “Language training, information sessions, guidance to help access the labour market and services tailored to the needs of women, seniors, youth and 2SLGBTIQ+ people will better support Ukrainians looking to settle in our communities.”

To further support Ukrainian nationals, the Province is easing requirements for immigration and settlement programs. Applications are being processed urgently, and language tests, recruitment requirements and settlement funds are not barriers to applications under the Skilled Worker or Occupations in Demand streams of the Nova Scotia Nominee Program. Ukrainian newcomers will also be eligible for all provincially funded settlement programming.

The Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration will have online information sessions available on how Ukrainians can access its programs. The sessions will also include information from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to provide information on temporary federal measures.

Quotes:
“Our YMCA has a long history of supporting the settlement of newcomer children, youth, and their families in our province. While we are part of a global movement of YMCAs around the world working with our international partners during times of crisis, here in Nova Scotia our approach is to deliver community-based, grassroots services that are inclusive and welcoming. While considering the settlement needs of newcomers to Nova Scotia, the YMCA also works with communities to foster an understanding of the issues and barriers newcomers face. We are pleased to partner with the Province of Nova Scotia and other stakeholders to support this important initiative.”
     - Brian Posavad, President and CEO, YMCA of Greater Halifax/Dartmouth

Quick Facts: 
-- in March, the Province donated $100,000 to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation to provide humanitarian support such as food, medical aid and emergency shelter
-- there are more than 9,000 people of Ukrainian heritage living in Nova Scotia

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Province Creates Community Housing Growth Fund","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Province Creates Community Housing Growth Fund
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing $2.5 million to create a community housing growth fund to strengthen the sector and grow the number of non-profit housing units in Nova Scotia.

“Non-profit and co-operative housing play an important role in helping to create healthy, vibrant and affordable communities,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “Growing the sector is key to increasing the supply of affordable housing options and that means groups need the tools and expertise to oversee new developments and manage ongoing operations effectively. This delivers on the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission’s recommendation to create a community housing growth fund.”

The Community Housing Transformation Centre will administer the program and allocate funds to approved projects over the next two years. Areas of focus include:
-- capacity building 
-- planning and pre-development
-- research and innovation
-- creation of a new Provincial Non-Profit Housing Association.

The centre will also contribute $550,000 to support capacity building in the sector and the operational needs of the non-profit housing association.

Selection committees, which will include representatives of the centre, Department of Municipal Affairs and Housing and community housing sector, will review and approve projects.

The program guidelines are in development and a call for proposals will be issued in the coming months.

Quotes:
“The centre is very pleased to see this major project come to fruition. This is an important step forward in structuring community housing in Nova Scotia and we are proud to be part of it.”
     - Stephan Corriveau, Executive Director, Community Housing Transformation Centre

“This is an exciting and essential development. It puts the province on a path in the right direction. Developing the capacity of the community housing sector is a central and key component to addressing affordable housing in Nova Scotia.”
     - Timothy Crooks, Executive Director, Phoenix Youth Programs; Board President, Canadian Housing and Renewal Association

Quick Facts:
-- the Community Housing Transformation Centre is a non-profit group that provides financial support and organizational development tools to community housing organizations across Canada
-- the centre has allocated more than $800,000 in grants to community housing in Nova Scotia over the past three years
-- in 2021-22, the Province invested more than $35 million to create over 1,100 new affordable housing units across the province, including 425 rent supplements

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Rapport hebdomadaire des données sur la COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------
Le rapport épidémiologique de cette semaine sur la COVID-19 montre une augmentation continue des résultats positifs des tests analysés en laboratoire et une augmentation correspondante des données utilisées pour surveiller les cas de complications graves. En raison du taux élevé de vaccination, il y a moins d'hospitalisation ou de décès liés à la COVID-19, en pourcentage du nombre total de cas.

« Nous savons que les vaccins offrent une excellente protection contre des symptômes graves dans tous les groupes d'âge, mais il est évident que l'impact le plus important est sur les adultes plus âgés, qui sont plus à risque de complications graves, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. L'impact le plus important est sur les personnes qui ont reçu au moins trois doses, soit une série primaire complète et une dose de rappel. Une dose de rappel réduit le risque d'hospitalisation de plus de 80 % et le risque de décès de plus de 90 % comparativement aux personnes qui ne sont pas vaccinées ou qui n'ont reçu qu'une seule dose. »

Le rapport de cette semaine couvre une période de six jours, soit du 6 au 11 avril. Les futurs rapports couvriront une période de sept jours, soit du mardi au lundi. Cet ajustement permettra à l'équipe de la Santé publique responsable des données et de la surveillance de recueillir, de valider et d'analyser les renseignements. Le communiqué de presse sera toujours publié le jeudi.

Le résumé hebdomadaire contient un nouveau tableau qui indique le nombre et le taux d'hospitalisations et de décès par groupe d'âge pendant la vague Omicron, qui a débuté le 8 décembre 2021. Ces données, en plus des autres données incluses dans le rapport hebdomadaire, aident le public à mieux comprendre les deux plus importants facteurs de risque pour les complications graves et les décès, soit l'âge et le statut vaccinal. 

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 est préparé pour le Dr Strang et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés. Le rapport sera affiché chaque semaine dans le site Web du gouvernement sur le coronavirus. Les données du tableau de bord seront mises à jour chaque semaine jusqu'au 28 avril. 

Le rapport de cette semaine se trouve ici : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/fr/#epidemiologic-summaries

Pour la période de six jours se terminant le 11 avril :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 6 912 ont donné un résultat positif. 
-- Soixante-douze nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19. 
-- Durant cette période, 14 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 depuis le début de la vague Omicron est de 80 ans.
-- La durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,8 jours.
-- Au 14 avril, 64,2 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Weekly Data Report","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Weekly Data Report
---------------------------------------------------------------
This week’s COVID-19 data report shows a continued increase in the number of lab-confirmed infections and corresponding increase in the metrics used to monitor severe outcomes. Because of widespread vaccine coverage, there are fewer people as a percentage of total cases ending up in hospital or dying of COVID-19.

“We know vaccines offer excellent protection against severe outcomes – and that’s true for all age groups – but we see the impact most clearly in older adults, whose risk of severe outcomes is highest,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We see the highest impact in those with at least three doses – that is, a complete primary series and a booster. A booster dose of vaccine lowers a person’s risk of hospitalization by more than 80 per cent and the risk of death from COVID by more than 90 per cent compared to those who are unvaccinated or have only one dose.”

This week’s report covers a six-day period from April 6 to April 11. Future reports will cover seven days, from Tuesday to Monday. This adjustment allows public health’s data and surveillance team more time to collect, validate and analyze information. The release will continue to be distributed on Thursdays.

The weekly summary has a new table which shows the number and rate of hospitalizations and deaths by age group during the Omicron wave, which started December 8, 2021. This, along with other information in the weekly report, helps public health better understand the two biggest risk factors for severe disease and death, which are age and vaccination status. 

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary is prepared for Dr. Strang and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic. It tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. The report is posted weekly on the government’s coronavirus website. The data dashboard will be updated weekly until April 28. 

This week’s report can be found here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/#epidemiologic-summaries

For the six-day period ending April 11:
-- there were 6,912 positive PCR tests performed at the lab
-- there were 72 new hospital admissions due to COVID-19 
-- there were 14 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system
-- the median age of COVID-19 reported deaths since the start of the Omicron wave is 80
-- the median length of a COVID-19 hospital stay is 6.8 days.

As of April 14, 64.2 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A statement by Premier Tim Houston, read in the House of Assembly today, April 14, follows the release.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is asking Nova Scotians to come together to remember those who lost their lives on April 18 and 19, 2020.

People are encouraged to pause for a moment of silence at noon on both Monday, April 18, and Tuesday, April 19, to remember those lost, honour the survivors and reflect on the events of two years ago.

“April 18 and 19, 2020, forever changed us as Nova Scotians. Two years after this unspeakable tragedy, the heartbreak and sorrow remain,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We cannot imagine the pain and suffering the victims’ families have endured. We stand with you today and on all days.”

The flags at Province House will be at half-mast from sunrise on April 18 to sunset on April 19. Flags at all provincial government buildings and institutions will also be at half-mast. Citizens, businesses and community organizations who fly flags are also encouraged to lower them to half-mast for April 18 and 19.

This fall, the Province will introduce legislation to establish April 18 and 19 as Provincial Days of Remembrance. Before introducing that legislation, the Province will consult with the victims’ families to ensure their loved ones are remembered appropriately.

Remembering and reflecting on the events of 2020 may impact Nova Scotians in different ways. People in need of emotional support can call 211 to reach a community resource navigator who can connect them with help. Anyone experiencing a mental health crisis can call the Provincial Mental Health and Addictions Crisis Line any time at 1-888-429-8167.

Statement by Premier Tim Houston:

Mr. Speaker, today we mark a solemn occasion as we remember our fellow Nova Scotians who lost their lives on April 18 and 19, 2020.

Together we remember Tom Bagley, Kristen Beaton and her unborn child, Greg Blair, Jamie Blair, Joy Bond, Peter Bond, Lillian Campbell, Corrie Ellison, Gina Goulet, Alanna Jenkins, Sean McLeod, Dawn Gulenchyn, Frank Gulenchyn, Lisa McCully, Heather O'Brien, Jolene Oliver, Aaron Tuck, Emily Tuck, Heidi Stevenson, Joanne Thomas, John Zahl, and Joey Webber.

Two years after this unspeakable tragedy, the heartbreak and sorrow remain.

We cannot imagine the pain and suffering the victims’ families have endured over the last two years. We stand with you today and on all days.

April 18 and 19 forever changed us as Nova Scotians.

In remembrance of the lives lost and in honour of the strength and courage of the survivors, flags throughout the province will be lowered from sunrise on Monday, April 18, until sundown on Tuesday, April 19.

We also ask all Nova Scotians to pause at noon on both days and join together to observe a moment of silence.

It is important that we stand together this year and in all future years. This fall, we also plan to introduce legislation to establish April 18 and 19 as Provincial Days of Remembrance. Before introducing that legislation, we will consult with the families through the Department of Justice to ensure we are remembering their loved ones in the ways they think they should be remembered.

As we are doing this year, the Days of Remembrance will allow us to collectively remember the lives lost and reflect on how those days also brought us together as a community, as a province, and as a nation. They united us and showed our collective strength.

That resilience is most evident in family members left behind and in the individuals and groups that have been supporting them – schools, community groups and many other organizations have been there to help.

Together we remain Nova Scotia strong.

Mr. Speaker, following comments from the members opposite, I ask that all members of the Legislature join together in a minute of silence to honour those we lost two years ago. We will always remember them, hold them in our thoughts and in our hearts.","https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20220414004","2022-04-14T13:37:00.000"
"Environment and Climate Change","Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities to Deliver Sustainable Communities Challenge Fund","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities to Deliver Sustainable Communities Challenge Fund
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Communities across the province will benefit from funding to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create jobs.

The Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities was selected through a request for proposals process to develop and administer the Sustainable Communities Challenge Fund, first announced in January.

The fund will provide $15 million over three years for projects which will help communities adapt to climate change and help the province meet its greenhouse gas emission targets.

“Nova Scotians are increasingly experiencing the effects of climate change and are concerned about its impacts on their communities, livelihoods, the environment and their way of life,” said Environment and Climate Change Minister Timothy Halman. “The task before us is clear – we must act now and with urgency, not just the provincial government, but all Nova Scotians. This fund – and the leadership of the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities – will help empower our communities and municipalities to take action to build a more sustainable, equitable and climate-resilient future.”

Setting up this fund is a goal in the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act and part of the government’s multi-pronged response to climate change. Later this spring, the Department will release an updated climate risk assessment and a climate plan.

Quotes:
“Being chosen to develop and administer the Sustainable Communities Challenge Fund is a recognition of NSFM's historic and ongoing work with climate-related initiatives. It also recognizes our long-standing reputation for working with a diverse cross-section of stakeholders to achieve collective action. We are excited to work with the Province of Nova Scotia, and all of the organizations eligible for the SCCF, to advance projects that will help our communities mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.”
     - Juanita Spencer, CEO, Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities

Quick Facts:
-- the Sustainable Community Challenge Fund was announced January 17 as part of Green Fund investments
-- the Green Fund is revenue collected under the Province’s cap and trade program; the revenue is set aside to be reinvested in climate change initiatives
-- auctions in the cap and trade program in 2021 raised $44.8 million

The new care model will ensure that families have access to earlier intervention and that they are aware of what services are available, how to access them and who is eligible. Families and service providers will also have access to the education they need to best support the individual needs of each child.

“This is about making sure children on the autism spectrum and their families have access to appropriate interventions and supports,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “Families have to wait too long to get the support they need and that needs to change. This will reduce waits for programs and ensure that children are receiving the right level of care at the right time regardless of where in the province they live.”

Enhanced services include:
-- a single point of access to supports for families and children
-- the creation of autism spectrum disorder intervention teams that will provide targeted, focused and comprehensive services based on goals and needs identified by families
-- a central waitlist for diagnosis, more clinicians dedicated to conducting diagnostic assessments, and training for community physicians to engage in autism diagnosis
-- an intensive 12-month intervention program for children identified with the greatest social communication and behaviour needs
-- provincewide access to the QuickStart Nova Scotia program for toddlers
-- educational resources and programs, including online modules and education session for caregivers, families and providers.

The new model was developed in partnership with Autism Nova Scotia, Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia Health Authority, IWK Health, and the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, and a representative of families with autistic children. The supports will be rolled out over the next two years.

Quotes:
“We are grateful to the provincial government for recognizing the need for a larger investment in autism supports. Once fully realized, this investment will create a comprehensive integrated service delivery system for autism that will better support families as they begin their journey in the early years.”
     - Cynthia Carroll, Executive Director, Autism Nova Scotia

“As a mother of two children on the autism spectrum, I was honoured to be given the opportunity to be a voice for families and to work alongside government, the IWK, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia and Autism Nova Scotia to develop solutions and services that will directly impact children. Believing in children is the key to their success but believing in autistic children can change their lives.”
     - Lisa Foley, parent and advisory committee member

Quick Facts:
-- the new care model is supported by a $12-million dollar investment announced in Budget 2022-2023
-- on average, one in 34 five-year-old children in the province have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
-- QuickStart Nova Scotia is an early intervention, parent-mediated coaching program for families of toddlers suspected of or diagnosed with autism; the program is currently only offered to families in Halifax Regional Municipality

------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development will maintain the mask requirement in Nova Scotia’s public schools until at least the May long weekend.

Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, said today, April 13, that students, staff, outside service providers, volunteers and visitors must continue to wear a mask during school instructional hours and on school buses.

“Throughout the pandemic, we’ve worked with Public Health to keep kids in schools,” said Minister Druhan. “Our approach has allowed us to keep schools open for most of the year and allowed our students to continue in-person learning. I know it hasn’t been easy, but I’d like to thank the teachers, staff, students and families for their hard work and commitment to children’s learning and well-being.”

Minister Druhan said the decision to require masks in schools supports operational considerations and will be reassessed closer to May 20.

Students, staff and visitors are also asked to continue to follow core public health measures, including getting vaccinated if eligible, staying home if feeling unwell, following the COVID-19 daily checklist, and washing and sanitizing hands frequently.

Quick Facts:
-- a supply of masks will continue to be available to students and staff
-- rapid testing kits will continue to be provided to students and staff at public schools as needed

Le ministère de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance continuera d'exiger le port du masque dans les écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse au moins jusqu'à la fête de la Reine en mai.

Aujourd'hui 13 avril, Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, a annoncé que les élèves, le personnel, les fournisseurs de services externes, les bénévoles et les visiteurs doivent continuer de porter un masque pendant les heures de classe et dans les autobus scolaires.

« Pendant la pandémie, nous avons collaboré avec la Santé pour permettre aux enfants d'aller à l'école, souligne la ministre Druhan. Notre approche nous a permis de garder les écoles ouvertes pendant la majorité de l'année afin de continuer l'apprentissage en personne. Je sais que ça n'a pas été facile, et je remercie les enseignants, le personnel, les élèves et les familles pour leur dévouement à l'apprentissage et au bien-être de l'apprentissage des enfants. »

La ministre Druhan signale que la décision d'exiger le port du masque dans les écoles sera réévaluée en fonction des exigences opérationnelles avant le 20 mai.

On demande aux élèves, au personnel et aux visiteurs de continuer de respecter les mesures de base en matière de santé publique, y compris se faire vacciner s'ils sont admissibles, rester à la maison s'ils ne se sentent pas bien, utiliser la liste de contrôle quotidien pour la COVID-19 et se laver et désinfecter les mains souvent.

New funding for the Eskasoni Crisis and Referral Centre will support mental health and addictions related services for Eskasoni First Nation and Mi’kmaw people across the province.

The government is providing a one-time investment of $350,000 to the centre, which provides 24-hour crisis intervention and referral services – in both Mi’kmaw and English – over the phone, online and in person to people living in Mi’kmaw communities.

“Providing better access to mental health services includes receiving culturally appropriate care in a language that is known and is familiar to those reaching out for help,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “The Eskasoni Crisis and Referral Centre is a great example of supports built for community by the community. We are happy to be able to support the tremendous work being led by the centre, which I believe will lead to better mental health outcomes for the people of Eskasoni and members of Mi’kmaw communities across the province.”

The funding will support services that:
-- improve the well-being of community members
-- reduce stigma around accessing mental health services
-- reduce the incidence of suicide
-- help support harm reduction practices
-- connect individuals and families with mental health services.

Quotes:
“We are grateful for this funding announcement and this partnership with the Nova Scotia government. It will provide much needed funding to continue our mission to improve the well-being of community members, improve access to mental health services, help support those dealing with addiction, and provide immediate in the moment Mi’kmaw appropriate response to those in crisis 24 hours a day 365 days a year.”

“I am passionate about helping those in need and providing an area where someone can be cared for and safe. This funding will help us to keep offering these services to our community.”
     - Kyla Paige Francis, Team Lead, Eskasoni Crisis and Referral Centre

“Before taking on the position of support worker, I was a client of the centre. The tools that I got I still use today. When I fell to the lowest and felt like I lost trust in myself and others, staff at the centre were there to help. What made me want to be crisis worker was so that I can give back and help our community like it helped me.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is joining its Maritime counterparts to provide financial support to Coach Atlantic Maritime Bus (Maritime Bus) to maintain bus operations throughout the region. The Province has allocated more than $400,000 to the company.

“Maritime Bus provides an important, accessible and affordable bus service linking Nova Scotia communities within our province and to our Maritime neighbours,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “We are working with our counterparts in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island to keep the service viable.”

This financial support will help the company cover its losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, maintain rural and northern routes, and respond to the increased desire to travel as the economy and tourism begin to rebound.

New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are contributing a combined $500,000 to the company. The financial support of each province is proportional, based on the ratio of kilometres driven by Maritime Bus in each province.

Quick Facts:
-- Maritime Bus is a family-owned and operated business based in Prince Edward Island
-- prior to the pandemic, Maritime Bus employed more than 200 people in Nova Scotia
-- the company took over Acadian Lines routes in 2012 after Acadian abandoned its scheduled service operations in Atlantic Canada
-- Maritime Bus also provides parcel freight services, including blood shipped by Canadian Blood Services throughout the Maritime hospital network and other medical shipments among hospitals and pharmacies

----------------------------------------------------------------
The appointment process for senior leadership positions at the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service (PPS) will be updated through amendments to the Public Prosecutions Act introduced today, April 11.

A key amendment sets a non-renewable seven-year term for the director of Public Prosecutions. The term for the deputy director will be five years, with opportunity for one renewal of up to five years.

“These changes strengthen the appointment process for senior leadership at the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service,” said Brad Johns, Minister of Justice and Attorney General. “They will allow for ongoing renewal, new ideas and the opportunity for increased diversity at the most senior levels of our province’s justice system while respecting the prosecutorial independence of the Public Prosecution Service.”

Other changes to the act include:
-- clarifying that the Attorney General is responsible for recommending the proposed appointees for the director and deputy director to the governor in council
-- specifying that the appointee to the deputy director position must be from within the Nova Scotia public service and be a barrister of at least 10 years standing; these changes will take effect when the next deputy director is appointed.

Appointments will apply the Public Service Commission’s fair hiring policy, which requires adherence to important principles of equity, diversity and inclusion.

Quick Facts:
--the PPS prosecutes charges under the Criminal Code and Nova Scotia statutes and handles 40,000 charges annually 
-- established in 1990, it is the first statutorily based independent prosecution service in Canada
-- currently, there is no term limit for the director of the PPS; the change to a seven-year term appointment for is consistent with other jurisdictions with independent prosecution services
-- recruitment for a new director is underway
-- currently, there is no term limit for the deputy director and that position is appointed by the director

"Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Legislation to Improve Registration System for Short-term Rentals","COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE--Legislation to Improve Registration System for Short-term Rentals
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, April 11, will help provide a more comprehensive picture of short-term rentals in the province by requiring all operators to register with the Tourist Accommodation Registry.

“Ensuring registration requirements apply to all tourism accommodations will help create a level playing field for operators and give municipalities a more accurate picture of short-term rentals in their communities,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “Tourism is a vital part of our economy and having a variety of accommodations helps attract travellers, but we need to balance short-term rentals with meeting local housing needs.”

The Tourist Accommodation Registration Act, passed in 2019, requires short-term rentals to register with the Province annually, except if they are operated in or attached to the host’s primary residence. Removing the primary residence exemption will provide clearer data about short-term rentals and help municipalities identify short-term rentals in their communities to improve enforcement of bylaws.

This new reporting requirement also means municipalities do not need to establish their own reporting systems.

Once the amendments have passed, regulations will also be developed to support enforcement of the act and to make compliance with municipal zoning and bylaws a requirement of registration.

Quotes:
“The last two years have been devastating for the tourism industry, and accommodation operators have been hit particularly hard. We’re pleased to see these amendments to the Tourist Accommodation Registration Act, which will help create a level playing field for all accommodation types by ensuring short-term rentals are subject to the same rules as other operators. TIANS strongly commends the government’s action on enhancing the current legislation as we begin rebuilding Nova Scotia’s crucial tourism economy.”
     - Darlene Grant Fiander, President, Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- the Tourist Accommodations Registration Act came into effect in April 2020
-- roofed accommodations must register to operate in Nova Scotia if they provide accommodations for 28 days or less
-- primary residence is defined as the home where someone lives as an owner or tenant; it’s also the address used for bills, identification, taxes and insurance

"Premier's Office / COVID - 19 / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Paid Sick Leave Program Extended Until May 7","COVID-19/PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Paid Sick Leave Program Extended Until May 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program will be extended until May 7, 2022, the same date that Canada’s Sickness Recovery Benefit will end. Program requirements for Nova Scotia’s voluntary program will not change.

“Nova Scotians know how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at work, and we’re happy to support them in making the right decisions,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We continue to listen to Nova Scotians and remain focused on keeping workplaces safe. Extending the program supports this objective.”

The program had been scheduled to end March 31. The extension means that sick days between April 1 and May 7 may be eligible for reimbursement.

Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program is open to employers and self-employed workers and covers wages for employees and self-employed workers, up to a maximum of $20 per hour or $160 per day. The maximum payment is $640 per worker. Nova Scotians who have already received the maximum payment since the program relaunched in December are not eligible for additional paid sick days during the extended period.

People who miss less than 50 per cent of their scheduled work time in a one-week period (for example, 15 hours or less in a scheduled 32-hour work week) can apply if they need to self-isolate due to exposure, close contact, or because they are experiencing symptoms and getting tested. They may also qualify if they are going to a vaccine or booster appointment.

Eligible businesses that continue to pay their employees during their leave, and self-employed workers who miss time, may be reimbursed as quickly as five business days from their application.

“I am actively engaged in conversations with labour ministers across Canada about a permanent paid sick leave program,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “In the meantime, while COVID is still very active in our communities, we want to make sure Nova Scotians can access this temporary program, which people have told us has been helpful in keeping COVID out of the workplace.”

Nova Scotia’s program complements the federal Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, which is available to employees and self-employed workers who have missed 50 per cent or more of their scheduled work week as a result of COVID-19.

Quick Facts:
-- the program first launched May 26, 2021, and covered sick days from May 10 to July 31, 2021
-- during that period, about $600,000 was paid out to Nova Scotians and 4,000 sick days were covered; the total program cost, including administration, was just under $1 million

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is providing a one-time investment of $100,000 to the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Society to expand their peer-support training to more young people.

Forty teenagers and young adults will participate in the Peer Outreach Support Services and Education (POSSE) Project, a youth-driven, harm reduction, peer training and outreach program for people ages 15 to 30.

Participants will receive training to become peer outreach workers in their community. Once trained, they can provide non-judgmental, harm reduction support and education to their peers who may be dealing with violence, homelessness, substance use or sexualized violence.

“It is critical that those dealing with mental health and addiction challenges are met with support in a familiar and welcoming way, particularly for youth who are often less likely to reach out for help,” said Hants West MLA Melissa Sheehy-Richard, on behalf of Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “I am grateful Kimm Kent, founder of the POSSE Project, and her staff have such a strong commitment to community and the youth they work with.”

Youth in the program are trained in mental-health first aid, suicide intervention training, non-violent crisis intervention, first aid, and healthy relationships.

Funding will also assist in the hiring of two outreach and support workers, including an Indigenous support worker, to help provide wraparound support to youth experiencing multiple barriers. These wraparound supports include accompaniment to appointments, service navigation, and crisis, suicide, sexual and criminal exploitation prevention and intervention.

Quotes:
“The Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Society would like to acknowledge the Province's commitment to ensuring that marginalized youth are not forgotten. The work of POSSE is one of the many programs and services the province has supported, and we are deeply thankful for the ongoing support for such programs.”
     - Pamela Glode-Desrochers, Executive Director, Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Society

“This funding is a much-needed response to the mental health crisis and substance use challenges youth are experiencing, especially in rural Nova Scotia. Through this funding support, POSSE will increase the capacity of youth to support their peers in crisis. Peer outreach is a recognized best practice in prevention and early intervention strategies for harder to reach populations”
     - Kimm Kent, co-founder, Project Executive, POSSE

“The POSSE Project provides at-risk youth with a safe space to talk and to feel their emotions. I started as a volunteer with the POSSE project three years ago. POSSE has given me the gift of community and a sense of belonging. The skills I have learned helped me help my peers through hardship, and support friends who are experiencing homelessness, or who use substances, and prevent substance poisonings. I am now employed full time as an Indigenous outreach support worker. I cannot put into words the way POSSE changed my life for the good. To be able to provide youth with the same experience I had is an honour.”
     - Mallory Hookey, Indigenous outreach support worker and former POSSE Project youth participant

Quick Facts:
-- POSSE Project operates in the communities of Sipekne’katik First Nation and area, Lower Sackville area, and Windsor-West Hants

The Province has launched a study to determine the extent of the need for affordable housing in Nova Scotia.

Turner Drake & Partners Ltd. has been awarded a $406,310 contract to study housing needs in Nova Scotia’s 49 municipalities. The company will assess current and future housing needs in urban and rural areas, help identify the number of households that currently lack safe, affordable housing for various reasons, and propose solutions.

“We know we need to increase housing supply to meet demand in Nova Scotia. We also need reliable, up-to-date information about where and what the needs are so the Province and municipalities can make smart policy decisions,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “This study will give us that data and takes action on the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission recommendation to improve the information available on the rental housing market in Nova Scotia.”

The study will also include a needs assessment for post-secondary student housing in communities with at least one university or college campus.

As part of this housing needs assessment, Turner Drake will engage with municipalities and other key stakeholders over the coming months. The company will share early data with the Province as it becomes available, and the final report is expected in one year.

The Province has also awarded a contract to Akoma Holdings to complete a housing needs assessment for African Nova Scotian communities. This will include an analysis of environmental racism and systemic barriers to finding housing. The information gathered from the assessment will assist in developing a housing strategy for African Nova Scotian communities.

Quotes:
“Good decisions are a result of the collection and use of good data. We are pleased the Province is moving forward with the crucial data collection that is needed to plan for sustainable and affordable housing in our communities.”
     - Amanda McDougall, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities

“For too long, Black Nova Scotians have faced housing issues due to systemic racism. From fractured land titles to basic infrastructure, our community has been overlooked and bypassed in the housing market and now crisis. Partnering with the African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition and vested community members, AKOMA is proud to be part of this initiative to break down these barriers and build up Black families.”
     - Veronica Marsman, Property Manager, Akoma Holdings Inc.

“The issues with affordable housing are complex. While an overarching understanding of the issues is important, each municipality and region is unique. I’m pleased that the Province is leading this vital initiative.”
     - Carolyn Bolivar-Getson, Mayor, Municipality of the District of Lunenburg

Quick Facts:
-- in 2021-22, the Province invested more than $35 million to create over 1,100 new affordable housing units across the province, including 425 rent supplements
-- Budget 2022-23 contains $15 million more for affordable housing programs and funding for 550 new rent supplements
-- the Province now offers more than 5,500 rent supplements every month to help Nova Scotians with the cost of rent

NOTE: A list of grant recipients follows this release.

The Province is providing one-time grants totalling $396,000 to support 20 community transportation providers across Nova Scotia.

“These organizations offer full-service transportation to meet the daily needs of Nova Scotians, particularly in rural communities,” said Kim Masland, Minister of Public Works. “This funding recognizes the financial pressures these organizations have faced, with increases in fuel, insurance and vehicle maintenance costs.”

Reliable community transportation allows people to access services, including going to work, shopping, attending medical appointments and participating in activities in their community.

Quotes:
“COVID-19 has put considerable financial strain on the community transit providers over the past two years. Throughout the pandemic we have continued to provide transportation services to our clients to get them where they needed to go. The cost of fuel and maintenance alone have seen a steady increase in pricing, which has impacted our financial bottom lines and created challenges in providing service. These funds are greatly appreciated to help with these ever-increasing expenses.”

"Finance and Treasury Board","Financial Measures (2022) Act Introduced","FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD--Financial Measures (2022) Act Introduced
----------------------------------------------------------------
Finance and Treasury Board Minister Allan MacMaster introduced the Financial Measures (2022) Act today, April 8, implementing amendments and key tax measures from Budget 2022-23: Solutions for Healthcare, Solutions for Nova Scotians.

“Budget 2022-23 makes investments in the areas Nova Scotians care about most, including new tax measures to address our housing crisis, strategically grow our population and economy, address labour shortages, and invest in our families and communities,” said Minister MacMaster. “We are taking action on the priorities of Nova Scotians and the Financial Measures Act follows through on our commitments.”

The proposed act will establish:
-- a Children’s Sports and Arts Tax Credit, which will help parents or legal guardians offset the costs of their child’s registration and expenses in sports and arts programs
-- the More Opportunities for Skilled Trades program, which will return personal provincial income tax paid on the first $50,000 of earnings for eligible people under the age of 30 in sectors where there are identified labour shortages
-- a Non-resident Deed Transfer and Property Taxes Act, which will help make housing more available and attainable for Nova Scotia residents.

Additional amendments include:
-- clarifying language in the Canada Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act about appointments to dispute resolution panels
-- amending the Members’ Retirement Allowance Act to align language with the federal Income Tax Act.

Quick Facts:
-- the Financial Measures (2022) Act provides the legislative authority to implement measures that have financial consequences and is a routine part of the budget process
-- the Children’s Sports and Arts Refundable Tax Credit is estimated to cost $4.7 million in 2022-23
-- the More Opportunities for Skilled Trades program has no financial impact for the 2022-23 fiscal year
-- non-resident deed transfer and property taxes are estimated to generate $81 million in revenue in 2022-23
-- Budget 2022-23 estimates a deficit of $506.2 million with revenues of $12.7 billion and consolidated expenses of $13.2 billion

-------------------------------------------------------------
Le rapport épidémiologique de cette semaine sur la COVID-19 montre une augmentation continue des résultats positifs des tests analysés en laboratoire en raison des variants Omicron et BA.2, qui sont extrêmement contagieux et transmissibles. Le nombre d'hospitalisations attribuables à la COVID-19 augmente aussi. Par contre, le risque de maladie grave est toujours plus faible que dans les vagues précédentes.

« La COVID-19 circule dans toutes les collectivités de la province, mais grâce au taux de vaccination élevé dans la province, le nombre d'hospitalisations et de décès reste faible proportionnellement au nombre total de cas positifs, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Il ne faut pas oublier que la pandémie n'est pas terminée. La façon la plus efficace de minimiser votre risque et le risque pour les autres est de porter un masque, de limiter vos rassemblements sociaux, de rester à la maison si vous êtes malade, de vous couvrir la bouche pour tousser et de vous laver les mains. »

Pour la semaine se terminant le 6 avril :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 6 991 ont donné un résultat positif. 
-- Soixante et une nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées et 32 ont obtenu leur congé.
-- Au 6 avril, 57 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et l'âge médian est de 72 ans.
-- De ce nombre, 15,8 % ne sont pas vaccinées ou n'ont reçu qu'une seule dose du vaccin.
-- Durant cette même période, huit décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 depuis le début de la vague Omicron (le 8 décembre 2021) est de 79 ans, et 27,2 % de ces personnes n'étaient pas vaccinées ou n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose du vaccin.
-- Au 6 avril, 87,5 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse avaient reçu au moins deux doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19, 4,9 % avaient reçu une seule dose et 7,6 % n'étaient pas vaccinées. 

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 préparé pour le Dr Strang et son équipe afin d'éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie est maintenant à la disposition du public. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés. Le rapport sera affiché chaque semaine dans le site Web du gouvernement sur le coronavirus.

-------------------------------------------------------------
This week’s COVID-19 epidemiologic report shows a continued increase in positive lab tests as a result of the highly infectious and transmissible Omicron and BA.2 variants. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are also increasing. However, the risk of severe illness continues to be lower than in previous waves.

“COVID-19 is circulating in all communities across the province but given Nova Scotia has a highly vaccinated population, the number of hospitalizations and deaths as a proportion of total positive tests remains low,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We need to remember this pandemic is not over – the most effective strategy to minimize your risk and the risk to others includes masking, small and consistent social circles and gatherings, staying home when you’re sick, and practicing good cough etiquette and hand hygiene.”

For the one-week period ending April 6:
-- there were 6,991 positive PCR tests performed at the lab
-- there were 61 new hospital admissions due to COVID-19 and 32 discharges
-- as of April 6, there were 57 people in hospital for COVID-19, with a median age of 72
-- of the current hospitalizations, 15.8 per cent of people are unvaccinated or have had one dose of vaccine
-- there were eight COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system, during this period
-- the median age of COVID-19 reported deaths since the start of the Omicron wave (December 8, 2021) is 79, and 27.2 per cent of people were unvaccinated or had one dose of vaccine
-- as of April 6, 87.5 per cent of Nova Scotians had two or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 4.9 per cent had one dose, and 7.6 per cent were unvaccinated.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary prepared for Dr. Strang and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic is available to the public. The report tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. It will be posted weekly on the government’s coronavirus website.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Les résidents des établissements de soins de longue durée et les personnes de 70 ou plus en Nouvelle-Écosse pourront bientôt prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir une deuxième dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

La décision d'offrir une deuxième dose de rappel est basée sur les lignes directrices mises à jour publiées cette semaine par le Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation.  Des renseignements supplémentaires sur la deuxième dose de rappel seront disponibles la semaine prochaine.

« On ne peut trop insister sur l'importance des vaccins, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La plupart des adultes obtiendront la protection maximale après trois doses du vaccin, soit une série primaire de deux doses suivie d'une dose de rappel. Toutefois, les recherches démontrent que la protection contre des symptômes graves diminue au fil du temps chez les personnes à risque plus élevé en raison de leur âge. Une deuxième dose de rappel est maintenant recommandée pour les personnes de 70 ans ou plus. En obtenant toutes les doses recommandées selon votre groupe d'âge et votre état de santé, non seulement vous vous protégez contre des symptômes graves, mais vous protégez également les gens qui vous entourent. »

Les personnes de 70 ou plus peuvent maintenant recevoir une dose de rappel 120 jours après leur série primaire ou leur première dose de rappel. Les personnes de moins de 70 ans qui sont admissibles à recevoir leur première dose de rappel peuvent la recevoir 168 jours après leur série primaire.

Une mise à jour est également offerte, aujourd'hui 7 avril, sur la disponibilité d'un nouveau vaccin, sur les trousses de dépistage rapide et sur le programme de dépistage en milieu de travail :

Vaccin Novavax

La Province a commencé à recevoir le vaccin Novavax, qui sera offert aux adultes de 18 ans ou plus à titre de première ou deuxième dose et à titre de dose de rappel à certains endroits à compter du vendredi 8 avril. Le vaccin Novavax peut être utilisé pour les trois doses ou avec d'autres vaccins approuvés dans le cadre d'une série combinée.

Trousses de dépistage rapide

On encourage les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à se procurer des trousses de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 et à les garder à la maison pour pouvoir les utiliser dès l'apparition de symptômes, lorsqu'un membre du ménage obtient un résultat positif, et comme façon de protéger les autres, par exemple avant de rencontrer une personne à risque élevé de souffrir d'un cas grave de COVID-19.

Des trousses de dépistage rapide sont maintenant offertes aux endroits suivants : 
-- Bureaux des députés
-- Bibliothèques publiques à l'échelle de la province
-- Cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide; les emplacements de ces cliniques se trouvent sur le site Web de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse : https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing (en anglais seulement)
-- Centres Accès Nouvelle-Écosse; les personnes qui se présentent pour obtenir un service pourront également recevoir une trousse de tests rapides

Une limite d'une trousse par ménage s'applique à tous les emplacements.  Chaque trousse contient cinq tests.

Un nouveau partenariat avec Feed Nova Scotia permettra également d'offrir des trousses de dépistage aux personnes qui utilisent les programmes et les services de certaines banques alimentaires.

Des trousses de dépistage rapide seront toujours fournies aux élèves et au personnel des écoles publiques, au besoin.

Programme de dépistage en milieu de travail

Le gouvernement a apporté des changements au programme de dépistage en milieu de travail afin de mettre l'accent sur les environnements à risque élevé, par exemple les établissements de soins de longue durée ou de soins actifs, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et les foyers de groupe.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Long-term care residents and adults 70 and older in Nova Scotia will soon be able to book a second booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

The decision to make a second booster available is based on updated guidelines released this week by the National Advisory Council on Immunization. More details on the Province’s rollout of second booster doses will be shared next week.

“The importance of vaccines cannot be overstated,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Most adults will get maximum protection from three doses of vaccine – that is, a two-dose primary series plus one booster. However, evidence has shown some weakening in protection against severe disease over time for those at highest risk due to age. A second booster is now recommended for those over the age of 70. By getting all the available doses recommended for your age group and health status, you are not only protecting yourself from severe disease, you’re protecting the people around you, too.”

People who are 70 and older can receive a booster dose 120 days following their primary series or their first booster dose. People under the age of 70 and who are eligible for their first booster dose can receive it 168 days following the primary series.

There are also updates today, April 7, on the availability of another vaccine, rapid test kits and the workplace screening program:

Novavax vaccine

The Novavax vaccine has started arriving in the province and will be available for adults 18 and older as a first, second or third (booster) dose at select locations beginning Friday, April 8. Novavax can be used for all three doses, or as part of a mixed series with other approved vaccines.

Rapid testing kits

Nova Scotians are encouraged to keep COVID-19 rapid testing kits at home and use them any time they have symptoms, when someone else in their house tests positive, and as a way to protect others – like before gathering with someone at high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19.

People can now pick up free rapid testing kits at the following locations:
-- MLA offices
-- public libraries across the province
-- pop-up testing sites; current pop-up locations can be found on Nova Scotia Health Authority’s website: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing
-- Access Nova Scotia locations; people going in for services will also be offered a package of rapid tests.

At all locations, there is a limit of one box per household member per visit. Each box contains five tests.

There is also a new partnership with Feed Nova Scotia that will provide testing kits to people accessing programs and services at some food banks.

Rapid testing kits will continue to be provided to students and staff at public schools as needed.

Workplace screening program

The government has made changes to its workplace screening program to focus on high-risk settings, like long-term care, acute care, corrections, shelters, and group homes.

"L'nu Affairs","Legislation Enshrines Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s First Language","L’NU AFFAIRS--Legislation Enshrines Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s First Language 
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The Mi’kmaw translation of the news release follows
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, April 7, recognizes Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s first language and will support efforts to preserve and promote it now and for future generations.

The Mi’kmaw Language Act commits the Province to working closely with Mi’kmaw communities and organizations such as Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey to develop a language revitalization strategy.

“This legislation was created in partnership with the Mi’kmaq and further commits government to helping protect and revitalize the Mi’kmaw language,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of L’nu Affairs. “The work we will continue to do together in the coming months will create a plan to move forward. Our government sees this is a critical step on the path toward reconciliation.”

The bill establishes a joint committee that will develop a multi-year strategy that identifies priorities and includes steps to reclaim and revitalize the Mi’kmaw language.

The legislation will be proclaimed on a mutually agreeable date with Mi’kmaw leadership, and it will take effect on October 1, Treaty Day.

Quotes:
“I am very excited about this legislation today. It is a big first step but there is still a lot of work to be done. I am eagerly looking forward to working with our elders, knowledge keepers, language warriors, and the Province in the joint implementation of this legislation. It is my hope that the model we create can be used nationally.”
     - Chief Leroy Denny, Eskasoni First Nation, Chair, Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey

“We are seeing language loss in our communities but most importantly we are seeing a language resurgence in communities where youth and community people are actively in pursuit of restoring their language and culture. This legislation will help strengthen that.”
     - Blaire Gould, Executive Director, Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey

“Without our language, we cannot pass along what our Elders are really teaching us.”
     - Elder Albert Marshall, Eskasoni First Nation

Quick Facts:
-- the legislation reinforces the importance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action for governments to preserve, promote, revitalize and protect Aboriginal languages through legislation and education
-- the Mi’kmaw Language Act aligns with Nova Scotia’s collaborative work with the Mi’kmaq to respond to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Calls for Justice, to ensure meaningful access to language, culture, and identity as a foundation for resilience and safety
-- in 2019, a Mi’kmaw Language Task Team, represented by the Province and Mi’kmaq, engaged all Mi’kmaw communities and the Mi’kmaq Native Friendship Centre to create the Mi’kmaw Language Initiative – Nova Scotia Mi’kmaq Community Engagement Sessions Report 2019
-- that report recommends that the protection of language be facilitated by legislation
-- by 2027, if current trends continue, children aged four and younger will not be able to speak Mi’kmaq; the number of children under age four learning Mi’kmaq decreased from 44 per cent in 1999 to just 20 per cent in 2013

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Amendments to Electricity Act, Public Utilities Act","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Amendments to Electricity Act, Public Utilities Act
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is bringing forward promised legislative changes that will protect solar homeowners and small businesses in the solar industry. Other amendments will push Nova Scotia Power to ensure that ratepayers have reliable, cleaner power and further hold the utility accountable for how it delivers electricity.

The measures are in amendments introduced today, April 7, to the Electricity Act and the Public Utilities Act. They are designed to improve Nova Scotia Power’s net-metering program, support the solar energy industry in Nova Scotia and improve the Community Solar and Green Choice programs.

“The amendments we’re introducing today support Nova Scotia ratepayers by empowering them to join our fight against climate change and adopt renewable sources of energy, and holding Nova Scotia Power to a higher standard of performance,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “Making changes in support of a thriving solar industry will help us in our goal of generating 80 per cent of our electricity through renewables by 2030.”

Amendments to the Electricity Act will ensure Nova Scotians can generate their own renewable power, such as with solar panels, and gain more control of their energy use:
-- ratepayers will be guaranteed the full right to net meter without fear of new special charges, fees or rates – Nova Scotia Power will be prohibited from adding such charges
-- ratepayers will be guaranteed the right to bring the energy portion of their electricity bill to $0 annually if they are able to generate enough power from renewable sources like solar panels
-- the Province’s Green Choice Program will be simplified and offer more opportunities for large-scale consumers to use renewable energy
- the Community Solar Program (formerly the Shared Solar Program) will be simplified and Nova Scotia Power’s role in it will be limited
-- within 12 months, Nova Scotia Power will be required to fully implement the Green Button standard, which enables customers to securely download their household or business electricity usage data and connect their data to online apps to help cut their bills.

Amendments to the Public Utilities Act will strengthen performance standards that Nova Scotia Power must meet, including:
-- adding more performance standards for things like reliability and outage response times
-- enabling stakeholders and advocates to be a part of the oversight and accountability of Nova Scotia Power by creating a new partnership and performance table to provide advice to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board on performance standards and penalties.

The bill also allows farmers markets to pay the domestic electricity rate to help lower their power bills.

Quick Facts:
-- the Green Choice Program will offer a new, simplified process for large-scale energy customers to procure renewable electricity and is set to launch later this year
-- net metering provides ratepayers the ability to offset their electricity usage by generating and using energy from small-scale renewable energy projects, such as solar panels

"Justice / Public Works","Amendments Strengthen Boat Harbour Act","JUSTICE/PUBLIC WORKS--Amendments Strengthen Boat Harbour Act
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, April 7, clarifies a section of the Boat Harbour Act that prohibits legal claims against the Province for the closure of the Boat Harbour effluent treatment facility.

Sec. 4(1) of the act, which was passed in 2015, currently states that “no action” can be taken against the Province. With the proposed amendment, it would state: “No action, including action for damages or any other compensation…” This new language further strengthens the prohibition against legal action and is consistent with the original intent of the legislation.

“The Boat Harbour Act is an important piece of legislation that protects the environment. It also prevents legal action against the Province. Adding clearer language in the legislation makes our intention very clear,” said Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “The Province has an obligation to protect the interests of Nova Scotia taxpayers. This legislation achieves that.”

The amendment will be retroactive to the date the act was enacted, May 11, 2015.

Quick Facts:
-- the Boat Harbour effluent treatment facility was closed on January 31, 2020, as specified in the Boat Harbour Act
-- remediation plans are underway to restore the site to its original state as a tidal estuary
-- the Province is investing $310 million in the cleanup
-- Northern Pulp has submitted a new effluent treatment facility project for a provincial Class II environmental assessment

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Amendments to Halifax Regional Municipality Charter Support Quicker Housing Development Approvals","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Amendments to Halifax Regional Municipality Charter Support Quicker Housing Development Approvals
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is proposing amendments to the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) Charter to help streamline, improve and shorten the approval process for residential housing developments.

The changes will modernize aspects of the development process, clarify approval processes, remove duplication of public engagement, adjust the timing of some development costs to align with the completion of development, and improve develop agreement authorities.

“The Halifax region needs more housing stock and more affordable units as soon as possible,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “By removing unnecessary regulatory barriers and processes, we will help ensure the approval process moves more quickly so we are able to increase the housing supply.”

These proposed changes were brought forward by the HRM Housing Task Force.

Quotes:
“We have been working in partnership with HRM to identify ways to accelerate stalled developments. They have highlighted several challenging legislative and policy areas in which the province has jurisdiction. It only makes sense to modernize the rules that impact their ability to move projects forward.”
     - Geoff MacLellan, Chair, HRM Housing Task Force

Quick Facts:
-- the task force was appointed on November 25, 2021, and since December, it has met with 31 developers, industry representatives and community agencies and 41 potential developments have been brought before the panel for consideration
-- the Province designated nine special planning areas last month, allowing the Minister to assume authority for development approvals in those areas
-- a $2.3-million investment was announced recently to enable the municipality to conduct critical environmental, land-use suitability, transportation and infrastructure studies
-- a $22-million investment to create more than 370 affordable housing units in Dartmouth was announced last week
-- in November, a $6.4-million investment was made to build about 200 new affordable rental units in Kentville, Lantz, Halifax and Cole Harbour

"Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services","Legislation to Permanently Allow Virtual and Hybrid Meetings","SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES--Legislation to Permanently Allow Virtual and Hybrid Meetings 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, April 6, will give provincially regulated companies, co-operatives, societies and condominium corporations the option to continue meeting virtually or with a mix of in-person and virtual participants.

An Act to Permit Virtual Business Meetings makes amendments to the Companies Act, Co-operative Associations Act, Societies Act and the Condominiums Act and will impact corporate bodies that are formed under them.

“The pandemic has challenged companies and other corporate bodies to look at innovative ways to continue to do essential business while following public health guidelines,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “The proposed amendments respond to their request to permanently allow the option to hold virtual or hybrid meetings as they have demonstrated they can do so effectively and responsibly.”

Provincially regulated companies, co-operatives, societies, condominiums and other corporate bodies were allowed to hold virtual and hybrid meetings during the provincial state of emergency, which ended last month. The amendments will allow these options on a permanent basis.

The proposed legislation will also set parameters around holding virtual and hybrid meetings, while providing flexibility around how meetings are held.

Quotes:
“We are pleased that the opportunity to continue to hold virtual meetings through electronic means will be maintained. The pandemic required many changes for all of us, and in this instance, we’ve found one that can help non-profits engage more of their membership in regular meetings and reduce the travel and financial burden on our volunteers.”
    - Jamie Ferguson, CEO, Sport Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness estimates these changes will save businesses about $4 million annually and 468,000 hours of time, mostly related to travel that will no longer be required
-- over 55,000 entities will benefit from the amendments 
-- the Companies Act, Co-operative Associations Act, Societies Act and the Condominium Act govern the vast majority of entities that are required to hold regular shareholder, member and director meetings

"Health and Wellness","New, Powerful MRIs for Halifax Infirmary","HEALTH/WELLNESS--New, Powerful MRIs for Halifax Infirmary
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is replacing an important piece of diagnostic equipment at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax to ensure Nova Scotians get the best care.

A new, high-power magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner will be installed at the Halifax Infirmary. The $16.5-million investment will also build a new diagnostic suite at the hospital for its three MRI scanners.

“Nova Scotians deserve access to high-quality, modern healthcare and this includes having the best equipment needed for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning,"" said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “These MRIs will ensure care at the Infirmary will be state of the art.”

The government also announced a $5.1-millon investment in December for a new medium-power MRI. The two MRIs are due for replacement, and the new scanners will be more reliable and efficient. The cost for the MRIs is $6.3 million while the work on the new diagnostic imaging suite is about $12.3 million. The total project cost is $21.6 million.

The Infirmary also has a low-power MRI.

MRI scanners use powerful magnets and computers that take detailed pictures of internal organs and systems inside the body. These pictures are necessary for clinicians to make important decisions about treatment.

Work on the diagnostic suite and installation of the new units will begin later this year.

"Public Works","Amendments to Motor Carrier Act","PUBLIC WORKS--Amendments to Motor Carrier Act
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the Motor Carrier Act introduced today, April 5, will help reduce the regulatory burden and enhance safety in the motor carrier industry.

“The amendments we are introducing today will give government more flexibility to respond to the industry’s ever-changing needs,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “They allow government to waive motor carrier fees in challenging times like during the pandemic and adopt federal changes to the motor carrier sector.”

In 2020 and 2021, the government waived the annual motor carrier fee in principle, but it requires a change to the Motor Carrier Act for implementation. The amendment will enable the legislative authority to waive fees, if needed.

The second amendment will make it easier for the government to change regulations by referencing other acts, regulations or other documents. This will help ensure consistency and accuracy in the motor carrier industry across jurisdictions, such as with electronic logging devices that are required across the country.

Quick Facts:
-- motor carriers are commercial passenger vehicles that includes buses and vans
-- the motor carrier industry had been asking for mandatory electronic logging devices
-- the devices automatically log distance driven, engine run-time and other trackable data, reducing the burden on drivers to log their data by hand
-- the devices have been shown to increase compliance with federal laws

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act will permit the safe operation of electric kick scooters (e-scooters) on municipal roadways.

Changes introduced today, April 5, set the minimum age, maximum speed and other requirements in legislation and will allow municipalities to create bylaws related to where people can operate e-scooters and other rules for their use.

“We support and encourage the safe use of alternative transportation options that are low cost, energy efficient and convenient,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “When it comes to e-scooters, it makes sense for municipalities to set the rules for their use in their communities. There is growing interest in e-scooters, and we are putting general rules in place to keep everyone safe.”

The proposed amendments include a minimum age of 14 to use e-scooters, a maximum permitted speed of 32 km/h, helmet requirements and other operation restrictions. Municipalities will have the discretion to set a lower speed limit, as well as decide if e-scooters will be permitted on roads, sidewalks or shared sidewalks.

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia's Motor Vehicle Act is being replaced with a new, modern Traffic Safety Act that will help make the province’s roads and highways safer
-- the Traffic Safety Act is undergoing extensive consultation and is expected to take about three years to be proclaimed
-- before the Traffic Safety Act is proclaimed, time-sensitive amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act will allow important projects and initiatives to move forward

"Justice","Amendments to Powers of Attorney Act","JUSTICE--Amendments to Powers of Attorney Act 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, April 5, offers additional safeguards to prevent abuse of those who appoint another person to manage their affairs under a power of attorney. 

“When doing estate planning, people should have peace of mind and trust that their wishes will be carried out as they intended,” said Justice Minister Brad Johns. “We are making changes to ensure the actions of those appointed as power of attorney are more transparent so that others can intervene if problems like misuse or financial abuse arise.”  

Powers of attorney are important advance planning tools for adults who wish to appoint someone they trust to make decisions for them respecting their property and finances temporarily or if they become permanently incapable of making those decisions. 

The changes will improve and modernize the legislation. They will clarify the rights and responsibilities of all individuals and add additional safeguards to protect those who choose to use powers of attorney.

They include: 
-- new requirements for the valid execution of a power of attorney, including that it be in writing, dated and witnessed by two people;
-- incorporating modern concepts of capacity, including an outline of the required approach to decision-making;
-- outlining the donor’s rights and protections, including new safeguards such as the option to appoint a monitor to whom the attorney must also report periodically and upon request.

The government will continue to review the act for potential future changes.

The amendments will come into effect upon proclamation.

Quotes: 
“Any kind of abuse is completely unacceptable, and we know that financial abuse is a serious concern for many older Nova Scotians. The amendments introduced today will deliver peace of mind for seniors and ensure they have the dignity and respect they have earned.”
     - Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care 

“The Canadian Association of Retired Persons, CARP Nova Scotia, was pleased to be consulted by the government in changes to the Powers of Attorney Act. We have been advocating for some time on behalf of the many seniors of our province.”

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Funding Supports Adoption of Ecological Forestry","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Funding Supports Adoption of Ecological Forestry
----------------------------------------------------------------
Several new projects funded by the Province will help with the adoption of ecological forestry to achieve a sustainable forestry sector in Nova Scotia.

Ecological forestry is a new approach to forestry management that protects ecosystems and biodiversity, supports economic growth and keeps the province’s forests healthy and sustainable.

“Adopting the ecological forestry model is happening now, and its success relies on partnerships with the sector, the science community and our stakeholders,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “These investments will help small, private woodlot owners explore how they can adopt ecological forestry. They will also help us manage species at risk and improve our knowledge for soil nutrient management.”

While the Province adopts ecological forestry on Crown land, the Nova Scotia Woodlot Owners and Operators Association aims to expand voluntary adoption on private woodlands. The association will use $500,000 to explore the barriers and benefits of ecological forestry for private woodlot owners. 

The Department is investing $830,000 for several projects to protect species at risk, working with:
-- Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre to expand information gathering and data management
-- Nova Scotia Invasive Species Council to support enhanced data management and co-ordinated reporting systems
-- Saint Mary’s University to develop mapping and planning tools for lichens that are at risk
-- E.C. Smith Herbarium at Acadia University to support field work for collecting baseline data and monitoring plants and lichens that are at risk.

The Department is also investing $445,000 to establish a Centre for Sustainable Soil Management in partnership with Dalhousie University. It will support expanded research and information sharing about soil nutrient management to ensure harvests do not exceed the soil’s capacity to support regeneration and re-growth.

Quotes:
“This new funding will allow us to test ecologically sensitive alternatives in the full range of management practices that can be used by landowners and foresty professionals in Nova Scotia.” 
     - Andy Kekacs, Executive Director, Nova Scotia Woodlot Owners and Operators Association

Quick Facts:
-- adopting ecological forestry is a recommendation in the independent review of forestry practices in Nova Scotia by Prof. Bill Lahey
-- the triad model of ecological forestry being adopted on Crown land consists of three legs: conservation zones, high production forestry zones and mixed use or matrix zones
-- the three zones work together to allow ecological and economic goals to coexist, leading to healthy forests and a sustainable forestry sector
-- these investments have been made from the 2021-22 budget

The Province is providing Habitat for Humanity Nova Scotia a grant of $203,500 to help make home ownership a reality for 70 families.

The grant will assist with project management, design and other pre-construction costs associated with the organization’s Habitat Way development at Drysdale Road and River Road in Spryfield.

“Owning a home can be life-changing for families,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “When you own a home, you have options and that is a powerful thing. Homeownership can give families the strength and stability they need to build happier and healthier lives.”

Seven families already call the community home. Once complete, Habitat Way will include 77 affordable housing units. Habitat for Humanity provides qualified families the opportunity to purchase a home with no down payment, an interest-free mortgage and monthly payments that never exceed 30 per cent of their household income.

Habitat for Humanity Nova Scotia plans to break ground on Phase 2 of the project later this year and complete the next five homes in 2023.

The provincial government is investing close to $100,000 for three studies to support community transportation.

“We understand the challenges people have in some areas of the province accessing affordable transportation. This is an important investment that supports building stronger rural communities,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “Access to transportation helps people of all ages get around their communities, whether it’s for social activities, employment, health services or education.”

The Municipality of the District of St. Mary’s is receiving $35,000 to develop a business plan exploring options for a new transit service.

Senior Wheels Association of Bridgewater is looking to expand its community transportation service to include the western portion of Lunenburg County. Currently, it provides transportation to seniors and physically disabled people within the Town of Bridgewater and a seven-kilometre radius. The Province is providing $36,000 to fund a business and marketing plan.

Pictou County Transit is looking to expand its service to include the towns of Westville, Trenton and Pictou. The Province is providing $25,000 to study potential routes and costs.

Quotes:
“The municipality is excited to partner with the Nova Scotia Rural Transit Network to assist in the development of a business plan for community transit in St. Mary’s. The project is being led by a management team, consisting of members of Common Good Solutions, Nova Scotia Rural Transit Network, Department of Public Works and St. Mary’s municipal staff. As St. Mary’s is one of only two areas left in the province without a community transit service, the municipality looks forward to exploring the feasibility of a community transit project.”

"Community Services","Applications Open for Sexual Violence Prevention Innovation Grants","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Applications Open for Sexual Violence Prevention Innovation Grants
----------------------------------------------------------------
April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, an opportunity to take an active role in sexual violence prevention, educate about consent, debunk myths and stereotypes and create awareness of the resources available to support victims and survivors.

Beginning today, April 1, applications are open for Sexual Violence Prevention Innovation grants of up to $5,000. The grants support community groups to connect with their peers and build communities that are safer, healthier and more resilient. Groups led by and for youth and/or marginalized Nova Scotians are priorities for funding.

“These grants are a great way to encourage more Nova Scotians to become involved,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “It’s about developing new ideas, being creative and trying new things to prevent sexual violence and raise awareness.”

The deadline for applications is 5 p.m. on May 13.

Quotes:
“Heroes and Adventurers is a safe, inclusive place for people of all ages in Colchester-East Hants to enjoy role-playing games. The grant is helping us develop our own game to provide education about consent. We’re also creating a training module for current and future volunteers and conducting outreach to identify opportunities for our volunteers and players to further learn about consent and sexual assault prevention.”
     - Jon Hutt, Executive Director, Heroes and Adventurers; 2021 grant recipient

Quick Facts:
-- this is the seventh round of applications for Sexual Violence Prevention Innovation grants

"Justice","Legislation Restricts Access to Police Uniforms, Equipment, Vehicles","JUSTICE--Legislation Restricts Access to Police Uniforms, Equipment, Vehicles
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation that will make it more difficult for someone to obtain items to impersonate a police officer will come into effect May 12.

The Police Identity Management Act will prohibit the use, possession, sale or reproduction of police-issued items by or for others. It prohibits the sale of marked police vehicles and restricts possession of police vehicle decals and police vehicle equipment to authorized individuals.

“The dates of April 18 and 19, 2020, will stay in our collective memory for many years to come,” said Brad Johns, Minister of Justice and Attorney General, today, April 1. “By strengthening our laws around the use of police vehicles, uniforms and other articles, we are taking steps to help prevent such tragic events from happening again.”

The legislation will restrict possession of police items to only those authorized to have them, mainly police officers.  The new law will require police agencies in the province to have asset management and disposal policies in place for uniforms, badges, police vehicles, decals and vehicle equipment. This includes a requirement for all retired police vehicles to be decommissioned, with the removal of all equipment, decals and other markings.

Penalties for individuals contravening the act are a fine of up to $10,000 or three months in jail. A corporation found guilty of an offence faces a maximum fine of $25,000. Police can also issue summary offence tickets for violations of the act.

Anyone who has police items to discard should take them to the local RCMP or municipal police department for disposal.

More information on the legislation and how to dispose of police items is available at https://novascotia.ca/restrict-access-police-items-and-vehicles/ or by contacting local municipal police or RCMP.

Quick Facts:
-- the Criminal Code of Canada prohibits impersonation of a police officer
-- in October 2020, the provincial and federal governments established a joint independent public inquiry into the events surrounding the April 2020 mass shooting
-- the Mass Casualty Commission is currently holding public hearings and will make recommendations to the government that could help prevent and respond to similar events in the future

"Agriculture","Legislation to Create Wine Authority for Nova Scotia","AGRICULTURE--Legislation to Create Wine Authority for Nova Scotia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation announced today, April 1, will enable the government to create a wine authority to administer a quality standards program for Nova Scotia wines.

“We are fortunate to have a unique climate and talented winemakers producing world-class products in Nova Scotia,” said Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow. “A wine authority will support the industry’s focus on quality for consumers and help the sector grow and prosper.”

The Nova Scotia Wine Authority Act will set up powers for the authority to establish and monitor a certified program that will align with international standards. The program will help Nova Scotia wines be further recognized in new markets and increase consumer confidence. 

Similar authorities operate in other provinces, including the Ontario Wine Appellation Authority and British Columbia Wine Authority.

Quotes:
“In order for the wine industry in Nova Scotia to continue to grow, evolve, and mature, provincial standards are a necessary step to ensure quality remains at the forefront of our industry. Nova Scotia wine is not only being recognized across Canada but globally as an exciting new wine region, and a wine authority enables the industry to move forward on stronger ground. The wine authority is something the Nova Scotia wine industry has been advocating for and Wine Growers Nova Scotia is looking forward to working with the provincial government on building out that framework.”
     - Haley Brown, Executive Director, Wine Growers of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- the creation of a provincial quality wine standards certification program is one of three initiatives under the Nova Scotia Quality Wine Strategy
-- the other initiatives are a vineyard replanting program and export navigation program

"Justice","Legislation Gives Public Trustee Authority for Unclaimed Remains","JUSTICE--Legislation Gives Public Trustee Authority for Unclaimed Remains
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, April 1, will formally recognize the Public Trustee of Nova Scotia’s authority to manage cases and make final arrangements for a deceased person when the next of kin cannot be identified or take responsibility.

“All Nova Scotians deserve respectful and compassionate arrangements upon their death,” said Brad Johns, Minister of Justice and Attorney General. “Government becomes involved when there are no family members or loved ones to take responsibility for a person’s final arrangements. These changes give clear legislative authority to the Public Trustee to continue this important work.”

Amendments to the Anatomy Act, Public Trustee Act and Fatality Investigations Act will give the Public Trustee the authority to:
-- determine when human remains are unclaimed and assume responsibility for the deceased
-- make and pay for disposition arrangements
-- recover costs from the estate when possible.

The Public Trustee has had responsibility to manage unclaimed remains since a policy change in March 2020. Before that, several government departments had overlapping roles in cases involving unclaimed remains. The policy change was an interim solution until the government made the changes permanent in legislation.

Quotes:
“The Public Trustee is committed to providing respectful arrangement for all people left in hospitals and morgues around the province who have no one to make these arrangements on their behalf.”
     - Shannon Ingraham-Christie, Public Trustee of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- there are about 60 cases of unclaimed remains each year in Nova Scotia
-- the uncremated remains of a deceased person held by an institution such as a morgue or hospital are considered unclaimed when next of kin cannot be identified or cannot take responsibility
-- unclaimed cremated remains in funeral homes are covered under the Embalmers and Funeral Directors Act; most funeral homes have processes in place to address such circumstances

"Finance and Treasury Board / Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services","Amendments Support Restaurants, Allow for Personal Importation of Alcoholic Beverages","FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD/SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES-- Amendments Support Restaurants, Allow for Personal Importation of Alcoholic Beverages
----------------------------------------------------------------
Amendments introduced to the Liquor Control Act today, April 1, are the first step to permanently allow third-party delivery of alcohol with food orders and to enable the direct-to-consumer interprovincial sale of beer and spirits for personal use.

The amendments will come into effect once new regulations are developed.

“Continuing to allow third-party delivery of alcohol with food orders supports our restaurant industry and their employees and gives more options to consumers,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “Those delivering alcohol will be required to complete training to ensure the responsible sale and consumption of alcohol.”

Employees of third-party delivery companies and those working independently who want to deliver alcohol will be required to obtain a delivery licence and take safe-service training. Alcohol orders will be restricted to three times the value of the food ordered, and the minimum fine for illegally providing liquor will also increase to $3,000.

The government is also making an amendment to prepare for an agreement with other provinces and territories that could see alcohol move more freely between provinces. The amendments regarding the direct-to-consumer sale of alcoholic beverages will broaden regulation-making authority that would allow Nova Scotians to buy those products directly from producers outside of Nova Scotia. Amending the Liquor Control Act and preparing regulations means Nova Scotia will be ready if and when a national agreement is reached.

There are ongoing federal and provincial/territorial discussions on eliminating barriers between provinces and territories. An agreement would also allow all Nova Scotian alcoholic beverage producers to sell directly to consumers in other provinces.

“Nova Scotia has a strong and vibrant beer, wine and spirits industry, and they have been vocal advocates for expanding the market for their quality products,” said Allan MacMaster, Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. “We think it is important to show national leadership on this file and hope other provinces will join Nova Scotia in reducing these internal barriers. When they do, we’ll be ready.”

Quotes:
“This amendment will deliver much-needed incremental sales to hard hit restaurateurs, allow us to serve customers better and modernize our legislation to bring them in line with other jurisdictions in Canada.”
     - Luc Erjavec, Vice-President, Atlantic Canada of Restaurants Canada

Quick Facts:
-- starting in May 2021, third-party delivery companies were allowed to deliver alcohol with an order of food while the state of emergency was in effect
-- Nova Scotia made similar direct-to-consumer changes for the personal importation of wine in 2015
-- in 2019, the federal government repealed the last remaining federal restrictions on the sale of alcohol in the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act

-------------------------------------------------------------
Remarque : Les données sur la troisième dose ne sont pas disponibles à cause d’un problème technique.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Le rapport épidémiologique de cette semaine sur la COVID-19 montre une augmentation continue des résultats positifs des tests analysés en laboratoire et des cas liés aux établissements de soins de longue durée et de soins pour bénéficiaires internes. Le nombre d’hospitalisations attribuables à la COVID-19 augmentent aussi. Par contre, le risque de maladie grave est toujours à son point le plus bas durant la vague Omicron que nous traversons maintenant.

« L’augmentation du nombre d’hospitalisations et des résultats positifs au test montre les effets à la fois d’une souche hautement infectieuse de la COVID-19 et de la deuxième phase de notre plan de reprise des activités, a indiqué le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous avons une transmission communautaire plus forte et les gens attrapent le virus, mais le rapport entre les hospitalisations et les décès chez les personnes hospitalisées est demeuré faible – résultat direct de la vaccination. Rien dans ces données ne nous surprend, mais la situation est préoccupante, et elle est un rappel important que la pandémie n’est pas finie et que nous devons faire ce que nous pouvons pour ralentir la propagation du virus. » 

Pour la semaine se terminant le 30 mars :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 4 188 ont donné un résultat positif. 
-- Cinquante-trois nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées et 16 ont obtenu leur congé.
-- Au 30 mars, 51 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et l’âge médian est de 68 ans.
-- De ce nombre, 21,6 % ne sont pas vaccinées ou n’ont reçu qu’une seule dose du vaccin.
-- Durant cette même période, 10 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 depuis le début de la vague Omicron (le 8 décembre 2021) est de 79 ans, et 26,6 % de ces personnes n’étaient pas vaccinées ou n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose du vaccin.
-- Au 30 mars, 87,4 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse avaient reçu au moins deux doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19, 4,9 % avaient reçu une seule dose et 7,7 % n’étaient pas vaccinées. 

Le sommaire épidémiologique hebdomadaire sur la COVID-19 préparé pour le Dr Strang et son équipe pour éclairer les mesures de la Province pour lutter contre la pandémie est maintenant à la disposition du public. Le rapport suit les tendances hebdomadaires et surveille de près les complications graves chez certaines populations clés. Le rapport sera affiché chaque semaine dans le site Web du gouvernement sur le coronavirus.

Le rapport de cette semaine se trouve ici : https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/COVID-19-epidemiologic-summary_2022-03-30.pdf (en anglais seulement)

« Je veux que les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse aient accès aux mêmes renseignements auxquels j’ai accès pour qu’ils puissent les consulter et mieux comprendre la situation actuelle concernant la COVID-19 dans notre province, a ajouté le Dr. Strang. Non seulement le rapport nous aide-t-il à évaluer notre propre risque et à prendre des mesures sensées, mais il nous permet aussi de voir concrètement et en termes bien réels les répercussions de nos gestes – comme la vaccination, le port du masque et les tests de dépistage. »  

Le tableau de bord sur la COVID-19, en ligne depuis janvier 2021, sera mis à jour chaque semaine jusqu’à la fin avril, et il sera ensuite archivé.

NOTE: Data on third vaccine doses is not available because of a technical issue.
-------------------------------------------------------------
This week’s COVID-19 epidemiologic report shows a continued increase in positive lab tests and cases linked to long-term and residential care facilities in Nova Scotia. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are also increasing. However, the risk of severe illness is still lowest during the current Omicron wave.

“The increase in positive tests and hospitalizations shows the impact of both a highly infectious strain of COVID-19 and the second phase of our reopening,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We have more community transmission and people are getting infected with the virus, but the proportion of hospitalizations and deaths among those has remained low – the direct result of vaccination. None of this is unexpected, but it is concerning – and an important reminder that the pandemic is not over, and we need to do what we can to slow the spread.”

For the one-week period ending March 30:
-- there were 4,188 positive PCR tests performed at the lab
-- there were 53 new hospital admissions due to COVID-19 and 16 discharges
-- as of March 30, there were 51 people in hospital for COVID-19 with a median age of 68
-- of the current hospitalizations, 21.6 per cent were unvaccinated or had one dose of vaccine
-- there were 10 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system, during this period
-- the median age of COVID-19 reported deaths since the start of the Omicron wave (December 8, 2021) is 79, and 26.6 per cent of people were unvaccinated or had one dose of vaccine
-- as of March 30, 87.4 per cent of Nova Scotians had two or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 4.9 per cent had one dose, and 7.7 per cent were unvaccinated.

The weekly COVID-19 epidemiologic summary prepared for Dr. Strang and his team to inform the province’s response to the pandemic is now available to the public. The report tracks weekly trends and is focused on monitoring for severe outcomes in key populations. It will be posted weekly on the government’s coronavirus website.

This week’s report can be found here: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/COVID-19-epidemiologic-summary_2022-03-30.pdf

“I want Nova Scotians to have access to the same information as I do so they can see it and better understand the current situation with COVID in our province,” said Dr. Strang. “Not only does it help us assess our own risk and do what makes sense; it also allows us to see first-hand the impact of our actions – like vaccines, masking and testing – in very real terms.”

The COVID-19 dashboard, active since January 2021, will be updated weekly until the end of April, at which point it will be archived.

"Office of Addictions and Mental Health","Legislation Enhances Protections for Patients Admitted for Involuntary Psychiatric Treatment","ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--Legislation Enhances Protections for Patients Admitted for Involuntary Psychiatric Treatment
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, March 31, will enhance the protection of patients treated under the Involuntary Psychiatric Treatment Act.

“These amendments are to protect the best interests and mental health needs of Nova Scotians,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “With these changes, we are enhancing those protections by ensuring that patients continue to receive appropriate mental health treatments while also getting more timely access to legal representation and review hearings.”

The amendments will give the Involuntary Psychiatric Treatment Act review board greater discretion, including the ability to replace a substitute decision-maker who is not acting in the best interest of the patient. The review board will also have the authority to order that a patient be treated in the community rather than in a facility. The addition of a vice-chair will improve the review board’s functioning when the chair is unavailable.
 
Additional changes will ensure that patients and their legal representatives have access to their health file in a timely manner without the need to complete additional paperwork. 
This will increase efficiency and reduce the number of hearings adjourned due to delays in the production of files.
 
The Involuntary Psychiatric Treatment Act was enacted in 2005 to make sure that people who are unable to make treatment decisions due to severe mental illness receive the appropriate treatment. A review of the act was conducted in 2013, resulting in numerous recommendations, including legislative changes.

"Health and Wellness","Amendments to Personal Health Information Act","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Amendments to Personal Health Information Act
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government introduced amendments today, March 31, to the Personal Health Information Act to ensure it remains current and reflects modern practices. 

“We have an obligation to Nova Scotians to protect their personal health information, even in times when that information must be shared to support and improve patient care,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “We are making amendments that will further strengthen the Personal Health Information Act for the benefit of patients across our healthcare system.”

In 2016, the Department initiated a review of the act that involved extensive stakeholder consultation. This review, published in 2018, found the act is achieving the right balance between protecting personal health information and recognizing the needs of those who are required to collect, use and disclose this information to provide or manage healthcare.

The review identified 35 findings, 10 of which required no change. Of the remaining 25, the Province supported 18 for implementation. These 18 recommendations resulted in seven legislative changes and a recognition that some findings would be better addressed through other initiatives.

The seven changes to the act include adding: 
-- a definition of accreditation 
-- a provision to require a substitute decision-maker to act in the best interests of the person for whom they are responsible
-- a new clause to give an authorized person who is conducting an audit or review to collect personal health information without the individual’s consent if the audit is related to the services provided by a custodian
-- a subsection to authorize custodians to audit records to detect privacy breaches 
-- a section to authorize the Minister of Health and Wellness to conduct a review of the act every five years
-- two separate minor language edits to rename subsections. 

Quick Facts: 
-- the Personal Health Information Act was passed in 2010 and came into effect in 2013
-- the act governs the collection, use, disclosure, retention, disposal and destruction of personal health information 
-- section 109 of the act required the department to undertake a comprehensive review within three years of it coming into force; the review was done in 2016

----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, March 31, will amend the Prescription Monitoring Act to reflect proposed changes to the Nova Scotia Prescription Monitoring Board.

In 2005, the Prescription Monitoring Act and its regulations established the Nova Scotia Prescription Monitoring Program to promote the appropriate use of monitored drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines. It aims to reduce the abuse and misuse of these medications by promoting good prescribing practices and informing research activities.

Changes to the act include: 
-- strengthening the Department’s oversight and fiduciary responsibilities
-- increasing the number of public board members from two to four to increase diversity, including those living with chronic pain, people who work in the field and people who have lived experience with drug misuse
-- shifting authority to the Minster of Health and Wellness from governor-in-council for the appointment of non-voting directors and director responsible for licensing
-- minor housekeeping changes

“The governance changes to the Prescription Monitoring Act will help advance our goals of monitoring prescribing practices and ensuring practitioners are accountable for safe and appropriate healthcare delivery,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “We’re doing this by creating a more inclusive, responsive and efficient way to monitor controlled substances in our province.” 

The changes are based on recommendations from the Prescription Monitoring Program Board Strategic Plan and an independent review.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The government introduced an amendment to the Hospitals Act today, March 31, to allow nurse practitioners to admit patients to hospital. 

“Patients deserve a positive healthcare experience from the moment they access care to the moment they can return home,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “Permitting nurse practitioners to admit patients means timely access to care for patients, increased hospital efficiency, and improved movement of patients through their healthcare journey.”

Currently, only physicians, midwives and dentists can admit a patient to hospital. Nurse practitioners can assess, treat and discharge patients, but can’t admit them, even though they are trained and licensed to do so.

Quotes:
“This is good news for Nova Scotians. Amending the Hospitals Act to grant nurse practitioners the authority to admit to hospital optimizes the nurse practitioner scope of practice and will enhance access to care for patients.”
     - Sue Smith, CEO and Registrar, Nova Scotia College of Nursing 

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia joins Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia in allowing nurse practitioners to admit patients to hospital
-- the Hospitals Act was last amended in 2015 to allow nurse practitioners to discharge patients from hospital
-- the Homes for Special Care Act currently authorizes nurse practitioners to admit people to long-term care facilities

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Réduction des frais de garde d'enfants pour les familles","ÉDUCATION ET DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA PETITE ENFANCE-- Réduction des frais de garde d'enfants pour les familles
------------------------------------------------------
Les frais pour les services agréés de garde d'enfants seront réduits de 25 %, en moyenne, à compter du vendredi 1er avril.

Grâce à l'Accord entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada, les parents économiseront de 3 $ à 10,50 $ par jour, par enfant, selon l'âge de l'enfant. 

« Je suis ravie de pouvoir offrir de vraies économies aux familles de la province, affirme Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Il s'agit de la première réduction des frais en vue d'atteindre l'objectif de 10 $ par jour, en moyenne, en 2026, et il s'agit d'un grand pas vers des services de garde d'enfants plus abordables et plus accessibles pour les parents. » 

Les économies seront appliquées directement à la facture des parents. Les centres agréés de garde d'enfants qui acceptent l'entente de financement annuel de 2022-2023 reflétant les principes de l'Accord recevront un financement complet afin de compenser la réduction des frais. Jusqu'à présent, 98 % des exploitants ont signé l'entente, ce qui représente 99 % des places dans les services de garde d'enfants de la province.

La réduction des frais est rétroactive au 1er janvier 2022. Les parents recevront donc un remboursement ou un crédit de leur centre de garde d'enfants pour le montant payé au-delà des nouveaux frais de janvier à mars. Le remboursement ou le crédit devrait être offert aux parents d'ici la fin du mois de mai.  

Les efforts se poursuivent en ce qui a trait à la stratégie de la Nouvelle-Écosse « Excellence dans l'éducation de la petite enfance », qui entraînera une augmentation des salaires et des avantages sociaux pour les éducatrices de la petite enfance dès l'automne.

Le gouvernement du Canada offre un investissement transformateur visant à bâtir un système d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada en collaboration avec ses partenaires provinciaux, territoriaux et autochtones. Presque toutes les provinces et tous les territoires du Canada, y compris la Nouvelle-Écosse, ont annoncé une réduction des frais de garde d'enfants ou offrent déjà des frais moyens de 10 $ par jour ou moins pour les services agréés de garde d'enfants.

« Cette réduction des frais de garde d'enfants est une étape importante vers l'atteinte de l'objectif visant à offrir des frais moyens de 10 $ par jour pour les services agréés d'apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants, ce qui apporte une aide véritable aux familles de toute la province. Nous continuerons à travailler avec le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse pour faire en sorte que les enfants aient accès aux services d'apprentissage et de garde de qualité, abordables et inclusifs dont ils ont besoin pour réussir. »
     - Karina Gould, ministre fédérale de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social

« Cette réduction de 25 % des frais de garde d'enfants me permettra d'économiser un bon montant d'argent chaque mois. Les avantages sont nombreux. J'ai moins d'inquiétudes du point de vue financier, ce qui réduit le stress et me permet d'être un meilleur parent, et les économies nous permettent de faire plus de choses que nous ne pouvions pas nous permettre de faire auparavant comme des voyages en famille, des contributions au REEE de mes enfants et des activités parascolaires. Ces occasions contribuent au développement de mes enfants directement et à long terme. » 
     - Kelly MacDonald, parent de deux jeunes enfants, comté de Cumberland

« Les familles sont au coeur de notre travail et je suis ravie de pouvoir leur offrir des économies considérables, en commençant par 25 %. Pour certaines familles qui utilisent les services du North End Daycare, les frais de garde d'enfants représentent la moitié de leur budget. Cette réduction permettra aux familles d'utiliser cet argent pour d'autres choses au profit de leurs enfants. »  
     - Karen Wright, directrice générale, North End Day Care

Faits en bref
-- La réduction de 25 % est la première étape dans la réduction des frais de garde d'enfants de 50 %, en moyenne, d'ici la fin de l'année 2022, et un pas vers l'atteinte de l'objectif d'offrir des frais moyens de 10 $ par jour d'ici au 31 mars 2026.

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Families Will Pay Less for Child Care","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Families Will Pay Less for Child Care
---------------------------------------------------------
Families will see their fees for accessing licensed, funded child care reduced by 25 per cent, on average, starting Friday, April 1.

Through the Nova Scotia Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, parents will save anywhere between $3 and $10.50 per day, per child, based on the child’s age. 

“I’m incredibly excited to offer real savings to families across the province,” said Becky Druhan, Nova Scotia Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “This is the first fee reduction on our way to achieving $10 a day daycare, on average, for families by 2026 and a major step towards making child care more affordable and accessible for parents.” 

Parents will see the savings applied directly to their bills. Licensed centres that accept the 2022-23 annual funding agreement, which reflects the principles of the Canada-wide agreement, will be provided with full funding to offset the fee reduction. To date, 98 per cent of operators have signed the agreement, representing 99 per cent of child-care spaces in the province.

Reduced fees are applied retroactively to January 1, 2022, meaning parents will receive a cheque or credit from their child-care centre for amounts paid above the new rates from January to March. Parents can expect to see the retroactive funds by the end of May.  

Work continues on Nova Scotia’s Excellence in Early Childhood Education workforce strategy, which will result in higher wages and benefits for early childhood educators by this fall.

The Government of Canada is making a transformative investment to build a Canada-wide early learning and child-care system in partnership with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners. Nearly all of Canada’s provinces and territories, including Nova Scotia, have either announced child-care fee reductions or have already achieved an average cost of $10-a-day or lower for regulated child care.

Quotes:
“This reduction in child-care fees is a meaningful step toward achieving regulated early learning and child care for an average of $10-a-day, making a real difference for families across the province. We will continue to work with the Government of Nova Scotia to help ensure that children have access to the high-quality, affordable, and inclusive early learning and child care they need to succeed.”
     - Karina Gould, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development

“The 25 per cent fee reduction is going to free a large amount of money each month that normally goes towards my daycare bill. The benefits are numerous - less financial worries alleviates stress which allows me to be a better parent, and the extra money allows us more opportunities to do things that we might not have been able to afford before like family trips, savings to contribute to my children's RESP, and extracurricular activities. These opportunities benefit my children's development directly and long-term.” 
     - Kelly MacDonald, parent of two young children, Cumberland County

“Families are at the heart of our work and I’m very excited that we will be able to pass down significant savings, starting with 25 per cent. For some of the families who attend North End Daycare, child-care costs take up to 50 per cent of their budget. This reduction will allow our families to use money for other things that benefit them and their children.”  
     - Karen Wright, Executive Director, North End Day Care

Quick Facts:
-- the 25 per cent reduction is an initial step in reducing child-care fees for Nova Scotian families by 50 per cent, on average, by the end of 2022, and in achieving an average of $10-a-day child care by March 31, 2026
-- the fee reductions in licensed, funded child-care centres are based on 2019 fees
-- licensed, funded child-care providers are receiving additional financial supports this year through their annual funding agreement, including funding to offset the 25 per cent fee reduction for parents and a one-time grant to support a freeze on parent fees that took effect in July 2021

"Health and Wellness / Finance and Treasury Board","Rebate for Fertility Treatments, Surrogacy-related Medical Expenses","FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Rebate for Fertility Treatments, Surrogacy-related Medical Expenses
------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians struggling to expand their families through fertility treatments and surrogacy will benefit from a new tax measure introduced in legislation today, March 30.

The Province will offer a refundable tax credit equal to 40 per cent of the cost of fertility treatments provided by a Nova Scotia-licensed medical practitioner or infertility treatment clinic and for surrogacy-related medical expenses. This measure makes Nova Scotia the first province in Canada to provide this kind of support for surrogacy.

“We recognize the struggle that hopeful parents face starting a family. Not only are infertility challenges extraordinarily stressful, but the cost of fertility treatments and surrogacy-related medical expenses are significant barriers,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “We’re so happy to help Nova Scotians realize their dreams of becoming parents by reducing the financial burden of fertility treatments and surrogacy-related medical expenses.”

The Nova Scotia Fertility and Surrogacy Rebate, part of Budget 2022-23, will provide coverage for people seeking assistance with parenthood, including from the 2SLGBTIQ+ community who previously had no option but to pay the full cost.

There is no limit on the number of treatments that an individual can claim, but the maximum annual claim is $20,000 in eligible costs for a maximum annual tax credit of $8,000.

The new assistance is reflected in an amendment to the Income Tax Act introduced today. More details will be released in due course.

Quotes:
“For those struggling with fertility, and for those who need to access fertility services in order to have a baby, there is a significant negative impact on their mental health, their productivity at work and at home, and also their relationships. The average cost of a single round of IVF in Canada is $20,000 and surrogacy costs are significantly higher, making it an unattainable medical procedure for many to access. This will enable thousands of Nova Scotians to access the care that they need in their province, in order to make their dream of starting a family a reality.”
     - Carolynn Dube, Executive Director, Fertility Matters Canada

Quick Facts:
-- if medically needed services are not offered in the province, a licensed practitioner in Nova Scotia can refer a patient elsewhere
-- Fertility Matters Canada estimates one in six Nova Scotians will face fertility challenges or will need to access fertility care

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians can enjoy sportfishing on one of the province’s many waterways when the 2022 season opens Friday, April 1.

“Sportfishing is a springtime tradition in our province – a very popular, healthy outdoor activity enjoyed by more Nova Scotians than ever before. Sportfishing also supports jobs and economic activity in our rural communities and is important to our tourism industries,” said Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Steve Craig. “I remind anglers to think ‘safety first’ when enjoying time on the water. Please use appropriate catch and release techniques and limit harvests so this valuable sport remains sustainable.”

The sportfishing sector is steadily growing and currently generates about $85 million annually.

Sportfishing licences may be purchased at https://novascotia.ca/fish/sportfishing/ or in person at Department of Natural Resources and Renewables field offices and various retail vendors throughout the province.

Quotes: 
“The Nova Scotia Salmon Association is excited about the opening of the upcoming 2022 sportfishing season. We encourage all sportfishers to practice sound conservation methods such as catch and release and, if you have a chance, please take a kid fishing. Teaching a child to fish encourages an appreciation for nature, promotes a healthy lifestyle and teaches patience.”
      - Brent Locke, Executive Director, Nova Scotia Salmon Association

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Affordable Housing Units for Dartmouth","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Affordable Housing Units for Dartmouth
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing nearly $22 million to create more than 370 affordable housing units in Dartmouth.

“Today, we’re taking real action to provide more Nova Scotians with a safe, comfortable and affordable place to call home,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “This project is a great example of how we can work with our partners, both in the private and non-profit sectors, to address the housing crisis in Nova Scotia.”

The agreement with Clayton Developments will see new energy-efficient townhouses, fourplexes and multi-unit buildings built in the Southdale-Mount Hope area. The Province will invest $21.8 million to create 373 affordable units, included as part of a larger development of 875 homes, townhomes and apartments. Rents for affordable housing units in the development will range from 60 to 80 per cent of average market rents.

The rents for the affordable units will be finalized just before construction begins. Based on current Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation data on average market rent in the area, rent could be as low as $605 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, or $788 a month for a two-bedroom. People who need more support can also apply for a rent supplement from the province; the average rent supplement is $350 a month.

The units must be kept affordable for 20 years.

Construction is expected to begin this fall, with the first affordable housing units becoming available about a year later.

Quotes:
“We are so pleased to work with the Province on this affordable housing development. Affordable housing needs quick and direct access to public transit, grocery stores, as well as places to work and play.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Le gouvernement investit 105 millions de dollars pour améliorer l'infrastructure, favoriser la recherche et améliorer les soins de santé et la formation dans les universités rurales de la province.

« Il est essentiel pour notre avenir économique que nos établissements d'études postsecondaires demeurent concurrentiels et disposent de l'espace et de l'infrastructure nécessaires pour accueillir et former la main-d'oeuvre future, souligne Brian Wong, ministre de l'Éducation postsecondaire. Ces universités sont au coeur de nos collectivités rurales, et ces investissements permettront non seulement d'améliorer l'expérience pour les étudiants, mais également d'accroître l'accès à la formation en soins de santé et de créer des espaces novateurs qui accueilleront des installations de pointe et des gens talentueux qui s'engagent à trouver des solutions. »

L'investissement ponctuel de 105 millions de dollars sera versé en trois parties :
-- des investissements de 65 millions de dollars pour l'entretien différé aux universités St. Francis Xavier, Acadia, Sainte-Anne et Cape Breton;
-- une somme de 35 millions de dollars pour la construction d'un centre de découverte et d'innovation à l'Université Cape Breton;
-- une somme de 5 millions de dollars pour la planification d'une initiative stratégique en matière de santé à l'Université Cape Breton.

Les investissements pour l'entretien différé permettront aux universités rurales d'aborder des retards considérables dans la mise à niveau et l'amélioration de l'infrastructure, par exemple la mise à niveau du système électrique, le remplacement du toit ou l'amélioration de l'accessibilité.

Le centre de découverte et d'innovation à l'Université Cape Breton est un nouveau projet qui hébergera des installations de recherche et d'enseignement à la fine pointe de la technologie. Le centre hébergera les plus récentes technologies écologiques et infrastructures numériques, et il fera de l'île du Cap-Breton une destination nationale pour la recherche, l'innovation et les sciences de la santé, et une destination internationale pour les étudiants.

La planification pour l'initiative stratégique en matière de santé explorera de nouvelles façons de recruter, de former et de maintenir en poste un plus grand nombre de travailleurs de la santé qui sont désespérément nécessaires au Cap-Breton et dans les régions rurales de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing $105 million to improve infrastructure, foster research and enhance healthcare and training at the province’s rural universities.

“Ensuring our post-secondary institutions remain competitive and have the space and infrastructure needed to welcome and train the future workforce is essential for our economic future,” said Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education. “These universities are the heart of our rural communities, and these investments will not only improve the student experience, they will enhance access to healthcare training, and create innovative spaces that will house some of the best research facilities and most talented people committed to finding solutions.”

The $105-million investment is one-time operating funding that includes three pieces:
-- $65 million in deferred maintenance investments at St. Francis Xavier University, Acadia University, Université Sainte-Anne and Cape Breton University (CBU)
-- $35 million toward the construction of a Centre for Discovery and Innovation at CBU
-- $5 million to execute planning for a strategic health initiative at CBU.

The deferred maintenance investments will allow rural universities to address a significant backlog of infrastructure upgrades and improvements. Examples include electrical upgrades, roof replacements and accessibility and mechanical upgrades.

The Centre for Discovery and Innovation at CBU is a new project that will house state-of-the-art research and instructional facilities. The centre will feature the latest in green technology and digital infrastructure and will elevate Cape Breton Island as a national destination for research, innovation, health sciences, and a global destination for students.

The planning for the strategic health initiative will research and explore new ways to recruit, train, and retain more vital healthcare workers that Cape Bretoners and Nova Scotians in rural areas of the province desperately need.  

Quotes:
“This is a monumental day for Cape Breton University. We are absolutely thrilled that the Province of Nova Scotia is recognizing the needs of our students, our employees and our community. The announcements made today here at CBU are transformational and a game-changer. This allows us to invest in infrastructure for our students and our faculty. This investment will further allow us to attract both Canadian and international students to study in expanded science, engineering, technology and medical-related programs at CBU. Again, this is a game-changer for Cape Breton Island.”
     - David C. Dingwall, President and Vice-Chancellor, Cape Breton University

“St. FX is extremely pleased to learn of the Nova Scotia government's $23.4 million funding announcement for deferred maintenance projects on its campus. The government’s commitment to building a strong post-secondary system is applauded as is their investment in the economy of the northeastern region of Nova Scotia. This funding will allow St. FX to continue, and enhance, its impact in rural Nova Scotia by strongly supporting its mission to build a university the way it is meant to be.”
     - Andy Hakin, President and Vice-Chancellor, St. Francis Xavier University

“This investment will help Université Sainte-Anne modernize its campus infrastructure and make us more competitive. Improvements to facilities will go a long way in allowing us to continue to support not only our student population and staff, but also our local communities.”
     - Allister Surette, President and Vice-Chancellor, Université Sainte-Anne

“Acadia is cherished for its historic beauty and sought after for the transformative education it provides students. However, the storied buildings of Acadia’s campus require substantial upkeep and rejuvenation to serve the learning and living needs of our campus community. We are very grateful to the provincial government for this significant investment that will allow us to make substantial progress in addressing deferred maintenance and accelerate plans to improve accessibility and energy efficiency on our historic campus.”
     - Peter Ricketts, President and Vice-Chancellor, Acadia University

Quick Facts:
-- St. Francis Xavier will receive $23.4 million for deferred maintenance; Acadia University will receive $22 million; Cape Breton University will receive $14 million; and Université Sainte-Anne will receive $5.6 million
-- the funding was allocated to each institution based on the university’s share of the total operating funding provided to the four universities

"Community Services","Government Committed to Child and Youth Commission","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Government Committed to Child and Youth Commission
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Good government puts people at the centre of all that we do. This commitment will be at the heart of the creation of a Child and Youth Commission in Nova Scotia.

This commission will be unique to our province and is the direct result of a recommendation from the Restorative Inquiry into the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children.

Other provinces have child and youth advocates in place and typically their work is driven by complaints, but the restorative inquiry recommended a different, more comprehensive alternative.

The Child and Youth Commission will be completely independent of government and will be guided by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It will have all the authorities and powers of a Child and Youth Advocate and will, in fact, expand on these powers and authorities.

The commission will also be proactive and will have a wide mandate to review services for children and youth provided by the departments of Community Services, Education and Early Childhood Development, Health and Wellness, and Justice. This means the commission will be looking at everything from child protection to educational programs to mental health and addiction services. Essentially, no area of government that relates to children and youth will be outside the commission’s scope.

Over the next few months, we will be engaging with those within the child welfare system, former children in care, community partners and others across the province. Their ideas and insight will help shape the commission.

The creation and design of this commission will be one of the legacies of the Restorative Inquiry into the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. These learnings guide us as we shape changes in how our government serves the needs of the children in our province.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing an additional $3 million to support construction of the Jordantown-Acaciaville-Conway Betterment Association (JACBA) Center of Excellence. 

The centre will be a state-of-the-art facility promoting collaboration among community, education, and economic institutions within Digby and the surrounding area. It will include a community room, gymnasium, stage, fitness room, library, meeting room, seniors’ area, and rental space.

“The government is proud to support community-led projects that help improve equity and inclusion for people of African descent,” said African Nova Scotian Affairs Minister Pat Dunn. “The JACBA Center of Excellence would not be possible without the ongoing work of the Jordantown-Acaciaville-Conway Betterment Association, Digby Education Committee, and local community members.”

In November 2018, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments announced funding toward the centre totalling more than $5.5 million. However, due to changes in building code requirements and project delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional $3 million is required. 

The total cost of the JACBA Center of Excellence is about $9 million. 

Quotes:
“With my background in education, including several years serving in the Digby area, I personally know the years of hard work and dedication it took to make this vision come to life, spanning more than a decade. Community centres, like the JACBA Center of Excellence, are fundamental to the growth, prosperity, and success of our province.”
     - Dwayne Provo, Associate Deputy Minister, African Nova Scotian Affairs

“It has been many, many hours bringing our project to this point. We thank the Nova Scotia government for their support in bringing this project to a reality.”
     - Kerry Johnson, President, Jordantown-Acaciaville-Conway Betterment Association

“Members of the Black community of Digby have been extremely patient over the years and are anxiously awaiting the completed construction of the Center of Excellence.”
     - Brad Barton, facilitator for the Black community of Digby

Quick Facts:
--- in 2012, the Digby Education Committee tasked JACBA to advocate for a centre of excellence for the Black communities of the Digby area as a result of a human rights settlement agreement
-- in May 1970, members of the Black communities of Jordantown, Acaciaville and Conway met as group to deal with the needs in the community resulting in the incorporation of an organization in 1971 which was renamed JACBA in 2013
-- JACBA is a non-profit organization designated to address inequalities such as employment, housing, education, and lack of social activities in African Nova Scotian communities in Digby and surrounding rural areas
-- in 2018, the provincial contribution to JACBA was about $3.7 million

----------------------------------------------------------------
Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr has designated nine special planning areas in Halifax Regional Municipality for as many as 22,600 new residential units.

The designation allows the Minister to assume authority for development approvals in those areas as outlined in the Housing in the Halifax Regional Municipality Act.

The special planning areas are:
-- former Penhorn Mall lands, 950 units
-- Southdale/Mount Hope, 1,200 units
-- Bedford West 10, 1,300 units

-- Indigo Shores, 150 building lots
-- Morris Lake expansion, 3,100 units
-- Dartmouth Crossing, 2,500 units
-- Sandy Lake, 6,000 units.

“The housing shortage is a major challenge across the province, but it is particularly severe in the Halifax region. We need to act now to address it,” said Minister Lohr. “These nine special planning areas could offer a significant number of new homes for people in the region and save months, even years, in approval time. I want to thank the municipality for its support and collaboration as we work on solutions.”

Projects are subject to required permitting, fees and regulatory requirements as specified within the Housing in the Halifax Regional Municipality Act.

The Province is also investing $2.3 million to enable the municipality to conduct critical environmental, land-use suitability, transportation and infrastructure studies to inform future planning and development decisions.

As well, a call for an independent third-party review of the barriers to housing development closed on March 22.

Recommendations to the Minister were provided by the Halifax Regional Municipality housing task force, led by former cabinet minister Geoff MacLellan. Members include Paul LaFleche, Deputy Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing; Stephen MacIsaac, CEO of Housing Nova Scotia; Kelly Denty, the municipality’s Executive Director of Planning and Development; and Peter Duncan, the municipality’s Director of Infrastructure Planning.

Maps of the special planning areas and copies of the orders issued by the Minister are available at: https://novascotia.ca/housing-panel/ 

Quotes:
“I am pleased that the nine areas announced today are within communities designated for growth through the municipal regional planning process, and that there are a number of other measures through which the Province of Nova Scotia is supporting Halifax Regional Municipality in providing solutions to the housing crisis.”
     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality

“We’ve been absolutely laser-focused on finding solutions to add more housing in the Halifax region so all residents have a place to call home. The task force members have been committed to problem-solving from the start. It’s their hard work and co-operation that’s brought us so far. We’re energized and excited to continue this important work.”  
     - Geoff MacLellan, Chair, Halifax Regional Municipality Housing Task Force

Quick Facts:
-- the Halifax Regional Municipality housing task force was appointed on November 25, 2021

The Province is writing off $15.8 million in debts considered uncollectable as of March 31, 2022.

Writeoffs are a normal cost of doing business for any organization, public or private.

“Writeoffs are a standard accounting practice and while these transactions originated in previous fiscal years, they will have no impact on departmental budgets or Nova Scotia’s bottom line for the current fiscal year,” said Allan MacMaster, Minister of Finance and Treasury Board.

None of the 2021-22 writeoffs are related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of them are uncollectable ambulance fees and Pharmacare premiums at Health and Wellness, various unpaid fines at Justice, outstanding loan balances at Agriculture, and unpaid student loans at Advanced Education.

Quick Facts:
-- although a debt is written off, efforts to collect the funds continue
-- this accounting process is in line with Nova Scotia’s Finance Act

Legislation introduced today, March 25, will repeal the Crosbie Memorial Trust Fund Act.

The act, established in 2003, authorized a volunteer board to administer the Crosbie Memorial Trust Fund. The fund was established to support abstinence-based addictions services under the former Annapolis Valley Health Authority. It was built by payments of fines imposed on people who committed drug- or alcohol-related offences.

An amendment to the act in 2012 transferred the remaining funds to the Crosbie House Society board of directors. The funds have since been spent in full and the trust and its board are no longer active, making the legislation redundant.

Amendments introduced today, March 25, will modernize the Condominium Act, improving the governance and management of condominium corporations and enhancing consumer protection.

“By making changes to the act, the rules condominium owners and corporations need to follow will be current and relevant to their day-to-day work,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “They will also improve consumer protection by creating more transparency for current and prospective condo owners.”

The changes will improve governance and management by ensuring a smooth transition between the developer’s board and the first board elected by the condominium corporation. They include:
-- clarifying the percentage of the affirmative vote required to make decisions and set timelines for the first general meeting
-- prohibiting the developer from purchasing additional units on behalf of the corporation until the first elected board is in place
-- requiring more frequent reserve-fund studies to help corporations plan for future capital repairs
-- allowing corporations to modernize voting methods such as accepting ballots by email.

The amendments enhance consumer protection and create transparency by requiring unit owners to disclose property rental agreements to their condo board, and that bare land condominiums be clearly advertised as condos.

Quick Facts:
-- a bare land condominium is a type of condominium complex in which the owners each own their individual lot

Le rapport épidémiologique hebdomadaire de la Nouvelle-Écosse indique une augmentation continue du nombre de cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire. Entre les 16 et 22 mars, il y a eu 13 décès et 36 nouvelles hospitalisations. Les personnes de 65 ans et plus et celles qui sont partiellement vaccinées ou non vaccinées continuent de présenter les taux les plus élevés de maladie grave et de décès à cause de la COVID-19.

« Les données dans le rapport de cette semaine ne sont pas une surprise, indique le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous continuons d’observer les effets de la première et de la deuxième phase de notre reprise des activités dans l’augmentation des résultats positifs aux tests PCR. Ce sont toujours les premiers indicateurs. Nous allons surveiller de près l’impact sur le nombre d’hospitalisations dans les semaines à venir.

Du 16 au 22 mars :
-- Parmi les tests PCR analysés en laboratoire, 3 453 ont donné un résultat positif. 
-- Trente-six nouvelles personnes ont été hospitalisées et 20 ont obtenu leur congé.
-- À l'heure actuelle, 42 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et l'âge médian des personnes hospitalisées est de 65 ans.
-- De ce nombre, 21,4 % sont partiellement vaccinées ou non vaccinées.
-- Durant cette même période, 13 décès attribuables à la COVID-19 ont été saisis dans Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique.
-- L'âge médian des personnes décédées de la COVID-19 depuis le début de la vague Omicron (le 8 décembre 2021) est de 79 ans, et 24,8 % de ces personnes étaient partiellement vaccinées ou non vaccinées.
-- Au 22 mars, 87,2 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse sont entièrement vaccinés, 5 % sont partiellement vaccinés et 7,8 % ne sont pas vaccinés.
-- Au 22 mars, 63,4 % des gens de 18 ans ou plus ont reçu une dose de rappel.

« Je pense aux familles qui ont perdu un être cher à cause de la COVID-19, ajoute le Dr Strang. La pandémie n’est pas finie, et il faut continuer de faire ce que nous pouvons pour nous protéger les uns les autres. Nous savons que le meilleur moyen de défense contre Omicron et le variant BA.2 est le vaccin, et la dose de rappel, particulièrement pour les adultes. La dose de rappel est bien plus qu’une prime, elle est incroyablement importante pour maximiser notre protection contre une maladie grave, ce qui, par ricochet, aide à protéger les gens de notre entourage. »

Nova Scotia’s weekly epidemiological report shows a continued increase in lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Between March 16 and 22, there were 13 deaths and 36 new hospital admissions. People aged 65 or older, and those who are partially vaccinated or unvaccinated, continue to have the highest rates of severe disease and death from COVID-19.

“The data in this week’s report is not unexpected,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We continue to see the impact of the first and second phases of our reopening reflected in the increase in PCR positive tests. This is always our earliest indicator. We will be closely monitoring the impact on hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.”

From March 16 to 22:
-- there were 3,453 positive PCR tests performed at the lab
-- there were 36 new hospital admissions due to COVID-19 and 20 discharges
-- there are 42 people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 with a median age of 65
-- of the current hospitalizations, 21.4 per cent were partially vaccinated or unvaccinated
-- there were 13 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama, public health’s disease information system, during this period
-- the median age of COVID-19 reported deaths since the start of the Omicron wave (December 8, 2021) is 79, and 24.8 per cent of people were partially vaccinated or unvaccinated
-- as of March 22, 87.2 per cent of Nova Scotians were fully vaccinated, five per cent were partially vaccinated, and 7.8 per cent were unvaccinated
-- as of March 22, 63.4 of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose.

“My thoughts are with the families of those whose loved ones died of COVID-19,” said Dr. Strang. “The pandemic is not over – nor is the need to do our part as individuals to keep ourselves and others safe. We know that the very best line of defence against Omicron and the BA.2 variant is vaccine; and in particular, for adults, a booster dose. The booster is much more than a bonus – it is incredibly important to maximize our protection against severe illness, which, in turn, helps protect the people around us.”

“Nova Scotia continues to be a leader in developing tidal energy technology and research, and these amendments will help keep us there,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “This industry has enormous potential for our province as a clean source of energy, as a job creator in rural areas and as an opportunity to build expertise and exportable green technology.”

The amendments, tabled in the legislature today, March 24, will allow multiple projects to share subsea infrastructure, such as moorings or anchors, to reduce project costs. They will add greater clarity around the rights provided with a license and the geographic area of a licence.

There are also improvements to the Demonstration Permit Program that will create a competitive evaluation process instead of providing permits on a first-come, first-served basis. The process will ensure the projects that offer the best value to Nova Scotians are approved.

A demonstration permit is a type of marine renewable-energy permit that allows project developers to test or demonstrate new ways of generating marine renewable energy. With a demonstration permit, a developer can deploy and connect a device to the province’s electrical grid. A demonstration project is allowed up to 5 megawatts of new generating capacity, with a total of 10 megawatts available under the program.

Quick Facts:
-- project developers can also apply for a permit to test devices that do not connect to the electrical grid
-- the Province has issued permits to five companies for a total of 10MWs 
-- Nova Scotia is a leader in fighting climate change setting the most ambitious emission reduction targets in the country
-- other amendments are mainly administrative

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Amendments to Wildlife Act","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Amendments to Wildlife Act
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government has introduced amendments to the Wildlife Act that will protect the province’s wildlife and help wildlife and people coexist without conflict.

Under the amendments, tabled in the legislature today, March 24, the government can develop regulations to discourage the feeding of wildlife.

“Feeding is typically driven by good intentions, and people’s wish to enjoy wildlife, but it can lead to the spread of disease and risks to the health and safety of people and wildlife,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “The ability to develop new regulations will help address this growing problem by focusing on problematic or chronic situations without affecting traditional or low-risk activities or people’s enjoyment of wildlife.”

The Department of Natural Resources and Renewables responds to thousands of calls about human-wildlife conflict each year. Situations include wildlife showing bold or threatening behaviours, property destruction, crop or livestock damage and public safety concerns. Wildlife feeding, whether deliberate or unintentional, can be a significant contributor to these conflicts.

The Province will consult with stakeholders and municipalities to develop regulations that target problematic situations that impact the safety of people and wildlife. The regulations will not apply to low-risk activities like backyard bird feeding.

Quotes:
“The Town of Truro has been dealing with a high population of urban deer for several years now. The Town has had a Wildlife Feeding Bylaw in place since 2006 and has continued to educate residents on the importance of this issue. In completing our Deer Management Strategy in 2021, we know that the most important tool is to stop residents from feeding the deer. With the provincial government introducing these amendments, it will help to reinforce the importance of this issue, and further help municipalities with this growing concern.”
     - Bill Mills, Mayor, Truro

“Many people feed wildlife with the best of intentions or think it's necessary to help animals survive. However, this is misguided kindness. Natural diets are more varied and more nutritious than human-sourced foods. Wild animals can become dependent on human food. Feeding can also lead to wildlife mortality and conflict situations with people. The best way we can care for wildlife is to address activities that put animals at risk.”
     - Dr. Megan Jones, veterinarian and Regional Director, Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative-Atlantic Region

Quick Facts:
-- while the regulations will not apply to backyard bird feeding, Nova Scotians should avoid feeding or handling wild birds and stop using birdfeeders to prevent disease spread of avian influenza 
-- new wildlife feeding regulations will help reduce the incidence of orphaned or injured animals

"Justice","Amendments to Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act Introduced","JUSTICE--Amendments to Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act Introduced
----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, March 24, will make it easier for Nova Scotia families living in different parts of the country to collect court-ordered child and spousal support payments from their ex-partners and spouses.

Amendments to the Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act will simplify the process for establishing, varying and enforcing child and spousal support orders when one party lives in Nova Scotia and the other party lives in another province or territory.  

“We want to make sure children and families get the court-ordered support payments they are entitled to,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Brad Johns. “Where you live in Canada should not limit your ability to receive maintenance payments. This legislation will help families get the support they need in an easier and faster way.”

The changes will reduce administrative burden on the courts and help minimize delays. The amendments include eliminating the requirement for certified copies of court orders and documents to be sworn. The legislation also improves the process for hearing evidence and permits the use of electronic documents, removing the requirement for paper copies. 

Quick Facts: 
-- the Province’s Maintenance and Enforcement Program (MEP) assists families and children by administering child and spousal support orders 
-- the program supports more than 12,000 children and collects and pays out nearly $230,000 in child support and spousal support to recipients every day
-- MEP has been working across jurisdictions for a number of years to improve the enforcement of support orders of payors who have moved out of the province 
-- almost 13,900 cases are enrolled in the program representing about 27,800 clients, including both recipients and payors
-- there are about 2,200 Interjurisdictional Support Orders administered by the program and women represent about 96 per cent of all support order recipients

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The government will further reduce barriers for healthcare providers to report patient-safety incidents with an amendment introduced today, March 24, to the Quality Improvement Information Protection Act.

Each patient-safety incident reported results in a review. Currently, the act protects information that may identify a patient, provider or participant involved in the quality review process. However, the act does not have a provision to protect this information from being disclosed if another piece of legislation compels it to do so.

“When healthcare providers report patient incidents, it helps us improve the healthcare system, the provision of health services and patient outcomes,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “The amendment will protect information that may identify people involved in the quality review process. This will give the assurance providers need to feel comfortable to report patient-safety incidents.”

The amendment will ensure the Quality Improvement Information Protection Act prevails in situations where it conflicts with another piece of legislation.

This will ensure that identifying information is not released. This amendment does not impact the release of recommendations or outcomes from the quality review process.

Quick Facts:
-- the Quality Improvement Information Protection Act was introduced on April 21, 2015

The Province is taking action to stop people from protesting outside the homes of senior health officials and other health service providers. 

Amendments to the Protecting Access to Health Services Act, introduced today, March 24, will protect provincial health officials and members of their families from harassment and intimidation by establishing a safe zone around their private residences.

“Nova Scotians have a right to protest, but protesters cannot be allowed to harass, intimidate or stalk people in their own homes. That is unacceptable,” said Minister of Justice and Attorney General Brad Johns. “This legislation protects the people making important public health decisions on behalf of all Nova Scotians – and their families.”

The amendments expand on legislation introduced last fall to ensure patients and health service providers access to or provision of health services at hospitals and other healthcare facilities.

The legislation established a 50-metre access or safe zone – a bubble – around facilities so patients and health providers can access healthcare facilities. The law also applies to patients receiving care in their homes.

The amendments will expand the definition of “health service facility” to include private residences of health service providers. The amendments will also expand the definition of “health service provider” to include senior officials and other executive decision-makers in the health sector.

The legislation will come into force upon Royal Assent.

Quick Facts:
-- fines under the amended Protecting Access to Health Services Act will range from $5,000 for individuals to $100,000 for corporations

"Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives","Legislation Will Address Systemic Racism, Hate and Inequity","EQUITY/ANTI-RACISM INITIATIVES--Legislation Will Address Systemic Racism, Hate and Inequity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A statement by Minister Dunn, read in the House of Assembly today, March 24, follows the release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, March 24, with the support of all parties, will make Nova Scotia a leader in addressing systemic racism, hate and inequity.

The Dismantling Racism and Hate Act, developed by an all-party committee following extensive engagement with Nova Scotians, outlines the government’s approach to addressing systemic racism, hate and inequity and commits to developing a provincial strategy and a health equity framework by July 2023. 

It enables the government to require other public bodies, such as municipalities, villages, colleges and universities, to develop strategies as well.

“This bill is the first of its kind in Canada, and it’s important that we did it together,” said Pat Dunn, Minister responsible for the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives. “I want to thank the members of the all-party committee and the hundreds of Nova Scotians who helped shape this legislation. We know that this is a step on the journey, not the destination. We must continue to work together to address racism and hate and create a more equitable Nova Scotia.”

The bill’s other provisions include committing the Province to work with marginalized and racialized communities to create a community network and develop data standards to monitor and address systemic hate, inequity and racism. The Minister will be required to submit an annual progress report on equity and anti-racism measures beginning in July 2023.

Quotes:
“Government can – and must – play a critical role in dismantling racism, hate and inequity in our province. Far too often the voices of people and communities who have experienced discrimination are not in the rooms where decisions are being made. This legislation will work to address that and create an ongoing dialogue between government and community. It will also define the hate and racism that is all too real for many Nova Scotians. This is the first of many necessary steps.”
     - Angela Simmonds, MLA for Preston, Deputy Speaker of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly 

“I’m glad to see this legislation come forward. My community needs to see action on dismantling racism and hate. The NDP Caucus put proposals forward for this legislation, and some of them were included. Many others were not. We are looking forward to hearing from all community members through the law amendments process and finding ways to further strengthen this bill.” 
     - Suzy Hansen, MLA for Halifax Needham, NDP African Nova Scotian Affairs spokesperson

Quick Facts:
-- along with Minister Dunn, the all-party committee included Ali Duale, MLA for Halifax Armdale; Suzy Hansen, MLA for Halifax Needham; Tony Ince, MLA for Cole Harbour; Lisa Lachance, MLA for Halifax Citadel-Sable Island; Angela Simmonds, MLA for Preston; and Kent Smith, MLA for Eastern Shore
-- the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives held 71 focus groups and engagement sessions on the proposed legislation in January and February involving 1,223 Nova Scotians
-- 744 people participated through the Office’s engagement website and 56 responded to an online survey
-- Nova Scotia is the first province to introduce legislation that specifically addresses hate, racism and inequity

Statement by Pat Dunn, Minister responsible for the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives:

Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, I want to ask my following colleagues to rise in their places:

The Honourable Member for Cole Harbour
The Member for Halifax Armdale
The Member for Preston
The Member for Halifax Citadel-Sable Island
The Member for Halifax Needham and
The Member for Eastern Shore

Mr. Speaker, these Members have done something remarkable.  They came together across political lines to create ground-breaking and historic legislation to address hate, racism and inequity.

Later today, I will introduce the bill - only because the rules of the House dictate that I do.

But I want to be clear that this is not MY bill. This legislation came together as a result of frank discussions, compromise and thoughtful debate on the part of the MLAs I named. And they’ll have a chance to respond to this statement and speak to this bill in a few moments.

This legislation was also made possible because of the hard work of:

Deputy Minister Catherine Berliner
Associate Deputy Minister Dwayne Provo
DeRico Symonds, Senior Executive Advisor
Christine Gibbons, Executive Director, Strategic Policy & Innovation, and;
the dedicated staff at the offices of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives and African Nova Scotian Affairs.

Mr. Speaker, staff worked seven days a week to undertake an extensive round of engagement. They held more than 70 online sessions with organizations, community groups and interested Nova Scotians—that’s well over 100 hours of direct engagement. They ran a survey and gathered feedback through a website, by email, and by telephone.

In the span of about six weeks, Mr. Speaker, they heard from more than 2,000 Nova Scotians—and they analyzed and organized all that feedback so we could make informed decisions at the all-party committee.

The work these committed civil servants did will serve as the gold standard for governments across the country, and it helped us produce legislation that will be the first of its kind in Canada. On behalf of all Nova Scotians, I want to thank them for their exceptional contributions to this process and to their province.

I also want to extend my sincere thanks to every Nova Scotian who participated in the consultation sessions.  Their opinions, experiences and suggestions shaped the work we did.  I especially want to thank those who acknowledged that they have often felt overlooked or unheard by government, and who took a risk in sharing sometimes difficult or painful experiences in the hopes of making things better across this province.

I hope they can hear their voices reflected in the bill that will be tabled later today. And I want to assure them that this is a step on our journey, not the end.

Mr. Speaker, today, with the introduction of legislation we—as a province—will say with ONE VOICE that racism and hate are not acceptable in Nova Scotia.  We are providing a framework to guide us as we dismantle racism and eliminate hate in our province.

We are making Nova Scotia a stronger and better place for ALL Nova Scotians. I think that’s an important message to share, Mr. Speaker. When we say no to hate and racism, when we address long-standing inequity, we create conditions where everyone can thrive.

Mr. Speaker, when I began my remarks I recognized six Members of the Legislature from all three parties.

I want to close by telling them – through you – what a humbling and fulfilling experience it has been to have worked with them in this process.

I am thankful for the experience, and for the expertise that they each brought to this milestone legislation, and I am immensely proud of the work we produced.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province will provide $13.2 million to vulnerable Nova Scotians to help them address the immediate impact of rising fuel prices on the cost of living.

The support package announced today, March 24, includes:
-- a one-time payment of $150 to all current income assistance recipients, including Disability Support Program participants receiving income support; for example, a single parent on income assistance with three children will receive $600
-- a one-time payment of $150 to all currently eligible recipients of the Heating Assistance Rebate Program; the payment is expected to be made by the end of April
-- $1 million to Feed Nova Scotia to distribute among their 140 food banks provincewide
-- $200,000 to local food banks across the province which are not part of the Feed Nova Scotia network.

“This is a challenging time for Nova Scotians living on lower incomes,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “Current global events have introduced significant volatility and are driving up basic living expenses for many families, individuals and seniors. They are working hard to stretch their income to make ends meet and this support will make a difference.”

Payments to eligible recipients of income assistance and the Disability Support Program will be processed next week. People who receive assistance through this year’s Heating Assistance Rebate Program will automatically receive the extra $150 payment. People are still able to apply to the program until March 31 at: https://www.novascotia.ca/heatinghelp and through Access Nova Scotia, and Community Services and MLA offices.

“Record high fuel prices have created challenges and put financial strain on many Nova Scotians, especially those with low incomes,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “We recognize the impact this is having so we are increasing the rebate we give through the Heating Assistance Rebate program so we can provide more financial help.”

Quick Facts:
-- the income threshold to qualify for the heating rebate program is $29,000 for single-income households and $44,000 for family-income households
-- on average, this program provides more than 45,000 eligible Nova Scotians with a rebate of up to $200 to help with home heating costs
-- the investment announced today will assist 35,416 people who rely on income assistance and 2,794 Disability Support Program clients

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Dates for in-person community consultation sessions are listed following this release.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is taking an important step in addressing systemic racism in the justice system by developing an African Nova Scotian Justice Plan.

The plan will help address barriers to justice faced by African Nova Scotians. A key part of its development will be consulting with African Nova Scotian communities, and 16 in-person sessions across the province are planned for May 3 to June 28.

“The voices of African Nova Scotian community members are a critical part of the plan development,” said Attorney General and Justice Minister Brad Johns. “Our government is committed to addressing systemic racism and discrimination in the justice system. We acknowledge the negative experiences this has on African Nova Scotians, and we must take steps to improve access, remove barriers, ensure fairness and improve the relationship between African Nova Scotian communities and the justice system.”

The African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition and the Association of Black Social Workers are partnering with the Province on the consultation. Three of the public engagement sessions will focus on youth.

An online survey will also launch in May and be available through the consultation phase.

Input from the public engagement sessions will be captured in a report that will be shared with communities for feedback as part of a second phase of consultation scheduled for later this year.

The Government is investing $3.5 million to help volunteer fire departments, ground search and rescue organizations and First Nations fire departments recover from fundraising losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.  More than 340 organizations will each receive a one-time grant of $10,000.

“The pandemic has had a big impact on municipalities and volunteer fire departments,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Firefighters and ground search and rescue crews are great at raising money in their community, but their efforts were held back by COVID. We hope this will help make up for some fundraising losses.”

Each organization can determine how to use the grant to best meet the needs of the department, its volunteers or the needs of the wider community. This could include directing the funds toward new equipment or operations, smoke alarm campaigns or an honorarium for volunteer firefighters to assist with increased costs.

Quotes:
“Our volunteer fire departments, ground search and rescue crews, and First Nations fire departments are the first to respond when their communities and residents need help. This is our opportunity to recognize their important contributions and provide some relief from the impacts of COVID-19.”
     - John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing

“Over the last two years, lockdowns and social distancing mandates have had a severe impact on our department's ability to fundraise. Our garden party alone usually raises over $12,000 a year. Additionally, membership was affected, both in maintaining and recruiting, due to the pandemic. Despite these challenges, our department went above and beyond to maintain a high level of quality emergency service and this funding will allow us to continue to provide this level of service to our community.”
     - Jared Swinemar, Chief, Western Shore and District Volunteer Fire Department

The Province is acting on its commitment to increase presumptive coverage to 19 cancers from six and to include heart attacks that occur within 24 hours of an emergency call.

“Firefighters put their health at risk and their lives on the line every day,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Those who protect us should, in turn, be protected by their government and have access to the workplace injury coverage they need when they need it.”

The additional coverage will be in amendments to the Firefighters Compensation Regulations under the Workers’ Compensation Act. The 13 types of cancer being added are: esophageal, lung, testicular, ureter, breast, multiple myeloma, prostate, skin, ovarian, cervical, penile, thyroid, and pancreatic. There is existing coverage for bladder, brain, colorectal and kidney cancer, leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

“About 6,600 firefighters and their families will benefit from these changes, making Nova Scotia one of the leading provinces in Canada for presumptive coverage for firefighters,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “I’d like to thank our firefighters for helping to advance these changes, and for the sacrifices they and their families make every day to keep us safe.”

The amended regulations take effect July 1. Firefighters with a cancer diagnosis since July 1, 2021, will be able to access the expanded benefits.

The Province will cover the total liability cost of $80.6 million for four fiscal years. Municipalities will not incur additional liability costs until 2025-26.

Quotes:
“These amendments are an important step to provide firefighters and their families with increased access to coverage as we committed to do as part of our ministerial mandate. I am proud that this government has been able to introduce these changes within our first year in government as a sign of our commitment to fix healthcare in Nova Scotia.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“These protections are the most significant improvements in firefighter presumptive cancer coverage in Canadian history, bringing Nova Scotia’s firefighters from the least protected in Canada to the most protected. On behalf of firefighters and our families, I thank the government for keeping their word to Nova Scotia’s firefighters. This is a great day!”
     - Capt. Brendan Meagher, President, Halifax Professional Firefighters, IAFF Local 268

Quick Facts:
-- more than 6,000 volunteer firefighters and 600 paid firefighters work in Nova Scotia
-- Nova Scotia joins Manitoba and the Yukon as leaders in the country for presumptive cancer coverage for firefighters
-- the Province will cover $67.4 million in initial liability costs for municipalities in 2021-22, and $4.4 million in annual liability costs for 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25
-- Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration staff reviewed multiple studies and consulted firefighters, organizations representing firefighters, and municipal representatives throughout the province on revising the regulations

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing $1.2 million in a 10-kilometre multi-use woodland and lakeside trail outside Mahone Bay.

The funding will be used to help repair two bridges on the Dynamite Trail – Mush-a-Mush River Bridge and Martins River Bridge. The work will include stabilizing the base of both bridges, replacing mortar on the columns, refurbishing beams and replacing the decking.

“Connecting the communities of Martins River and Mahone Bay, this trail provides opportunities for residents and visitors to get outside to enjoy and explore the beauty of Nova Scotia’s South Shore,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development and MLA for Lunenburg, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “Trails contribute significantly to our communities and enable Nova Scotians to lead healthy, active lifestyles.”

The Mush-a-Mush River Bridge’s two concrete abutments and two concrete piers were built in 1923, replacing the original timber trestle built in 1905. It has two steel plate girder spans and one steel truss span. The Martins River Bridge has one granite masonry abutment and two granite masonry piers with two steel plate girder spans connecting to a timber trestle approach on the east side.

Quotes:
“This announcement is a significant step forward for the provincial government in funding maintenance of the rails-to-trails infrastructure. It enables the volunteer groups to move forward with major projects which must be completed in a specific time frame to meet requirements of the Environment Department. As a result of this funding, the Dynamite Trail Association can move forward with the refurbishment of the bridges.”
     - Sandy Hamilton, Chair, Dynamite Trail Association

Quick Facts:
-- Martins River Bridge and Mush-a-Mush Bridge are both about 100 metres long and five storeys above the river surface
-- the Dynamite Trail is one of seven trails that make up the Rum Runners Trail that connects Halifax to Lunenburg as part of the former rail bed

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","La 3e phase commence le 21 mars, le port du masque est maintenu dans les écoles","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--La 3e phase commence le 21 mars, le port du masque est maintenu dans les écoles  
--------------------------------------------------------
Le 21 mars, la plupart des restrictions provinciales en matière de santé publique seront levées, y compris les limites concernant les rassemblements, l’éloignement physique et le port du masque. Certaines mesures resteront en vigueur dans les milieux à risque élevé, comme les établissements de soins de santé et de soins de longue durée 

Le port du masque reste obligatoire dans les écoles publiques pour encore quelques semaines. 

« Je sais que les élèves et les parents auront des réactions mitigées concernant la décision de conserver le masque pour encore un peu, a dit le premier ministre Tim Houston. Quand nous avons en main de nouveaux renseignements, nous réévaluons. Cette semaine, huit des pédiatres les plus en vue de la province se sont exprimés sur la question; après en avoir discuté avec le Dr (Robert) Strang et le Dr (Andrew) Lynk, et après les avoir écoutés attentivement, nous sommes d’avis que le changement est opportun. Pour les autres personnes, vous n’avez pas besoin de restrictions pour continuer à porter le masque et à poser les gestes nécessaires pour vous protéger et pour protéger les autres. » 

À compter de minuit une le lundi 21 mars : 
-- il n’y aura plus de limite sur les rassemblements ni sur la capacité d’accueil des lieux publics, mais les gens devraient quand même continuer de garder leurs groupes sociaux petits et uniformes et faire des choix judicieux quant aux rassemblements auxquels ils assisteront;
-- l’éloignement physique entre les personnes et les groupes ne sera plus exigé même si l’éloignement physique est toujours recommandé;
-- le port du masque n’est plus exigé, mais il est fortement recommandé dans les lieux publics intérieurs ou les espaces extérieurs bondés;
-- les entreprises et les organismes dans tous les secteurs d’activité peuvent reprendre toutes leurs activités sans restrictions imposées par la Santé publique; 
-- les activités spéciales comme les festivals, les activités sportives, les spectacles, les rencontres, les entraînements et les cérémonies religieuses peuvent reprendre sans restrictions.

« La pandémie n’est pas finie. La COVID-19 est toujours présente dans nos collectivités et pour certains, le virus reste mortel, a précisé le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La plupart de nos restrictions provinciales prennent fin, mais il faudrait conserver nos bonnes habitudes sanitaires. Vous devriez continuer de porter un masque quand vous sortez, faites-vous vacciner, restez à la maison quand vous êtes malade, passer un test de dépistage pour protéger les personnes vulnérables et limitez le nombre de personnes aux rassemblements. Ces gestes individuels, posés dans un souci d’attention envers les autres, nous aideront à rester en santé. » 

Dans les écoles publiques, le personnel et les élèves suivront les conseils les plus récents contenus dans le Plan pour le retour à l’école, y compris ceux qui suivent :
-- le personnel, les élèves et les visiteurs continueront de porter le masque pour encore quelques semaines durant les heures de classe et dans les autobus scolaires;
-- les visiteurs et les spectateurs devront porter un masque dans les écoles durant les heures d’enseignement pendant encore quelques semaines;
-- on demande au personnel et aux élèves de suivre les mesures essentielles de santé publique, notamment se faire vacciner si on est admissible, rester à la maison si on ne se sent pas bien, suivre la liste de contrôle quotidien de la COVID-19 et se laver ou se désinfecter les mains souvent;
-- les leçons de musique, les pratiques de fanfares, les arts et les sports dans les écoles peuvent reprendre toutes leurs activités; 
-- les tournois, les concerts et les activités parascolaires sont permises;
-- la planification des cérémonies de remise des diplômes peut aller de l’avant.

Pour en savoir davantage : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr.

Dans les établissements de soins de longue durée :
-- les résidents peuvent recevoir cinq visiteurs en même temps si l’établissement peut les accueillir;
-- des groupes de visiteurs plus importants sont permis lors d’occasions spéciales, comme l’anniversaire de naissance d’un résident ou un anniversaire spécial, si l’établissement peut les accueillir;
-- les visiteurs doivent porter un masque et être entièrement vaccinés, à l'exception des visiteurs pour les résidents en fin de vie;
-- peu importe le statut vaccinal, les résidents peuvent sortir de l’établissement pour n’importe quelle raison, y compris pour aller passer la nuit avec la famille.

La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse et le IWK Health Centre maintiendront l’exigence du port du masque et les restrictions visant les visiteurs. 

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 doit s’isoler, remplir l’autoévaluation en ligne et prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage. Les personnes qui présentent un risque accru de maladie grave, qui vivent dans une habitation collective ou qui sont essentielles au fonctionnement du système de soins de santé doivent prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR. Toutes les autres personnes doivent demander un test de dépistage rapide. Les personnes qui reçoivent un résultat positif à un test de dépistage rapide peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR pour confirmer le résultat.

Les gens devraient avoir à la maison une trousse de test de dépistage rapide au cas où ils en auraient besoin. Le dépistage rapide peut aider à protéger les gens qui présentent un risque accru de maladie grave, comme les personnes âgées ou immunodéficientes.  C’est pourquoi les tests de dépistage rapide continuent d’être distribués dans les écoles, et ils sont disponibles à de nombreux endroits dans les localités.

Les personnes qui reçoivent un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19 devront toujours s’isoler pendant sept jours à partir de la date où les symptômes sont apparus, ou à partir de la date de réception d’un résultat positif au dépistage s’il n’y a pas de symptômes. Il n’est pas nécessaire d’aviser les personnes avec lesquelles vous avez eu des contacts, sauf les personnes de votre ménage, mais on encourage quand même les gens à le faire, surtout pour celles qui courent un risque accru de maladie. Les personnes avec qui vous avez eu des contacts n’ont pas besoin de s’isoler tant qu’elles n’ont pas de symptômes et qu’elles obtiennent un résultat négatif au dépistage, qu’elles vivent ou non avec la personne qui a eu un résultat positif au test de dépistage. 


Faits en bref
-- L’état d’urgence en Nouvelle-Écosse prend fin le dimanche 20 mars à 23 h 59.
-- Le port du masque sera maintenu dans les milieux à risque élevé, notamment les hôpitaux, les établissements de soins de longue durée, les établissements exploités par le ministère des Services communautaires, dans le cas des services de soins à domicile et dans les prisons provinciales.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Phase 3 Begins March 21; Masks to Stay in Schools","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Phase 3 Begins March 21; Masks to Stay in Schools 
--------------------------------------------------------
On March 21, most province-wide public health restrictions will be lifted, including gathering limits, physical distancing and mask requirements. Some measures will remain in place for high-risk settings, such as healthcare and long-term care. 

In public schools, masking remains mandatory for a few more weeks. 

“I know there will be mixed emotions among students and parents about the decision to keep masks on for a little longer,” said Premier Tim Houston. “But when we have new information, we reassess. This week, eight of our province’s leading pediatric doctors spoke up. After speaking with Dr. (Robert) Strang and Dr. (Andrew) Lynk, and listening carefully, we felt this change made sense. For everyone else, you don’t need restrictions to keep wearing your mask and doing what makes sense to protect yourself and others.” 

Effective 12:01 a.m. Monday, March 21:
-- there will be no gathering limits or capacity limits, but people should still keep their social groups small and consistent and make careful choices about the gatherings they attend
-- physical distance will no longer be required between individuals and groups, although distancing is still recommended
-- masks will no longer be required, but wearing one in indoor public places or crowded outdoor places is strongly recommended
-- businesses and organizations across all sectors can resume full operations with no mandatory public health restrictions 
-- special events including festivals, sports, performances, meetings, training and faith ceremonies can resume in full.

“The pandemic isn’t over. COVID-19 is still in our communities and for some, it remains a deadly virus,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Most provincial restrictions are coming to an end but our healthy habits should not. You should still wear a mask when you’re out, get vaccinated, stay home when you’re sick, test to protect vulnerable people and keep your gatherings small. These individual actions, done in the spirit of kindness and community, will help keep us all safe.” 

In public schools, staff and students will follow the updated guidance in the Back to School Plan, including the following:
-- masking for staff, students and visitors remains in place for a few more weeks during school hours and on school buses
-- visitors and spectators will need to wear masks in schools during school instructional hours for a few more weeks
-- staff and students are asked to follow core public health measures such as getting vaccinated if eligible, staying home if feeling unwell, following the COVID-19 daily checklist, washing and sanitizing hands frequently
-- music, band, arts and sports in schools can resume in full 
-- tournaments, concerts and extracurricular activities are permitted
-- planning for graduation can proceed.

More information is available at https://novascotia.ca/backtoschool

In long-term care facilities:
-- residents can have five visitors at a time if the facility can accommodate them
-- larger groups of visitors are permitted for special occasions like a resident’s birthday or anniversary if the facility can accommodate them
-- visitors need to wear a mask and be fully vaccinated, except for end-of-life visits
-- regardless of vaccination status, residents can leave the facility for any reason, including overnight visits with family.

The Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre will continue with mask requirements and visitor restrictions. 

Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 needs to self-isolate, complete the online self-assessment and book an appointment for testing. People who are at increased risk for severe disease, live in congregate settings or are integral to keeping our health system running are directed to book a PCR test. Everyone else is directed to use rapid tests. People who test positive on a rapid test can book a PCR test to confirm the result.

People should keep a rapid test kit at home in case they need it. Rapid testing can help protect people at increased risk of severe disease, such as people who are older or immunocompromised. Rapid tests continue to be distributed through schools for this purpose and are available in many community locations.

People who test positive for COVID-19 will still be required to self-isolate for seven days from the date symptoms started, or from the date of a positive test if there are no symptoms. There is no requirement to notify contacts outside a person’s household but people are encouraged to do so, especially for those who are at increased risk. Contacts are not required to isolate as long as they are symptom-free and test negative, whether they live with the person who tested positive or not.


Quick Facts:
-- the state of emergency in Nova Scotia ends on Sunday, March 20, at 11:59 p.m.
-- masking will continue in high-risk settings, including hospitals, long-term care facilities, facilities operated by Department of Community Services, home care and provincial jails; public service staff are encouraged to wear masks

"Public Works","Study Recommends Options to Protect National Trade Corridor","PUBLIC WORKS--Study Recommends Options to Protect National Trade Corridor
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A transportation study has recommended three options to help preserve the flow of goods and services between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 

About $35 billion in trade is conducted via the Chignecto Isthmus each year.

“We now have three well-considered options for protecting the critical transportation infrastructure on the Chignecto Isthmus, as well as agricultural land and, most importantly, local communities,” said Nova Scotia Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “This study will help guide our decisions.”

The options outlined in the study are:
-- raising the existing dikes
-- building new dikes
-- raising the existing dikes and installing steel sheet pile walls at select locations. 

“Work on the Chignecto Isthmus Climate Change Adaptation Engineering and Feasibility Study started in 2018, and collaboration between New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the federal government was key to ensuring this vital economic link between both provinces remains protected,” said New Brunswick Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Jill Green. “Not only will this ensure the continuation of the trade corridor, but it should provide additional protection for residents in Sackville and surrounding areas.” 

The two provinces will decide on a course of action after discussing these options with the federal government. The cost of each option ranges from about $190 million to more than $300 million.

Le rapport épidémiologique sur la COVID-19 indique cette semaine que le virus est toujours présent et qu’il continue d’y avoir transmission communautaire. Le nombre de nouvelles hospitalisations demeure élevé. L’âge et le profil vaccinal continuent d’être les deux grands indicateurs de maladie grave et de décès liés à la COVID-19.
 
« Ce que nous voyons dans le rapport de cette semaine n’est pas inattendu. La pandémie n’est pas finie, et nous pouvons le constater en voyant le nombre de résultats positifs en laboratoire et tout particulièrement le nombre d’hospitalisations, a souligné le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef. Nous commençons tout juste à voir les effets de la première phase de notre plan de reprise des activités. Nous en sommes à un point critique puisque la phase trois commencera dans quelques jours. Il est plus important que jamais de poser les gestes qui nous protégerons tous, et nous connaissons ces gestes. Faites-vous vacciner. Obtenez votre dose de rappel si vous y êtes admissible. Portez le masque. Limitez le nombre de personnes – toujours les mêmes – dans vos cercles sociaux. Restez à la maison si vous êtes malade et passez un test de dépistage pour protéger les gens que vous aimez. »

This week’s COVID-19 epidemiology report reflects continued virus activity and community spread. The number of new hospital admissions remains high. Age and vaccination status continue to be the two strongest indicators of severe disease and death from COVID-19.
 
“What we’re seeing in this week’s report is not unexpected. The pandemic is not over – and you can see that when you look at positive lab tests and hospitalizations in particular,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We are just now starting to see the impact of phase one of our reopening plan. We are at a critical period with phase three just days away. It is more important than ever to do the things we know will keep ourselves and others safe. Get vaccinated. Get boosted if you’re eligible. Wear your mask. Keep your social circles small and consistent. Stay home if you’re sick, and test to protect the people you love.”
 
From March 9 to March 15, 2022:
-- there were 2,888 positive PCR tests performed at the lab
-- there were 41 new hospital admissions due to COVID-19 and 23 discharges
-- there were 15 COVID-19 deaths reported in Panorama during this period. 

As of March 17, 2022: 
-- there are 38 people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 with a median age of 66
-- of the current hospitalizations, 23.7 per cent were partially or unvaccinated
-- the median age of COVID-19 reported deaths since the start of the Omicron wave (December 8, 2021) was 79 years and 24 per cent were partially or unvaccinated; this can be compared to the median age of COVID-19 cases, which was 40 years
-- as of March 15, 2022, 87.1 per cent of Nova Scotians are fully vaccinated, 5.1 per cent are partially vaccinated, and 7.8 per cent are unvaccinated
-- as of March 15, 2022, 63.2 of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose.
 
New information has been added to the public dashboard this week, including epidemiology curves that show wave five trends in positive tests, hospitalizations, and vaccination. Weekly reporting is expected to evolve over the next several weeks. Future updates will be included in the weekly news release.

"Environment and Climate Change","Bilan des consultations sur la protection du littoral","ENVIRONNEMENT ET CHANGEMENT CLIMATIQUE-- Bilan des consultations sur la protection du littoral
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont soumis leurs commentaires au sujet du règlement proposé qui contribuera à protéger le littoral de la province, ainsi que les nouvelles constructions près du littoral, contre les dommages causés par le changement climatique.

Plus de 230 soumissions ont été reçues dans le cadre de la consultation sur le règlement en vertu de la loi sur la protection du littoral (Coastal Protection Act), qui a eu lieu l'année dernière. Un aperçu des commentaires du public, des municipalités, des industries de l'immobilier et de l'assurance, et des organismes de génie professionnel, d'arpentage et d'urbanisme se trouve au https://novascotia.ca/coast/fr.

La consultation avec les Mi'kmaq se poursuit.

« Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse voient les effets du changement climatique chaque jour, et notre littoral se trouve en première ligne. Nous devons travailler ensemble pour protéger notre littoral et les nouvelles constructions près du littoral contre l'érosion accrue, les inondations côtières et les ondes de tempête que le changement climatique continuera de causer, affirme Timothy Halman, ministre de l'Environnement et du Changement climatique. La loi sur la protection du littoral et son règlement, avec la loi sur les objectifs environnementaux et la réduction du changement climatique et le plan climatique qui sera publié sous peu, nous offre le plan et les outils nécessaires pour nous adapter aux impacts du changement climatique, pour atténuer ces impacts, et pour assurer un avenir sain et viable pour notre province. Je remercie toutes les personnes qui ont pris le temps de soumettre leurs points de vue au sujet du règlement proposé. »

La loi sur la protection du littoral crée des zones protégées, et le règlement établira les règles et les exigences qui s'appliquent aux nouvelles constructions dans ces zones, y compris la distance minimale entre l'eau et les édifices.

Au cours des prochains mois, le Ministère continuera de collaborer avec les municipalités, les associations qui réglementent les arpenteurs, les ingénieurs et les géoscientifiques en Nouvelle-Écosse, ainsi que les Mi'kmaq pour rédiger la version définitive du règlement. L'objectif est d'assurer l'entrée en vigueur du règlement et de la loi (qui n'a pas encore été proclamée) en 2023.

« Dans notre région côtière, nous voyons les effets du changement climatique tous les jours. Les décisions que nous prenons doivent tenir compte de cette réalité et doivent pouvoir être adaptées aux conséquences parfois dangereuses et destructives. Le gouvernement provincial a considéré nos préoccupations à cet égard, et nous accueillons favorablement les prochaines étapes vers un règlement qui protégera nos communautés et les personnes qui y résident. »
     - Amanda McDougall, mairesse de la Municipalité régionale du Cap-Breton

« Le Bureau d'assurance du Canada appuie avec enthousiasme le travail du gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse envers la création d'un règlement pour la mise en oeuvre de la nouvelle loi sur la protection du littoral. Les régions côtières de la Nouvelle-Écosse font partie intégrante du développement de la province. Il est important pour notre avenir qu'un plan soit mis en place pour nous permettre de nous adapter à la réalité du changement climatique et de l'élévation du niveau de la mer. L'industrie de l'assurance biens et de l'assurance risques divers a été témoin d'une augmentation inquiétante des dommages causés par le temps violent au cours de la dernière décennie, ce qui entraîne des réclamations de plus en plus élevées. Les propriétés côtières sont devenues particulièrement vulnérables aux dommages. Lorsque les propriétaires ne peuvent pas compter sur leur assurance après un phénomène météorologique violent, ils s'attendent à pouvoir participer aux programmes provinciaux d'aide en cas de catastrophe, que nous finançons tous à titre de contribuables. Bien que la décision de restreindre l'utilisation des zones côtières vulnérables puisse être difficile, la protection du littoral de la Nouvelle-Écosse est nécessaire, à la fois pour notre bien-être financier et pour l'environnement. Nous ne pouvons plus attendre pour agir. Les raisons financières sont claires, mais avant tout il s'agit d'un pas important vers la protection de la sécurité et du bien-être des gens qui vivent, travaillent et s'amusent sur le littoral. »
     - Amanda Dean, vice-présidente pour la région Atlantique, Bureau d'assurance du Canada

Faits en bref
-- La majorité du littoral de la province, qui mesure 13 000 kilomètres, est vulnérable aux impacts néfastes du changement climatique, et dans de nombreuses régions, les inondations côtières et l'érosion menacent déjà les maisons, les chalets et les entreprises.
-- La loi sur la protection du littoral, adoptée en 2019, établi clairement les règles visant à protéger le littoral de la Nouvelle-Écosse contre les effets du changement climatique et assure la protection des nouvelles maisons et entreprises contre l'élévation du niveau de la mer, les inondations côtières et l'érosion.
-- La loi ne s'applique pas aux maisons et aux édifices existants dans les régions côtières, sauf si le propriétaire prévoit d'agrandir ou de reconstruire.
-- Le gouvernement a adopté la loi sur les objectifs environnementaux et la réduction du changement climatique (Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act) à l'automne 2021.
-- Le plan climatique sera publié au printemps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians have shared their input on the proposed regulations which will help protect the province’s coastline, and new construction on it, from the damaging impacts of climate change.

More than 230 submissions were received during last year’s consultation on regulations under the Coastal Protection Act. An overview of the feedback, from the public, municipalities, the real estate and insurance industries, and professional engineering, land surveying and planning organizations, is available at: https://novascotia.ca/coast/ 

 Consultation with the Mi’kmaq remains ongoing.

“Nova Scotians are experiencing the impacts of climate change every day, and our coastline is literally on the frontline. We must work together to protect our coastline, and new construction along it, from the increased erosion, coastal flooding and tidal surges that climate change will continue to bring,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “The Coastal Protection Act and its regulations, along with the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act and the upcoming climate plan, will give us the action plan and tools we need to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, and ensure a healthy and sustainable future for our province. I want to thank all those took the time to provide input on the proposed regulations.”

The Coastal Protection Act creates protection zones and the regulations will set the rules and requirements for new construction in these zones, including the minimum distance from the water.

The Department will continue to work with municipalities, the Association of Nova Scotia Land Surveyors, Engineers Nova Scotia, Geoscientists Nova Scotia and the Mi’kmaq in the coming months as it finalizes the regulations. The goal is to have the regulations and the act, which is not yet proclaimed, take effect in 2023.

Quotes:
“As a coastal region, we see the effects of climate change every day. The decisions we make need to consider this reality and be adaptive to the sometimes dangerous and destructive outcomes. The provincial government has listened to the voices of concern on these issues, and we welcome the next steps toward regulations that will protect our communities and residents.”
     - Amanda McDougall, Mayor, Cape Breton Regional Municipality

“The Insurance Bureau of Canada enthusiastically supports the Government of Nova Scotia’s work towards creating regulations to enable the new Coastal Protection Act.  Nova Scotia’s coastal areas have been an integral part of the development of the province. It is important to our future that a plan is put in place to adapt to the reality of climate change and rising sea levels. The property and casualty insurance industry has observed an alarming increase in damage from severe weather over the last decade through increasing claims amounts. Coastal properties have become especially vulnerable to damage. When insurance is not available following a severe weather event, property owners may expect to draw on provincial disaster relief programs, which we all pay for through our taxes. While the decision to restrict the use of vulnerable coastal properties may be difficult, protecting Nova Scotia’s coastline is the right thing to do, both for our financial well-being and for the environment. We simply can’t wait any longer to act. The financial case is clear, but more importantly this is an important step forward to protect is the safety and well-being of people who live, work, and play along the coastline.”
     - Amanda Dean, Vice-President, Atlantic, Insurance Bureau of Canada

Quick Facts:
-- most of the province’s 13,000 kilometres of coastline is vulnerable to the harmful impacts of climate change and many areas are already experiencing coastal flooding or facing erosion that threatens homes, cottages and businesses
-- the Coastal Protection Act, passed in April 2019, sets out clear rules to protect Nova Scotia’s coastline from the impact of climate change and ensure new homes and businesses are safer from sea-level rise and coastal flooding and erosion
-- the legislation does not apply to existing coastal homes and buildings, unless the owner intends to expand or rebuild
-- the government passed the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act in fall 2021
-- the climate plan will be launched this spring

The government is investing $1.3 million in new hearing and speech technology that will benefit newborns, children and other Nova Scotians.

The funding for Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia includes:
-- $982,000 to replace cochlear implant devices, which expire over time and are no longer supported by manufacturers
-- $322,000 for new equipment for screening newborns’ hearing
-- $11,400 to replace a nasometer, which is a device used to assess and treat nasality problems associated with cleft palate, oral cancer and other disorders or injuries of the palate.

“Hearing and speech is important for overall health and well-being,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “If we can help prevent future issues in our newborns through early detection and up-to-date technology, then we’re ensuring a healthier future for all Nova Scotians.”

Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia’s Newborn Screening Program consistently screens over 95 per cent of newborns in Nova Scotia annually. Each baby’s ears are checked to see if the inner ear is healthy, and follow-up is arranged if needed. Identifying hearing issues early in infancy helps prevent future hearing and speech issues in childhood.

Quotes:
“This funding for equipment and technology upgrades will help ensure Nova Scotians get the meaningful high-quality services they need. All Nova Scotians benefit from early detection and intervention using up-to-date technology. For children, this equipment is important for prevention of delays in speech, language and early social development.”
     - Anne Mason-Browne, CEO, Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- in 2020, Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia provided hearing screening to 7,390 newborns and supported 325 clients with cochlear implants

"Justice","Des changements à la loi sur le rôle parental et les pensions alimentaires renforcent le droit de la famille","JUSTICE-- Des changements à la loi sur le rôle parental et les pensions alimentaires renforcent le droit de la famille
----------------------------------------------------------------
Des changements législatifs visant à mieux aider les familles qui vivent une séparation entreront en vigueur le 1er avril.

Les modifications à la loi sur le rôle parental et les pensions alimentaires (Parenting and Support Act), adoptées lors de la séance du printemps 2021 de l'Assemblée législative, clarifient la loi provinciale et correspondent aux modifications apportées à la Loi sur le divorce du gouvernement fédéral. Les modifications provinciales mettent à jour le langage utilisé, décrivent les devoirs des parents et offrent des conseils et des renseignements supplémentaires aux tribunaux. 

« Ces modifications permettent d'harmoniser la loi fédérale et la loi provinciale et appuient notre objectif visant à améliorer l'accès à la justice, souligne Brad Johns, procureur général et ministre de la Justice. Les changements offrent une certaine uniformité pour les familles et protègent mieux l'intérêt supérieur des enfants. »

Les modifications aux lignes directrices provinciales sur les pensions alimentaires pour enfants entreront également en vigueur le 1er avril, conformément aux changements récents apportés à la loi fédérale sur le divorce et à la loi provinciale sur le rôle parental et les pensions alimentaires. Les lignes directrices révisées aideront les familles à mieux s'y retrouver dans le système du droit de la famille. 

Les procédures de mariage et de divorce relèvent de la compétence exclusive du gouvernement fédéral, alors que les prestations alimentaires matrimoniales et pour enfants, la division des biens, la garde et l'accès, et la protection de l'enfance relèvent de la compétence des provinces. Chaque domaine est régi par une loi différente. 

Les changements permettront :
-- de mettre à jour le langage utilisé dans la loi afin d'appuyer les ententes parentales positives en remplaçant le terme « garde » (custody) par des termes tels que « temps parental » ou « responsabilité de prise de décisions »;
-- clarifier que la responsabilité de prise de décisions quotidiennes relève de la personne qui passe du temps parental avec l'enfant, sauf si un tribunal n'en décide autrement;
-- décrire les devoirs des parents qui portent une affaire devant le tribunal, y compris le devoir de protéger leurs enfants contre les effets nuisibles du conflit;
-- de faire en sorte que les juges disposent des renseignements nécessaires pour prendre des décisions concernant les ententes parentales et d'exiger qu'ils considèrent toute procédure, ordonnance, condition ou mesure (d'un tribunal civil ou pénal) qui est pertinente pour la sécurité de l'enfant, afin de permettre aux tribunaux de comprendre les questions de violence familiale et de mieux protéger les enfants;
-- de clarifier le processus juridique pour un parent qui souhaite déménager avec son enfant, pour faire en sorte que l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant soit le point principal à considérer.

Faits en bref
-- La loi modifiée sur le rôle parental et les pensions alimentaires (Parenting and Support Act) entrera en vigueur à sa proclamation le 1er avril 2022.
-- Les modifications récentes à la Loi fédérale sur le divorce sont entrées en vigueur le 1er mars 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislative changes to better support families dealing with family separation will come into effect on April 1.

The amendments to the Parenting and Support Act, passed during the spring 2021 sitting of the legislature, provide clarity and bring the provincial legislation in line with amendments to the federal Divorce Act. The provincial changes update language, describe the duties of parents and give additional guidance and information to the courts. 

“These changes harmonize the federal and provincial legislation and support our goal of improving access to justice,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Brad Johns. “The improvements provide consistency to families and better support the best interests of their children.”

Amendments to the Provincial Child Support Guidelines will also come into effect on April 1. These are also more closely aligned with recent changes to the federal Divorce Act and the provincial Parenting and Support Act. The revised guidelines will help families better navigate the family justice system. 

The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over marriage and divorce proceedings, while provinces have jurisdiction over spousal and child support, property division, custody and access, and child protection. Each area is administered by separate pieces of legislation. 

The changes will:
-- update language in the act to support positive parenting arrangements by replacing the word “custody” with terms such as “parenting time” and “decision-making responsibility”
-- make it clear that the day-to-day decision-making responsibility rests with the person who is exercising parenting time, unless a court orders otherwise
-- describe the duties of parents who have a matter before the courts, including the duty to protect their children from the harmful effects of conflict
-- help make sure judges have the information they need to make decisions about parenting arrangements and require them to consider any civil or criminal proceeding, order, condition or measure that is relevant to the safety of the child; this will help courts deal with family violence issues more clearly and better protect children
-- clarify the legal process when a parent wants to relocate with their child, ensuring the best interests of the child is the main consideration.

Quick Facts:
-- the amended Parenting and Support Act will come into effect upon proclamation on April 1
-- recent amendments to the federal Divorce Act took effect on March 1, 2021

La Province crée une nouvelle table de consultation sur la petite enfance et invite les personnes intéressées à présenter une demande pour devenir membres.

La table de consultation sur la petite enfance offrira des suggestions et des conseils à la ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance de la Nouvelle-Écosse en ce qui a trait à la mise en oeuvre de l'Accord entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada. La table sera formée de 10 à 18 membres et inclura des personnes qui travaillent dans le secteur, des exploitants de services de garde d'enfants, des parents et autres.

« Nous avons cinq ans pour transformer la façon donc les services de garde d'enfants sont offerts en Nouvelle-Écosse, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Nous devons travailler en collaboration avec les gens qui connaissent le secteur et qui offrent les services tous les jours, ainsi qu'avec les familles qui utilisent ces services. Nous avons besoin de gens qui peuvent nous aider à créer un système de garde d'enfants qui fonctionne pour tous, c'est-à-dire pour les enfants, les familles, les éducatrices de la petite enfance et les exploitants. »

Si vous souhaitez devenir membre de la table de consultation, veuillez soumettre votre demande en ligne au plus tard le 8 avril en consultant le https://www.ednet.ns.ca/childcare .

Les membres seront annoncés en mai. Toute autre personne qui souhaite participer aura l'occasion de soumettre ses suggestions et commentaires lors de séances de groupes de travail sur différents sujets, de groupes de discussion et de sondages.

Il a été annoncé en janvier que grâce à l'Accord entre le Canada et la Nouvelle-Écosse sur l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada, les familles néo-écossaises pourront profiter d'une réduction moyenne de 25 % des frais de services agréés de garde d'enfants à compter du 1er avril. Cette réduction sera rétroactive au 1er janvier 2022. Les familles qui ont un tout-petit pourraient économiser en moyenne 200 $ par mois grâce à cette réduction. Il s'agit de la première étape dans la réduction des frais de garde d'enfants de 2019 de 50 %, en moyenne, d'ici la fin de l'année 2022, et d'un pas vers l'atteinte de l'objectif d'offrir des frais de 10 $ par jour d'ici au 31 mars 2026.

Les efforts se poursuivent en ce qui a trait à la stratégie de la Nouvelle-Écosse « Excellence dans l'éducation de la petite enfance », qui entraînera une augmentation des salaires et des avantages sociaux pour les éducatrices de la petite enfance dès l'automne.

Citation
« Chaque enfant mérite le meilleur départ dans la vie. L'annonce effectuée aujourd'hui en Nouvelle-Écosse est un autre pas important dans la collaboration visant à renforcer notre système d'apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada, ce qui permettra à un plus grand nombre d'enfants et de familles d'avoir accès à des services abordables, flexibles et de qualité supérieure pour l'apprentissage et la garde des jeunes enfants. »
     - Karina Gould, ministre fédérale de la Famille, des Enfants et du Développement social

"Environment and Climate Change","Province Invests in Energy Efficiency, Low-carbon Economy","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Province Invests in Energy Efficiency, Low-carbon Economy
--------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing $9 million in six projects that support energy efficiency and the transition to a low-carbon economy.

These investments from the Green Fund support goals enshrined in the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 53 per cent from 2005 levels, generate 80 per cent of electricity from renewable sources, and reach 30 per cent electric vehicle sales, all by 2030.

“Nova Scotians want us to take action to address the climate emergency and adapt to climate change,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “By helping Nova Scotians, businesses and industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are collectively doing our part to secure a more sustainable and cleaner future.”

The investments include $5.5 million for four programs by Efficiency One, the non-profit administrator of Efficiency Nova Scotia:
-- $1.5 million for three years for the Off-oil Retrofit Incentive Pilot, which requires all oil heating equipment and the oil tank to be removed and replaced with an electric-based heating system
-- $1.5 million for three years to expand the Industrial On-site Energy Manager Program, which provides energy management support, to include larger electricity consumers
-- $1.5 million for two years for the SolarHomes for Not-for-profits Program to expand rebate eligibility to include churches, food banks and other registered non-profit organizations
-- $1 million for two years for the Apartment and Condo Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Program to provide incentives for installing smart charging stations in new and existing condominiums and apartments.

There is also $3.5 million for two programs administered by the Clean Foundation:
-- $2 million for three years to extend the Black, Indigenous, People of Colour (BIPOC) and Mi’kmaq Energy Training Pilot, which was launched in 2021 and trains people from under-represented groups to become energy advisors and clean energy tradespeople
-- $1.5 million for three years for the Next Ride Electric Vehicle Engagement Campaign Program that allows people across the province to learn about and test drive an electric vehicle.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotia is committed to having 80 per cent of our electricity needs filled by renewable energy by 2030. We’re pleased to see programs that help with things like upgrading buildings to become more energy efficient, reducing energy bills and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These changes together will help us get to where we need to be.”
     - Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables

“Clean Foundation is pleased to be a recipient of these Green Fund investments. They will support Nova Scotia’s transition to a low-carbon economy through education on electrified transportation and by creating a career path in the energy efficiency industry for participants from racialized and Indigenous communities.”
     - Scott Skinner, President and CEO, Clean Foundation

Quick Facts:
-- the Green Fund is revenue collected under the Province’s cap-and-trade program
-- companies in the program that do not reduce their greenhouse gas emissions must buy allowances at auction, with that money set aside to be reinvested in climate change initiatives
-- auctions in 2021-22 raised $44.9 million
-- this is the last installment from the $44.9 million for this fiscal year

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Province Seeking Input on Child Care Transformation","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Province Seeking Input on Child Care Transformation
--------------------------------------------------------
The Province is creating a new engagement table on child care and inviting interested Nova Scotians to apply to be members.

The Early Learning and Child Care Engagement Table will provide input and advice to Nova Scotia’s Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development around implementing the Canada Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement. The table will have 10 to 18 members and include people who work in the sector, operators, parents and others.

“We are on a five-year journey to transform the way child care is delivered in Nova Scotia,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “We need to work together with the people who know the sector, deliver care on a day-to-day basis, and the families who access care. We need people who can help us build child care that cares for all Nova Scotians – children, families, early childhood educators, operators.”

Those interested in being a member of the engagement table are encouraged to submit an application by April 8, using the online form at: https://www.ednet.ns.ca/childcare

Table members will be announced in May. Other people who would like to be involved will still have opportunities to provide input, including through working groups on specific topics, focus groups and surveys.

As announced in January, through the Canada Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, families in Nova Scotia will see a 25 per cent reduction, on average, in child-care fees as of April 1, retroactive to January 1, 2022, for children in regulated child-care spaces. This reduction means a savings, on average, of $200 per month for parents with a toddler in child care. This is an initial step in reducing 2019 child-care fees for Nova Scotian families by 50 per cent, on average, by the end of 2022, and in achieving an average of $10-a-day care by March 31, 2026.

Work continues on Nova Scotia’s Excellence in Early Childhood Education workforce strategy, which will result in higher wages and benefits for early childhood educators by this fall.

Quotes:
“Every child deserves the best start in life. Today’s announcement in Nova Scotia is another meaningful step in working together to grow our Canada-wide early learning and child-care system, allowing more children and families to access high-quality, affordable, flexible and inclusive early learning and child care.”

"Environment and Climate Change","Terms of Reference for Environmental Assessment Process Sent to Northern Pulp","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Terms of Reference for Environmental Assessment Process Sent to Northern Pulp
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The terms of reference that Northern Pulp will use to prepare its environmental assessment for its proposed mill revitalization and new pulp effluent treatment plant were sent to the company today, March 14.

The environmental assessment is required to have a description of the company’s planned project in Pictou County, identify all potential environmental risks and impacts, and outline a plan to mitigate those risks and impacts.

The company has until March 14, 2024, to submit its environmental assessment, addressing all requirements in the terms of reference, to the Department of Environment and Climate Change.

When the Department receives the environmental assessment, the next steps in this legislated process are:
-- the Minister refers the report to an independent, appointed environmental assessment review panel; the work of the panel is guided by the science and evidence presented through the environmental assessment process
-- the panel oversees a review of the report that includes input from the public, the Mi’kmaq and government reviewers, and it can include public hearings 
-- after the public review, the panel prepares a report and recommendation to the Minister, who then decides to either approve or reject the project
-- if the project is approved, a company can then decide to proceed to the Industrial Approval application phase and apply for a permit to construct and operate
-- emission and effluent conditions are set during the industrial approval stage, after a company has first identified all possible risks and impacts to the environment and prepared a mitigation plan to ensure the local environment can handle any changes that might happen as a result of the project.

The final terms of reference and the comments received from Northern Pulp, the Mi’kmaq, stakeholders and the public on the draft version are available at: https://www.novascotia.ca/nse/ea/mill-transformation-and-effluent-treatment-facility/ 

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia’s legislated environmental assessment process balances economic development with protection of the environment; all companies that choose to operate in Nova Scotia follow the same process
-- on July 15, 2021, the Province announced that Northern Pulp’s mill revitalization and effluent treatment plant project must undergo a Class II environmental assessment
-- the company registered the project for a Class II environmental assessment for on December 7, 2021
-- public consultation on the draft terms of reference ran from December 21, 2021, to January 31, 2022; only comments relevant to the scope of the terms of reference as set out in the Environment Act regulations are considered during this process – it is not a consensus-based or public opinion process
-- the company’s new proposal involves changes to the pulp mill itself, as well as the design and construction of a new effluent treatment plant

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Funding for Community Projects that Help Older Nova Scotians Stay Healthy, Active","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Funding for Community Projects that Help Older Nova Scotians Stay Healthy, Active
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing just over $600,000 in projects to help older Nova Scotians stay healthy, active and socially connected in their communities.

Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams announced today, March 14, that 39 projects led by organizations throughout Nova Scotia are receiving grants through the Age-Friendly Communities Grant Program.

“Community organizations like those receiving support through the Age-Friendly Communities Grant Program make a real difference in the lives of older Nova Scotians, providing important connections to people and services in their communities,” said Minister Adams. “These connections and activities have been especially critical during the past two years of the pandemic.”

One of the recipients is March of Dimes Canada, which was awarded a grant of $25,000 to help expand its After Stroke program in Nova Scotia. This personalized stroke recovery program supports stroke survivors and their families as they make the transition from hospital to home, providing education and opportunities to participate in their community.

Some of the projects receiving grants this year are aimed at helping seniors overcome social isolation and loneliness during the pandemic, while others provide opportunities for seniors to learn new hobbies and skills; participate in physical, educational and social activities; and connect with people of all ages and services in their communities.

Quotes:
“We know that stroke survivors and their families across Nova Scotia need support. We are grateful to receive these funds, which give us the opportunity to expand our After Stroke program across the province – making our personalized stroke recovery services available no matter where survivors live and what stage of recovery they are in.”
     - Rebecca Bourbonnais, Regional Manager, Community Programs and After Stroke, March of Dimes Canada

“Community organizations like March of Dimes Canada have a unique role to play in bringing care closer to home for Nova Scotians. Our After Stroke program tailors this care to the individual needs of each person, recognizing the many things that can contribute to someone’s wellness.”
     - Dr. Michelle L.A. Nelson, Chief Knowledge and Innovation Officer, March of Dimes Canada

“I understand the need of talking with others who have been in similar situations to see the path forward and to understand that there is still hope. I became involved in the community programs with March of Dimes Canada a couple years after my stroke and saw great improvements. I am now trained to be a peer volunteer so I can share my story and offer the help to others.”
     - Rannveig Yeatman, stroke survivor

Quick Facts: 
-- the Age-Friendly Communities Grant Program provides grants of up to $25,000 for community-wide efforts to create age-friendly environments and promote healthy aging
-- groups eligible to apply include not-for-profit organizations and co-operatives, municipalities, First Nations communities and universities 
-- grants are awarded annually 
-- since 2017, the program has supported 183 projects, providing more than $2.1 million in total funding

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Funding to Help Seniors Stay at Home Longer, Make Workplaces Safer","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Funding to Help Seniors Stay at Home Longer, Make Workplaces Safer 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing over $500,000 in new equipment to support seniors and people caring for them at home and in long-term care facilities.

The Canadian Red Cross in Nova Scotia will receive $266,000 to purchase 56 hospital beds and 35 bariatric beds, expanding the Community Bed Loan Program. The program provides specialized beds to eligible Nova Scotians who need them in their homes, improving safety and in some cases, helping people get home from the hospital sooner.

“The Red Cross is always there to respond when we need them and help make sure Nova Scotians live safer, fuller lives,” said Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams. “Expanding this program will give many more older Nova Scotians the care they need while living in their homes longer so they can be closer to their friends and family.” 

This investment is in addition to the regular funding support for the bed loan program.

The government will also fund 66 new portable lifts to help long-term care workers move residents more safely. The cost is $264,000.

Quotes:
“Our support for the provincial bed loan program will help more seniors remain in their homes. We know that many seniors face social isolation, especially during lengthy hospital stays, and this program will allow seniors to age in their own communities, staying closer to their loved ones.”
     - Darren Fisher, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Seniors and Member of Parliament for Dartmouth-Cole Harbour

“The bed loan program is a hidden gem, with most Nova Scotians unaware of our provincewide network of depots, technicians and vehicles that maintain, deliver, install and pick up home-use hospital beds. This program often shortens or avoids a patient’s hospital stay and helps ensure greater safety in their home.”
     - Christina Baert-Wilson, Provincial Director, Nova Scotia, Canadian Red Cross

Quick Facts:
-- the funding is through the Canada-Nova Scotia Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement 
-- in February, the Canadian Red Cross provided staffing support to long-term care facilities in Nova Scotia after an emergency request for federal assistance

The government is offering a reward of up to $150,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the disappearance of Matthew Simon Harrie.

On September 26, 2020, the RCMP initiated a missing person investigation after family members had no contact with Mr. Harrie for several weeks. Mr. Harrie was 35 years old at the time of his disappearance.  

He was last seen outside his home in Wittenburg, Colchester County, on September 20, 2020. He has not been seen by family or friends since that time and has not had contact with anyone, including his parents, who he spoke with regularly. 

Investigators believe people have information that could result in locating Mr. Harrie. 

“When a loved one goes missing, it has ripple effects throughout the community,” said Justice Minister Brad Johns. “I urge you to come forward if you think you have information that might help solve this missing person case.” 

Anyone with information regarding the missing person case of Matthew Simon Harrie should call the Rewards for Major Unsolved Crimes Program at 1-888-710-9090.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Interdictions de brûlage à compter du 15 mars","RESSOURCES NATURELLES ET ÉNERGIES RENOUVELABLES--Interdictions de brûlage à compter du 15 mars
----------------------------------------------------------------
À l'approche du printemps, le temps plus chaud et plus sec fait grimper le risque de feux de forêt ou de brousailles. En 2021, les pompiers de la province ont lutté contre 113 feux sur 197 hectares partout en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Les restrictions provinciales sur le brûlage entrent en vigueur le mardi 15 mars.

« À titre d'ancien chef de service d'incendie municipal, je sais que la prévention est la meilleure façon de réduire le risque de feu de forêt. Les restrictions sont en place pour assurer la sécurité de nos maisons et de nos communautés. Il est seulement permis de faire un feu lorsque le risque est le plus faible possible, affirme Tory Rushton, ministre des Ressources naturelles et des Énergies renouvelables. J'encourage tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à consulter la carte avant d'allumer un feu et d'adopter des pratiques responsables pour les feux extérieurs. »

La carte BurnSafe est mise à jour à 14 h tous les jours pour indiquer si les feux sont permis. Les restrictions sont indiquées de la façon suivante :
-- Si un comté apparaît en vert, les feux sont permis après 14 h.
-- Si un comté apparaît en jaune, les feux sont permis après 19 h.
-- Si un comté apparaît en rouge, les feux sont interdits.

La carte sera de couleur grise entre 8 h et 14 h tous les jours indiquant que les feux sont interdits en Nouvelle-Écosse.

La carte en ligne montre les restrictions imposées concernant les feux de broussailles et les feux de camp. Les restrictions ne s'appliquent pas aux feux de camp sur les terrains de camping autorisés privés, municipaux ou provinciaux qui offrent l'équipement approprié.

Les interdictions de brûlage sont également fournies par message enregistré au numéro sans frais 1-855-564-2876 (BURN).

En cas d'urgence, tout feu de forêt peut être signalé au numéro 1-800-565-2224 ou au 911.

Faits en bref
-- Les restrictions sont en vigueur du 15 mars au 15 octobre, soit la période où le risque de feu de forêt est le plus élevé.
-- Les gens doivent également consulter les règlements de leur municipalité, puisqu'ils peuvent donner des directives différentes.
-- Chaque jour, les données sur la météo, la température et l'humidité sont recueillies dans plus de 30 stations à l'échelle de la province afin de calculer les risques et déterminer si des restrictions doivent être imposées.
-- Le brûlage industriel, qui inclut la préparation des terrains aux fins agricoles, la préparation des terrains de plus de deux hectares pour la culture des bleuets et les feux de broussailles de plus de deux mètres sur trois mètres, nécessite un permis du ministère des Ressources naturelles et des Énergies renouvelables.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Burn Restrictions Begin March 15","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Burn Restrictions Begin March 15
----------------------------------------------------------------
With spring approaching, the warmer and drier weather will increase the risk of wildfires. In 2021, provincial firefighters fought 113 wildfires covering 197 hectares across Nova Scotia.

Provincial burn restrictions come into effect Tuesday, March 15.

“As a former municipal fire chief, I know prevention is the best way to reduce the risk of wildfires. Restrictions are in place for the safety of our homes and communities. Burning is only permitted when it poses the lowest possible fire risk,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “I encourage all Nova Scotians to check before they burn and follow safe and responsible burning practices for outdoor fires.”

The BurnSafe map will be updated each day at 2 p.m. to show if burning is permitted that day. The burn restrictions will be indicated by the following:
-- if a county is shown in green, burning is permitted after 2 p.m.
-- if a county is shown in yellow, burning is permitted after 7 p.m.
-- if a county is shown in red, burning is not permitted that day.

The map will appear grey between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. each day to indicate burning is not permitted in Nova Scotia.

The BurnSafe map shows provincial restrictions, which cover domestic brush burning and campfires. Restrictions do not apply to campfires in licensed private, municipal or provincial campgrounds with proper campfire facilities.

Restrictions are also available by recorded message by calling the toll-free phone line at 1-855-564-2876 (BURN).

In an emergency, wildfires can be reported by calling 1-800-565-2224 or 911.

Quick Facts:
-- burn restrictions are in place each year from March 15 to October 15, when the risk of wildfires is highest
-- residents should check municipal bylaws before burning, as rules may vary
-- weather, temperature and humidity data are collected from more than 30 stations across the province daily to calculate fire risk and determine burning restrictions
-- industrial burning, which includes clearing agricultural land, clearing blueberry fields over two hectares in size, or burning brush piles larger than two by three metres, requires a permit from the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables

Alors que nous passons à la prochaine et dernière phase de notre plan de reprise des activités, nous devons maintenir nos saines habitudes que nous savons efficaces, comme rester à la maison si on est malade, se faire tester au besoin, limiter nos contacts étroits et porter un masque, particulièrement dans les lieux intérieurs. Ces gestes peuvent sembler petits, mais ils ont un impact considérable en ce qui a trait à la protection des personnes les plus vulnérables dans nos communautés. »

This week’s COVID-19 epidemiology report shows a continued downward trend on several key indicators, including hospitalizations and deaths. However, it also shows that the COVID-19 virus is still present in Nova Scotia communities.
 
“It’s encouraging to see a continued downward trend, but this week’s data report serves as an important reminder of just how much virus is still circulating out there,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “As we move into the next and final phase of our reopening plan, we need to continue to use the healthy habits we know are effective, like staying home when we’re sick, testing when we need to, limiting our number of close contacts and wearing a mask, particularly when in indoor spaces. These actions may seem small but have a significant impact when it comes to protecting those most vulnerable in our communities.”

--------------------------------------------------------
East Hants residents will be able to safely walk, roll, run or ride a bicycle around more of the community with new investments in its active transportation network.

The Province is contributing more than $560,000 for a project under the East Hants master plan for active transportation. The project includes new sidewalks, trails and supporting infrastructure along just over one kilometre of Highway 214 in Elmsdale.

“This clean transportation investment will establish an active transportation spine through East Hants,” said John MacDonald, MLA for Hants East, on behalf of Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “Investments like this and the commitment of local governments will advance our goal to complete core active transportation networks that are accessible for all ages and all abilities in 65 per cent of the province’s communities by 2030.”

The total cost of the project is $1.7 million. The federal government is investing over $680,000 through the Green Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program and the Municipality of the District of East Hants is contributing more than $450,000.

By encouraging more people to get active, this project is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about one thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next 30 years.

Quotes:
“As our communities in East Hants continue to grow, it is crucial to have active transportation infrastructure to keep us connected to the places where we gather. This project is about connecting residential communities to important services in the municipality while reducing emissions and fighting climate change.”
     - Kody Blois, Member of Parliament for Kings-Hants, on behalf of Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities

“This announcement is another positive step towards creating walkable and environmentally sustainable communities in East Hants. Highway 214 is a central corridor that provides connections between residential areas and business and recreation opportunities. We are pleased to see updates in this area that will address the growing needs of our community.”

"Office of Addictions and Mental Health","New Mental Health Day Hospital","ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--New Mental Health Day Hospital 
----------------------------------------------------------------
A new mental health hospital will offer day treatments for those in the Halifax area requiring intensive mental health supports. 

The province’s first mental health acute day hospital is scheduled to open in April. The hospital, which will be at the QEII Health Sciences Centre, will provide an additional point of care for local residents living with mental illness. Individuals in need of intensive treatment can attend the day hospital during the day and return home in the evening. 

“Nova Scotians living with mental illness need and deserve access to appropriate supports and treatments,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “For some people, the supports provided at a community mental health clinic aren’t enough, but intensive inpatient psychiatric care isn’t the answer. The day hospital will address this gap and ensure that people can get appropriate care while staying closely connected with their family and community.”

Those attending the hospital will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of mental health specialists, including a newly hired psychiatrist, nursing staff and social workers. The team will provide individual psychiatric treatments and therapeutic group programs. The hospital will operate seven days a week. It will have an initial capacity of up to 10 people a day and is expected to expand.

The day hospital will help to improve access to care for people experiencing intense psychiatric symptoms but who do not require 24-hour inpatient support. It will also help decrease the number of overnight hospital admissions, easing existing pressures on inpatient psychiatric units and within the broader healthcare system, without compromising patient care or clinical outcomes for people living with mental illness.   

Admissions will come through community mental health clinics and emergency departments. People discharged from inpatient psychiatric care may also be referred to the day hospital for follow-up care. 

Quotes:
“The new Mental Health Day Hospital will help close the gap between outpatient care and full inpatient hospital admission. It will help provide people living with mental illness access to the supports they need on their healing journey.”
     - Dr. Sanjana Sridharan, Head of Acute Consultation and Emergency Psychiatry, Mental Health and Addictions Program, Nova Scotia Health 

Quick Facts:
-- occupancy rates for inpatient psychiatry care in Central Zone regularly exceed 100 per cent, requiring resources to be diverted to other health zones
-- estimated costs for the day hospital are $360,000 in 2021-22, with an ongoing annual investment of $1 million
-- the day hospital will be located in the Abbie J. Lane Memorial Building of the QEII Health Sciences Centre
-- patients will attend for an average of two weeks

“Nova Scotia needs to have a strong pool of candidates who are of the highest integrity, exhibit professional excellence and reflect the wide diversity of this province,” said Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “I invite members of the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society who represent the best of Nova Scotia and who are interested in being judges to apply.”

The government recently revised its Provincial Judicial Appointments Guidelines, updating the process for appointing judges to the criminal court. The guidelines include a new independent advisory committee, which will recommend candidates to the minister of justice.

The seven-member advisory committee is chaired by retired Justice N.M. (Nick) Scaravelli.

The guidelines ensure that appointments to the bench continue to be based on merit and professional excellence. Gender, racial and cultural diversity, geographical representation and commitment to public service are among the criteria for the appointment of judges.

There are currently two vacancies on the provincial court.

Quick Facts:
-- the Provincial Judicial Appointments Guidelines have been in place since 1995 and were last amended on January 14
-- in 2016, an amendment reduced the number of years of experience in the legal profession required to apply from 15 to 10 years
-- the advisory committee is composed of three members of the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society, one sitting provincial court judge, two members of the public and a retired justice, who chairs the committee

"Premier's Office","Government Invests in Film Industry Growth","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Government Invests in Film Industry Growth
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing $23 million to help Nova Scotia’s film industry grow sustainably and generate economic activity year-round.

Premier Tim Houston announced today, March 8, two investments to support the industry:
-- $8 million toward a soundstage that will increase the industry’s capacity, create more jobs and allow productions to continue year-round
-- $15 million for a new Nova Scotia Content Creator Fund that will benefit local film and television productions.

The Premier and Screen Nova Scotia representatives will also travel to Los Angeles from March 12 to 16 to meet with decision-makers from Disney, Netflix, NBC Universal and other studios.

“Film is a crucial and growing part of Nova Scotia’s economy – creating jobs, bringing international investments and showing the world what Nova Scotia has to offer,” said Premier Houston. “These investments will help show international producers that Nova Scotia is a great place to film, while making sure local creators have the resources they need to thrive.”

The Nova Scotia Content Creator Fund will provide $3 million per year over five years to eligible Nova Scotia-led productions, supporting local directors, writers, actors and performers. Screen Nova Scotia will administer the fund and lead development of a 4,645 square-metre (50,000 sq. ft.) soundstage facility. The facility is expected to cost $20 million in total, with further support coming from other partners and private investors.

Quotes:
“This investment marks an exciting and pivotal moment in time for our sector. While our industry has worked hard to build back production volume in Nova Scotia over the past seven years, a soundstage and a content creator fund are two critical pieces of infrastructure that will propel us towards our full growth potential.”
     - Laura Mackenzie, Executive Director, Screen Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- the film industry contributed about $180.8 million to Nova Scotia’s economy in 2021-22, up from about $78 million in 2019-20 and about $91.6 million in 2020-21
-- the Province supported 82 projects through the Film and Television Production Incentive Fund in 2021-22
-- Premier Houston will also travel to Ottawa from March 9 to 11 to meet with officials from the United Kingdom and the European Union on trade, tourism and economic opportunities before travelling on to Los Angeles

Nova Scotia communities are pursuing clean energy projects with funding from the Low Carbon Communities program.

“Communities across Nova Scotia have shown that they want to be a part of our clean energy future. Nova Scotia has set ambitious climate change goals, and these investments support innovative local ideas that will help us achieve them,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables.

The Province is investing over $971,000 for 16 projects across Nova Scotia under the Low Carbon Communities program for 2021-22. 

One of the grant recipients is the Municipality of the County of Colchester, which is receiving $50,000 for a design study to convert municipal facilities in Colchester and New Glasgow to net-zero, high-performance buildings. 

Potlotek First Nation in Cape Breton is receiving $37,500 for its solar maintenance training project. Working with the Nova Scotia Community College, they will develop a customized solar panel maintenance and repair training course for Potlotek and We’koqma’q First Nation communities. This training can be made available across the province. 

CAA Atlantic is receiving over $29,000 for its roadside electric vehicle (EV) battery charging pilot project to test the performance of portable electric vehicle chargers as part of its roadside assistance service in Nova Scotia. 

Low Carbon Communities funding can be used for community planning and designs, feasibility studies, education, public engagement and initiatives that demonstrate positive and innovative low carbon solutions.

Quotes:
“Our municipality, like many others in Nova Scotia, has aging and inefficient buildings which are a big barrier to achieving net-zero emissions and a climate-stable future. This funding from Low Carbon Communities will allow Colchester and its partners – ReCover, QUEST, and the Town of New Glasgow – to advance a deep energy retrofit innovation that will help to accelerate the transition to net-zero buildings that are easier to heat and more comfortable places.”
      - Christine Blair, Mayor, Municipality of the County of Colchester

“We are exceptionally pleased to work with the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables to build capacity in photovoltaic maintenance training in both Potlotek First Nation and We’koqma’q First Nation. This will allow both indigenous communities to maintain existing and future solar farms. We are working collaboratively to ensure forward movement to reduce emissions by 2030.”
      - Tahirih Paul, Economic Development Officer, Potlotek First Nation

Quick Facts:
-- since 2018, the Low Carbon Communities program has invested over $3.1 million to support 55 community-led projects across the province
-- the program supports community-driven projects that help create long-lasting greenhouse gas reductions through low carbon, clean energy projects 
-- the program is open to community groups, municipalities, First Nations, post-secondary institutions, businesses and non-profit organizations with projects that benefit Nova Scotia communities

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness / Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment","Premier Calls Doctors Home","PREMIER’S OFFICE/HEALTH/WELLNESS/OFFICE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS RECRUITMENT--Premier Calls Doctors Home
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Premier Tim Houston launched a recruitment campaign today, March 7, to bring more doctors home to Nova Scotia.

Doctors who go to the Come Home to Nova Scotia website and say they want to work in the province will be contacted by a recruitment specialist within 24 hours. Those who qualify could receive a conditional offer of employment within 10 business days.

“Having more doctors in more communities across this province is a priority for Nova Scotians – and for the government,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I’ve heard from doctors who moved away to train and many really want to come home. I want them to know that we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to make healthcare better for patients, doctors and all healthcare professionals. I am happy to speak personally to doctors if that will help convince them to come home.”

Friends and family members who know doctors who want to come home are also encouraged to help spread the word.

As well, the government is increasing the budget for physician incentives by nearly $10 million and has created two new programs to recruit new doctors and retain graduates.

The new Primary Care Physician Incentive Program encourages doctors to establish a family practice outside the central health zone. Doctors who qualify can earn up to $125,000 in incentives – $25,000 when they sign the agreement and $20,000 per year for the next five years. These payments will be made at the end of each year after key targets are met.

The new Specialist Physician Incentive Program offers the same incentives to specialists who establish a practice outside Central Zone.

These two incentive programs replace existing programs. Nova Scotia also has educational incentives for physicians who stay in the province after graduation.
 
A team of navigators has been established and is now in place to connect doctors and other healthcare professionals with the information they need to support their move to Nova Scotia. In addition, a broader recruitment campaign aimed at attracting healthcare professionals was launched in December.
 
The Come Home to Nova Scotia website highlights the government’s commitment to the healthcare sector – a commitment that includes respect for all healthcare workers, competitive compensation and establishing pensionable benefits for physicians. 
 
Quotes:
“Nova Scotia is a great opportunity for doctors: we have the highest compensation in the region for family doctors, exciting research is happening here, there are strong financial incentives and we are renovating and building new facilities so they have modern, cutting-edge places to work. This is also a beautiful province that is a great place to live and raise a family.” 
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness and Minister responsible for the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

“I spent 30 years practising medicine in Nova Scotia and know firsthand how great a place it is to live and work. My team and I share that message every day with doctors who are from Nova Scotia and want to come back home and those who are looking for the kind of lifestyle this province offers.”
     - Dr. Kevin Orrell, Deputy Minister and CEO, Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

“Physician recruitment is extremely competitive, so I’m pleased to see that Nova Scotia’s recruiters now have more tools in their toolbox. We hope to work with government to ensure these new incentives are administered in a way that fully supports the needs of physician recruits.”
     - Dr. Heather Johnson, President, Doctors Nova Scotia

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le dernier communiqué de presse quotidien sur la COVID-19 et la dernière mise à jour du tableau de bord sur les données de la pandémie sont publiés aujourd’hui 4 mars, puisque la Nouvelle-Écosse passera maintenant à une mise à jour par semaine sur la COVID-19. Le prochain communiqué sur la COVID-19 et la prochaine mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la pandémie seront publiés le jeudi 10 mars.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 4 mars, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que sept autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et que trois personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également quatre décès liés à la COVID-19 :
-- un homme dans la cinquantaine dans le secteur du nord,
-- un septuagénaire dans le secteur de l'est,
-- un octogénaire dans le secteur du nord,
-- un octogénaire dans le secteur de l'ouest.

« C’est encore une autre journée difficile pour notre province, car nous devons adresser des condoléances à quatre autres familles qui ont perdu un être cher à cause de la COVID-19, a annoncé le premier ministre Tim Houston. La meilleure chose à faire est toujours de suivre les conseils de la Santé publique, de se faire vacciner, de se faire tester et de rester à la maison si on ne se sent pas bien. C’est comme ça que nous pourrons nous protéger et protéger les autres. »

À l’heure actuelle, 45 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 13 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 5 à 91 ans. L'âge médian est de 61 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,5 jours.

« Il n'est jamais facile d’annoncer un décès causé par la COVID-19. Il s'agit d'un triste rappel de la nature grave de ce virus et de son effet sur les gens et leur famille, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. À mesure que les restrictions s’assouplissent davantage et que nous passons au stade de la vie avec le virus, il est important de ne pas oublier que la pandémie n’est pas terminée. La COVID-19 est toujours présente chez nous, alors faites-vous vacciner, passez régulièrement un test de dépistage et continuez de suivre les conseils de la Santé publique pour aider à protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables de la Nouvelle-Écosse. »

Parmi les 45 personnes hospitalisées, 43 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

Voici le profil vaccinal des personnes hospitalisées :
-- 12 (26,7 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 23 (51,1 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 1 (2,2 %) n'a reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 9 (20 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que moins de 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Il y a également deux autres groupes de personnes à l’hôpital à cause de la COVID-19 :
-- 117 personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à leur arrivée à l'hôpital, mais ont été admises pour un autre problème de santé, ou elles ont été admises à cause de la COVID-19 mais n'ont plus besoin de soins spécialisés;
-- 158 personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 après avoir été admises à l’hôpital.

Vaccination

Au 3 mars, 2 217 196 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 92,2 % sont une première dose et 86,8 % sont une deuxième dose.

En outre, 62,7 % des gens de 18 ans et plus ont reçu une dose de rappel et 0,3 % ont pris rendez-vous pour la recevoir.

Le 3 mars, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 1 632 tests. On signale 294 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire.

Il y a 117 cas dans le secteur du centre, 64 dans le secteur de l'est, 43 dans le secteur du nord et 70 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

On prévoit une augmentation du nombre de nouveaux cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire en raison d'un changement au protocole de dépistage annoncé la semaine dernière. Les gens qui obtiennent un résultat positif à un test rapide peuvent maintenant obtenir un test PCR analysé en laboratoire pour confirmer le résultat.

Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'il y a 2 650 cas actifs de COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Le gouvernement provincial reconduit l'état d'urgence afin de protéger la santé et la sécurité des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et d'assurer la continuité des mesures de sécurité et d'autres mesures importantes. L’ordonnance prend effet à midi le dimanche 6 mars 2022 et l’état d’urgence prendra fin à 23 h 59 le dimanche 20 mars 2022.

Nova Scotia is also reporting four deaths related to COVID-19:
-- a man in his 50s in Northern Zone
-- a man in his 70s in Eastern Zone
-- a man in his 80s in Northern Zone
-- a man in his 80s in Western Zone.

“This is another difficult day for our province as we send condolences to four more families who have lost loved ones to COVID-19,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Our way forward continues to be following public health advice, getting vaccinated, getting tested and staying home if you feel unwell. Doing this will help protect ourselves and others.”

There are 45 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 13 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is five to 91 years old. The median age is 61, and the median length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.5 days.

“It is never easy reporting COVID-19 deaths, as it is a sad reminder of the serious nature of this virus and the impact it has on people and their families,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “As restrictions start to lift even more and we shift to living with COVID, it’s important to remember the pandemic is not over. COVID-19 is still circulating in communities across the province – so get vaccinated, test regularly and continue to follow public health advice to help protect our most vulnerable Nova Scotians.”

Of the 45 people in hospital, 43 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 12 (26.7 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 23 (51.1 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 1 (2.2 per cent) is partially vaccinated
-- 9 (20 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

-- 158 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of March 3, 2,217,196 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 92.2 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 86.8 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 62.7 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 0.3 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

On March 3, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 1,632 tests. An additional 294 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 117 cases in Central Zone, 64 cases in Eastern Zone, 43 cases in Northern Zone and 70 cases in Western Zone.

There will be an increase in new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported because of a change in testing protocol announced last week. People with positive rapid test results are now able to get a confirmatory PCR lab test.

As of today, there are an estimated 2,650 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

The Province is renewing the state of emergency to protect the health and safety of Nova Scotians and ensure safety measures and other important actions can continue. The order will take effect at noon, Sunday, March 6, and the state of emergency will end at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, March 20, 2022.

--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians will see COVID-19 restrictions ease further and an evolving approach to testing and case and contact management starting next week.

At 12:01 a.m. on Monday, March 7, Phase 2 of the Province’s reopening plan begins. The main changes are increases in gathering and capacity limits. Details on Phase 2 can be found here: https://novascotia.ca/reopening-plan/phase-two/

Nova Scotia is also recommending the use of rapid tests to help protect people at increased risk of severe disease. People who are older or immunocompromised and those who live with them or are around them are encouraged to do occasional or regular rapid testing, even if they don’t have symptoms.

“Epidemiology is improving and restrictions are gradually lifting, but the pandemic is not over and we need to continue to evolve our testing strategy,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “Through the Omicron wave, rapid tests were used mainly to diagnose COVID-19 among close contacts and people with symptoms. We are now encouraging Nova Scotians to also use rapid tests as a way to help protect vulnerable people in our communities as we move toward a state of living with COVID-19.”

Nova Scotians can also protect themselves and the vulnerable people in their circles by continuing to follow other precautions like staying home when sick, wearing masks, practising good hand hygiene and physical distance, and carefully choosing activities and social groups.

Rapid tests continue to be available in communities at pop-up sites, family resource centres and some libraries. More information is available at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing. Community distribution will be further expanded in the coming weeks.

People who have symptoms or wish to get tested as household contacts should continue to complete the online self-assessment and book appointments for either PCR tests or to pick up rapid tests as directed at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en

Changes to the isolation requirements for people with COVID-19 and their contacts will also take effect on Monday:

Regardless of age or vaccination status, people who test positive will need to isolate for seven days from when their symptoms began (or from the date of their positive test if they did not have symptoms). They can stop isolating on the eighth day as long as they don’t have symptoms or symptoms are improving and they’ve had no fever for 24 hours. They will no longer be asked to notify any contacts outside their homes.

Contacts with no symptoms

There will no longer be isolation or testing requirements for contacts who do not have symptoms. Contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 are not required to isolate or get tested but should monitor for symptoms. If the contact lives with the person who tests positive, the contact is not required to isolate or get tested but should monitor for symptoms and testing is recommended.

People with symptoms

People who live with someone who tests positive for COVID-19 and develops symptoms will need to isolate and test immediately, and then do a second test 72 hours later. If using rapid tests, a third test is required 48 hours after the second. People can leave isolation if all tests are negative, symptoms are improving and they’ve had no fever for 24 hours.

There is no change for people who do not live with a person who tested positive for COVID-19 and develop symptoms – they still need to isolate and test immediately. If using rapid tests, a second test 48 hours after the first is required.

Anyone who tests positive with a rapid test can get that result confirmed with a PCR test if they wish.

People can leave isolation if all tests are negative, symptoms are improving and they’ve had no fever for 24 hours. The Nova Scotia Health Authority website will be updated with more details at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus

Anyone who is still within 90 days of recovering from a confirmed case of COVID-19 does not have to isolate or test. If they develop symptoms during that period, they should still stay home because they are sick with something (such as a cold or flu) and should avoid spreading it to others.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Phase 2 de la reprise des activités, changements aux tests et à la gestion des contacts et des cas","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Phase 2 de la reprise des activités, changements aux tests et à la gestion des contacts et des cas 
-------------------------------------------------------
La semaine prochaine, les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse verront un allègement accru des restrictions liées à la COVID-19 et une approche mieux adaptée concernant les tests et la gestion des cas et des contacts étroits.

La 2e phase du plan provincial de reprise des activités commence à minuit une minute le lundi 7 mars. Les principaux changements portent sur les limites imposées aux rassemblements et sur la capacité d’accueil des lieux publics. On trouvera ici les détails de la 2e phase du plan (en anglais seulement) : https://novascotia.ca/reopening-plan/phase-two/.

La Nouvelle-Écosse recommande également l’utilisation des tests de dépistage rapide pour aider à protéger les gens qui présentent un risque accru de maladie grave. Les personnes âgées ou immunodéficientes et les personnes qui vivent avec elles ou qui les fréquentent sont encouragées à passer un test de dépistage rapide de manière occasionnelle ou régulière, même si elles ne présentent pas de symptômes.

« Les données liées à la maladie s’améliorent et les restrictions sont levées graduellement, mais la pandémie n’est pas terminée et nous devons continuer d’adapter notre stratégie entourant les tests, de dire le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Durant la vague Omicron, nous avons utilisé les tests de dépistage rapide principalement pour diagnostiquer la COVID-19 chez les contacts étroits et les personnes ayant des symptômes. Nous encourageons maintenant les gens à utiliser aussi les tests de dépistage rapide pour aider à protéger les personnes vulnérables à mesure que nous passons au stade de la vie avec la COVID-19. »

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse peuvent aussi se protéger et protéger les personnes vulnérables dans leur entourage en continuant de prendre d’autres précautions comme rester à la maison si on est malade, porter le masque, bien se laver les mains et garder une distance physique entre nous et les autres, et en choisissant avec soins ses activités et ses groupes sociaux.

Les tests de dépistage rapide continuent d’être distribués dans les cliniques temporaires, les centres de ressources familiales et dans certaines bibliothèques. Pour en savoir plus (site en anglais) : https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing. La distribution dans les localités s’élargira davantage au cours des prochaines semaines.

Les personnes qui présentent des symptômes ou qui souhaitent se faire tester parce qu’elles sont un contact étroit au sein du ménage devraient continuer de remplir l’auto-évaluation en ligne et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test PCR ou pour se procurer des tests de dépistage rapide comme on l’explique ici : https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. 

Des changements aux exigences d’isolement pour les personnes atteintes de la COVID-19 et leurs contacts étroits entreront également en vigueur lundi.

Personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage

Peu importe l’âge ou le profil vaccinal, les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage devront s’isoler pendant sept jours à partir du moment où leurs symptômes sont apparus (ou à partir de la date d’obtention du résultat positif si elles n’avaient pas de symptômes). Elles peuvent mettre fin à l’isolement le huitième jour tant qu’elles n’ont pas de symptômes ou que les symptômes s’amenuisent, et qu’elles n’ont pas de fièvre depuis 24 heures. Elles n’auront plus à aviser les personnes avec lesquelles elles ont eu des contacts à l’extérieur du foyer.

Personnes ayant eu un contact étroit avec une personne infectée, mais qui n’ont pas de symptômes

Les personnes ayant eu un contact étroit avec une personne infectée et qui ne présentent pas de symptômes n’auront plus à s’isoler ni à se faire tester. Les personnes ayant eu des contacts étroits avec des gens qui ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19 n’ont pas besoin de s’isoler ni de se faire tester, mais elles doivent surveiller l’apparition de symptômes. Si la personne ayant eu un contact étroit vit avec la personne qui a contracté la maladie, la personne ayant eu le contact étroit n’a pas à s’isoler ni à se faire tester, mais elle devrait surveiller l’apparition de symptômes; il est recommandé qu’elle se fasse tester.

Personnes qui présentent des symptômes

Les personnes qui vivent avec une personne qui a contracté la COVID-19 et qui développent des symptômes devront s’isoler et se faire tester immédiatement, et se faire tester 72 heures plus tard. Si on utilise des tests de dépistage rapide, il faut faire un troisième test 48 heures après le deuxième test. Les gens peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement si tous les tests sont négatifs, si les symptômes s’amenuisent et s’ils n’ont pas de fièvre pendant 24 heures.

Il n’y a aucun changement pour les personnes qui ne vivent pas avec une personne qui a contracté la COVID-19 et qui développent des symptômes : elles doivent s’isoler et passer un test de dépistage immédiatement. Si on utilise des tests de dépistage rapide, il faut faire un troisième test 48 heures après le deuxième test. 

Toute personne qui obtient un résultat positif au test de dépistage rapide peut faire confirmer ce résultat au moyen d’un test PCR si elle le souhaite.

Les gens peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement si tous les tests sont négatifs, si les symptômes s’amenuisent et s’ils n’ont pas de fièvre pendant 24 heures. Le site Web de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse sera mis à jour et contiendra plus d’information (en anglais seulement) : https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus. 

Toute personne qui n’a pas dépassé le cap des 90 jours de récupération après avoir contracté la COVID-19 n’a pas à s’isoler ni à passer de test. Si elle développe des symptômes durant cette période, elle devrait quand même rester à la maison parce qu’elle est malade (p. ex. elle a un rhume ou la grippe) et éviter de contaminer d’autres personnes.

REMARQUE : Le dernier communiqué de presse quotidien sur la COVID-19 et la dernière mise à jour du tableau de bord sur les données de la pandémie seront publiés le vendredi 4 mars, puisque la Nouvelle-Écosse passera maintenant à la publication d’un communiqué par semaine. Le prochain communiqué sur la COVID-19 et la prochaine mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la pandémie seront publiés le jeudi 10 mars.
----------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 3 mars, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que six autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et qu’une personne a reçu son congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également trois décès liés à la COVID-19 :
-- deux hommes septuagénaires dans le secteur de l’est et
-- un octogénaire dans le secteur du centre.

« J’offre mes sincères condoléances aux proches des trois personnes qui sont décédées des suites de la maladie causée par ce virus, a indiqué le premier ministre Time Houston. À mesure que nous levons les restrictions et que nous poursuivons la reprise des activités, nous ne devons pas oublier que le virus circule toujours au sein de la population. C’est pourquoi il est si important que les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse respectent l’esprit et la lettre des mesures de santé publique pour nous protéger nous-mêmes et pour protéger les autres du coronavirus. »

À l’heure actuelle, 46 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 12 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 5 à 92 ans. L'âge médian est de 62 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,5 jours.

« Mes pensées et mes prières accompagnent les familles et les amis des trois hommes qui sont décédés, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La COVID-19 est toujours présente dans notre province et il est toujours important que tous les gens continuent de suivre les mesures et les conseils de santé publique au moment où nous commençons lentement à vivre avec le virus. » 

Parmi les 46 personnes hospitalisées, 44 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

Voici le profil vaccinal des personnes hospitalisées :
-- 14 (30,4 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 21 (45,7 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 1 (2,2 %) n'a reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 10 (21,7 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que moins de 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Il y a également deux autres groupes de personnes à l’hôpital à cause de la COVID-19 :
-- 122 personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à leur arrivée à l'hôpital, mais ont été admises pour un autre problème de santé, ou elles ont été admises à cause de la COVID-19 mais n'ont plus besoin de soins spécialisés;
-- 161 personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 après avoir été admises à l’hôpital.

Vaccination

Au 2 mars, 2 216 365 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 92,1 % sont une première dose et 86,8 % sont une deuxième dose.

En outre, 62,6 % des gens de 18 ans et plus ont reçu une dose de rappel et 0,3 % ont pris rendez-vous pour la recevoir.

Cas et dépistage

Le 2 mars, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 007 tests. On signale 421 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire.

Il y a 143 cas dans le secteur du centre, 88 dans le secteur de l'est, 105 dans le secteur du nord et 85 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

On prévoit une augmentation du nombre de nouveaux cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire en raison d'un changement au protocole de dépistage annoncé la semaine dernière. Les gens qui obtiennent un résultat positif à un test rapide peuvent maintenant obtenir un test PCR analysé en laboratoire pour confirmer le résultat.

Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'il y a 2 514 cas actifs de COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Éclosions dans les hôpitaux 

La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse signale une nouvelle éclosion dans une unité à l’hôpital de Glace Bay. Moins de cinq patients y ont contracté la COVID-19.

La Régie signale également deux nouveaux cas liés à une éclosion à l’hôpital Harbour View de Sydney Mines. Moins de cinq patients y ont contracté la COVID-19.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 6 mars 2022.

-------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The last daily COVID-19 news release and data dashboard update will be on Friday, March 4, as Nova Scotia moves to weekly reporting. The next COVID-19 release and dashboard update will be on Thursday, March 10.
--------------------------------------------------------
Today, March 3, Nova Scotia is reporting six new hospital admissions and one discharge.

Nova Scotia is also reporting three deaths related to COVID-19:
-- two men in their 70s in Eastern Zone
-- a man in his 80s in Central Zone.

“I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of the three Nova Scotians who died from this virus,” said Premier Tim Houston. “As we lift restrictions and continue to reopen, we must not forget that this virus is still circulating in our communities. That is why it is so important Nova Scotians follow both the letter and the spirit of the public health measures to protect ourselves and others from this virus.”

There are 46 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 12 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is five to 92 years old. The median age is 62, and the median length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.5 days.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the three men who have passed away,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “COVID-19 is still in our province, and it continues to be very important for all Nova Scotians to follow the public health measures and advice as we start to move toward living with COVID.”

Of the 46 people in hospital, 44 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 14 (30.4 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 21 (45.7 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 1 (2.2 per cent) is partially vaccinated
-- 10 (21.7 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 122 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 161 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of March 2, 2,216,365 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 92.1 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 86.8 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 62.6 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 0.3 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

On March 2, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 2,007 tests. An additional 421 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 143 cases in Central Zone, 88 cases in Eastern Zone, 105 cases in Northern Zone and 85 cases in Western Zone.

There will be an increase in new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported because of a change in testing protocol announced last week. People with positive rapid test results are now able to get a confirmatory PCR lab test.

As of today, there are an estimated 2,514 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Hospital Outbreaks: 

NSHA is reporting a new outbreak in a ward at Glace Bay Hospital. Fewer than five patients have tested positive.

NSHA is also reporting two additional cases related to the outbreak at Harbour View Hospital in Sydney Mines. Fewer than five patients have tested positive.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to March 6, 2022

The government is making the Innovation Rebate Program a permanent program and investing $12 million each year to help Nova Scotia businesses thrive.

Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development, made the announcement to a business audience today, March 3. Two other pilot rebate programs – the Forestry Innovation Rebate Program and the Small and Medium Enterprise Innovation Rebate Program – will be combined with the Innovation Rebate Program to form a single program, effective April 1. The three programs had been set to end March 31.

Since their inception, rebates through these programs have led to companies of all sizes committing to 38 projects in 14 counties across the province. 

“We are focused on investing in solutions that work and these innovation rebates have a proven track record of success,” said Minister Corkum-Greek. “This program will help more Nova Scotia businesses adopt new technologies and innovative solutions and advance our government’s priority of helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint and become more sustainable and competitive.”

The Innovation Rebate Program encourages investments in innovative processes and green technologies. Participating companies can increase their competitiveness through product development, improvements in production and greening waste streams. 

Crown corporation Nova Scotia Business Inc. (NSBI) will continue administering the program. Companies receive a 25 per cent rebate of eligible project costs for approved projects. The project costs must be between $350,000 and $15 million.

The program will play an important role in helping the Minister of Economic Development fulfill her mandate of attracting and growing innovative, sustainable and green businesses across the province and supporting small businesses in reducing emissions.

“With tools such as the Innovation Rebate Program, NSBI is continuing to help make it possible for businesses to invest in themselves, adapt to climate change and mitigate some shocks caused by COVID-19. In particular, rural businesses need solutions as they attract and retain workers and increase investments in technology, so their businesses not only survive, but thrive.”

Aujourd'hui 2 mars, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que quatre autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et que deux personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également quatre décès liés à la COVID-19 :
-- une femme dans la cinquantaine dans le secteur du centre
-- un octogénaire dans le secteur de l'ouest
-- un nonagénaire dans le secteur du centre
-- un nonagénaire dans le secteur de l'est

« Toutes mes condoléances aux familles et aux proches des quatre personnes qui sont décédées, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Il est triste de voir que nous avons encore des décès en raison de ce virus en ce début du mois et du printemps. Faites-vous vacciner et obtenez votre dose de rappel. Si vous ne voulez pas le faire pour vous-même, faites-le pour vos proches afin de prévenir tout autre décès dans notre province. » 

À l'heure actuelle, 45 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 12 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 5 à 92 ans. L'âge médian est de 61 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,6 jours.

« J'offre mes sincères condoléances aux quatre familles qui viennent de perdre un être cher en raison de la COVID-19, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. N'oubliez surtout pas que ce virus peut être mortel. Protégez-vous et protégez vos proches en vous faisant vacciner, en continuant de porter le masque et en suivant les conseils de la Santé publique pour prévenir la propagation. »

Parmi les 45 personnes hospitalisées, 43 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

Today, March 2, Nova Scotia is reporting four new hospital admissions and two discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting four deaths related to COVID-19:
-- a woman in her 50s in Central Zone
-- a man in his 80s in Western Zone
-- a man in his 90s in Central Zone
-- a man in his 90s in Eastern Zone.

“I’m sending condolences to the families and loved ones of the four people who passed away,” said Premier Tim Houston. “It is sad to be entering a new month, the beginning of spring, and we’re still seeing deaths from this virus. Please get vaccinated and get boosted, if not for yourself, then for your loved ones so we don’t see any more deaths in our province.” 

There are 45 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 12 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is five to 92 years old. The median age is 61, and the median length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.6 days.

“My deepest sympathies go out to the four families who have just experienced the loss of a loved one to COVID-19,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Please remember that this virus can be deadly and protect yourselves and your loved ones by getting all your vaccines, continuing to wear your face masks and following public health advice to prevent the spread.”

Of the 45 people in hospital, 43 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:

-- 20 (44.4 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 2 (4.4 per cent) are partially vaccinated
-- 11 (24.4 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
Tourism Nova Scotia is launching new marketing campaigns to encourage people to explore the province this summer.

“People are excited to travel again, and our marketing campaigns showcase all the reasons why Nova Scotia should be the top pick for a summer vacation,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “We are optimistic that this will be a year of strong recovery for the industry, and we will continue to support tourism recovery and growth moving forward.”

The Calling All Doers campaign launched in Ontario, Quebec, the northeastern United States, United Kingdom and Germany in mid-February, two weeks earlier than in previous years. The goal is to catch people in those farther away markets when they are in the early stages of planning their summer travel. The campaign will launch in Atlantic Canada in early April. Tourism Nova Scotia will also be launching a summer campaign in Nova Scotia at the end of April.

Calling All Doers uses a fresh and fun creative approach to highlight the breadth of things to see and do in Nova Scotia that people can’t experience anywhere else. In North America, ads will run on TV, billboards, digital video, digital display, digital audio, social media, and paid search, while the campaigns in Germany and the United Kingdom will focus on digital advertising.

Quotes: 
“Tourism is a vital part of Nova Scotia’s economy, creating jobs and business opportunities in every region of the province. Provincial tourism marketing campaigns help encourage tourism spending by showcasing the spectacular food, culture, entertainment, and travel experiences available in Nova Scotia, including in our region of Yarmouth and Acadian Shores.” 
     - Neil MacKenzie, Executive Director, Yarmouth & Acadian Shores Tourism Association

Quick Facts: 
-- the province will invest about $8 million in tourism marketing campaigns in 2022 
-- Tourism Nova Scotia will run campaigns for the summer, fall and winter seasons to encourage year-round tourism spending
--Tourism Nova Scotia conducted a return-on-investment study of its 2021 marketing campaigns and found that every dollar spent on advertising generated $45 in tourism spending in the province

“These investments deliver on our government’s commitment to support regional, homegrown tourism,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “The three streams of programming will draw more people to our communities and encourage spending across the hospitality, arts, culture, museums, events and retail sectors.”

Program guidelines will be finalized and launched to the tourism industry the week of March 7.  

Quotes:
“As we begin the rebuild of Nova Scotia’s tourism industry, TIANS is extremely pleased to see additional funding being made available to promote regional tourism and businesses. This program will enable Nova Scotia accommodation operators to work with local suppliers to put compelling packages together and extend the operating season.  COVID-19 decimated the Nova Scotia tourism economy with a loss of $1.6 billion in revenue in both 2020 and 2021, and as of today we are still down 20,000 jobs.   Over the coming months TIANS looks forward to working with government on a strategic rebuilding plan that will support the sector reclaiming its position as Nova Scotia’s No. 1 service export.”
     - Darlene Grant Fiander, President, Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia

“The pandemic has accelerated digital adoption and Nova Scotia tourism businesses need to be online with good websites and online booking options. We’re pleased to be able to offer programming in partnership with Digital Nova Scotia to help operators enhance their online presence and digital marketing skills.”

The government is investing more than $3.8 million for renovations to the Halifax Infirmary as part of the ongoing redevelopment and expansion of the QEII Health Sciences Centre.

To allow for the construction of a new inpatient building at the Halifax Infirmary, the mechanical and electrical services at the Robie Street entrance will be relocated and the parkade on Robie Street will also be demolished. The new Summer Street parkade will be completed this spring.

Renovations to the Summer Street entrance, interior and exterior, are needed as it will become the main entrance of the Halifax Infirmary during the expansion project.

The two entrances will be open during their renovations. The Robie Street entrance will be closed when the Summer Street entrance is complete. The Summer Street entrance will be the main entrance.

“The QEII New Generation project will ensure modern, high-quality facilities so Nova Scotians get the care they deserve, and healthcare professionals will have state-of-the-art places to provide that care,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson.

Quick Facts:
-- the expanded Halifax Infirmary site, the heart of the redevelopment of the QEII Health Sciences Centre, will have modern facilities and advanced technologies to handle the most complex care in Atlantic Canada
-- expansion benefits include reduced wait times, improved access to care and additional research and teaching opportunities to help recruit and retain healthcare professionals
-- the government is making the most significant infrastructure investment in Nova Scotia history to modernize healthcare facilities in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Halifax Regional Municipality, Bridgewater, Pugwash and other communities across the province

----------------------------------------------------------------
Les étudiants au baccalauréat en éducation (B.Ed.) qui sont admissibles et qui terminent leur dernière année d'études seront maintenant en mesure de faire de la suppléance dans la province, avec rémunération. 

Pour appuyer la demande accrue d'enseignants suppléants à l'échelle de la province, les étudiants au B.Ed. admissibles recevront un certificat d'aptitude à l'enseignement temporaire leur permettant de faire de la suppléance rémunérée en classe. Les étudiants qui choisissent de faire de la suppléance seront seulement rémunérés pour les jours où ils sont embauchés à titre de suppléants.

« Nous voulons que nos futurs enseignants soient excités à l'idée d'entamer leur carrière et de rester ici en Nouvelle-Écosse, affirme Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducaiton et du Développement de la petite enfance. Permettre aux étudiants-maîtres d'avoir l'occasion de faire de la suppléance rémunérée pendant leur stage leur offre une expérience dans leur futur domaine tout en répondant aux besoins actuels en matière d'enseignants suppléants. » 

Les étudiants-maîtres continueront d'être supervisés par leur conseiller universitaire les jours où ils sont embauchés à titre de suppléants, et ils seront appuyés par l'administration scolaire et les autres enseignants. La suppléance est un choix volontaire qui n'entraînera aucun retard dans le programme de baccalauréat en éducation.

La Province a collaboré étroitement avec le Syndicat des enseignants de la Nouvelle-Écosse et les cinq universités qui offrent des programmes de B.Ed. pour offrir un certificat d'aptitude à l'enseignement temporaire aux étudiants qui obtiendront leur diplôme en mai.

Même si nous apprenons à vivre avec la COVID-19, il est important que tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse continuent de suivre les mesures qui sont en place depuis les deux dernières années pour limiter la propagation du virus et protéger les gens qui nous entourent qui sont plus vulnérables à une maladie grave. Ces mesures incluent porter un masque dans les lieux publics intérieurs, rester à la maison et se faire tester lorsqu'on ne se sent pas bien et respecter les conseils en matière de santé publique. »

À l'heure actuelle, 48 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 11 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 2 à 92 ans. L'âge médian est de 62 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,5 jours.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Eligible bachelor of education (B.Ed.) students in their final year of study will now be able to work and be paid as substitute teachers in the province. 

To support the increased demand for substitute teachers across the province, eligible B.Ed. students will receive a temporary teacher’s licence and can teach and be paid as substitutes in the classroom if they choose. Student teachers will only get paid for the days they are hired to substitute.

“We want our soon-to-be teachers to feel excited about starting their careers and staying here in Nova Scotia,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Allowing student teachers the opportunity to get paid to substitute on an as-need basis during their practicum not only provides experience in a field they will soon be entering, but also addresses the current need for more substitutes.” 

Student teachers will continue to be supervised by their university advisor the days they are hired to substitute and will be supported by school administration and other teachers. Choosing to substitute is voluntary and will not impact or delay completion of the bachelor of education program.

The Province worked closely with the Nova Scotia Teachers Union and the five universities that offer B.Ed. programs to provide students who are set to graduate in May a conditional teacher’s certificate. 

Quotes:
“We are pleased that our soon-to-be graduates have this opportunity to support Nova Scotia public schools during this exceptional time. Faculties across the province worked with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and the Office of Teacher Certification to ensure our students could contribute to this initiative, while maintaining our focus on quality teacher education. Our teacher education candidates continue to adapt to the pandemic; they are ready to meet this most recent challenge and are eager to accept this professional responsibility.”

About 75 volunteers from the agriculture and aquaculture industries will visit 186 grades 3 and 4 classrooms this month – a total of about 4,000 students. Visits will be virtual or in-person, based on public health restrictions at the time.

Grade 3 students will take part in an interactive project in which they learn about growing produce from seeds. Students in Grade 4 will learn about the aquaculture industry through a partnership with the Centre for Oceans Ventures and Entrepreneurship (COVE) in Dartmouth.

A Nova Scotia farm will also participate in The Great Canadian Farm Tour, in which each province will host a live, virtual farm tour. Taproot Farms in Kings County will be one of many different types of farms across the country taking part. Teachers and students in Nova Scotia and across Canada will be able to watch and ask questions.

Quotes:
“Now more than ever, young Canadians are curious about where their food comes from. It’s important that they connect with farmers and feel a pride and appreciation for the care that farmers have for their land and crops. I join you in celebrating Canadian Agriculture Literacy Month and congratulate the dedicated team at Agriculture in the Classroom Canada for another successful year.”
     - Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food

“It is exciting to be included in this national farm tour. Having the opportunity to share with youth across the country what we do on our farm here in Nova Scotia is an honour. I am thrilled that so many teachers have signed up to bring agriculture to the classroom.”
     - Patricia Bishop, Taproot Farms, Port Williams

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Six nouvelles hospitalisations, quatre congés, sept décès","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE-- Six nouvelles hospitalisations, quatre congés, sept décès 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 28 février, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que six autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et que quatre personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également sept décès liés à la COVID-19 : 
-- un homme dans la trentaine dans le secteur du centre
-- un homme dans la soixantaine dans le secteur du centre
-- une femme dans la soixantaine dans le secteur du nord,
-- un septuagénaire dans le secteur du nord
-- un octogénaire dans le secteur du nord
-- deux femmes octogénaires dans le secteur du centre

Les données sur les décès proviennent de Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique. Ces données sont entrées dans le système seulement lorsqu'il est déterminé que le décès est lié à la COVID-19. Cette enquête peut prendre quelques jours ou quelques semaines.  La majorité des données sur les décès reflètent l'activité virale dans le passé, soit au moment de l'infection, et non la situation actuelle, soit au moment du signalement.

« Trop de personnes ont perdu la vie en raison de ce virus, et je suis de tout coeur avec les familles et les proches qui pleurent la perte d'un être cher, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous savons que le virus peut être dévastateur. Alors que nous assouplissons les restrictions, je demande à tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de faire attention à leur santé et de prendre les mesures nécessaires pour se protéger et pour protéger les gens qui les entourent. La précaution la plus importante est de rester à la maison si vous êtes malade et de respecter les conseils de la Santé publique pour le dépistage et l'isolement. »

À l'heure actuelle, 45 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 10 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 5 à 92 ans. L'âge médian est de 59 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,6 jours.

« J'offre toutes mes condoléances aux familles des personnes décédées, déclare le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Même si nous apprenons à vivre avec la COVID-19, il est important que tout le monde comprenne que la Nouvelle-Écosse continuera de recenser de nouveaux cas. Faites-vous vacciner si ce n'est pas déjà fait, restez à la maison si vous vous sentez mal et respectez les protocoles de la Santé publique qui sont en place pour vous protéger et pour protéger vos communautés. » 

Parmi les 45 personnes hospitalisées, 43 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

Voici le profil vaccinal des personnes hospitalisées :
-- 11 (24,4 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 20 (44,4 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 1 (2,2 %) n'a reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 13 (28,9 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que moins de 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Il y a également deux autres groupes de personnes à l'hôpital à cause de la COVID-19 :
-- 122 personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à leur arrivée à l'hôpital mais ont été admises pour une autre raison de santé, ou elles ont été admises à cause de la COVID-19 mais n'ont plus besoin de soins spécialisés;
-- 166 personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 après avoir été admises à l'hôpital.

Vaccination

Au 27 février, 2 212 224 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. En Nouvelle-Écosse, 92,1 % des gens ont reçu leur première dose et 86,7 % ont reçu leur deuxième dose.

En outre, 62,3 % des gens de 18 ans et plus ont reçu une dose de rappel et 0,6 % ont pris rendez-vous pour recevoir leur dose de rappel.

Cas et dépistage

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 1 941 tests le 25 février, 1 512 tests le 26 février et 1 449 tests le 27 février. 

Le 26 février, on a signalé 322 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire, soit 168 cas dans le secteur du centre, 45 dans le secteur de l'est, 53 dans le secteur du nord et 56 dans le secteur de l'ouest. 

Le 27 février, on a signalé 322 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire, soit 128 cas dans le secteur du centre, 64 dans le secteur de l'est, 64 dans le secteur du nord et 66 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Aujourd'hui 28 février, on signale 243 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire, soit 133 cas dans le secteur du centre, 24 dans le secteur de l'est, 57 dans le secteur du nord et 29 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

On prévoit une augmentation du nombre de cas de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire en raison des gens qui sont maintenant en mesure de confirmer un résultat positif sur un test rapide par un test PCR. Les nouveaux cas signalés formeront donc une plus grande proportion du nombre de cas total dans la province.

Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'il y a 1 967 cas actifs de COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Éclosions dans les hôpitaux

La Régie signale également des cas supplémentaires liés aux éclosions dans trois hôpitaux :
-- Un patient supplémentaire dans une unité de l'hôpital communautaire Hants à Windsor; moins de cinq patients y ont contracté la COVID-19.
-- Un patient supplémentaire dans une unité de l'hôpital régional Cape Breton; 10 patients ont contracté la COVID-19.
-- Un patient supplémentaire dans une autre unité de l'hôpital régional Cape Breton; 12 patients ont contracté la COVID-19.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 6 mars 2022.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Six New Hospital Admissions, Four Discharges, Seven Deaths","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Six New Hospital Admissions, Four Discharges, Seven Deaths 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, February 28, Nova Scotia is reporting six new hospital admissions and four discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting seven deaths related to COVID-19: 
-- a man in his 30s in Central Zone
-- a man in his 60s in Central Zone
-- a woman in her 60s in Northern Zone
-- a man in his 70s in Northern Zone
-- a man in his 80s in Northern Zone
-- two women in their 80s in Central Zone.

Data on deaths comes from Panorama, public health’s disease information system. It is entered into the system only after the death is identified to be COVID-related, which can take days or weeks to investigate and report. The majority of data on deaths is reflective of virus activity in the past, at the point of infection, and not the situation today, at the point of reporting.

“Too many Nova Scotians have lost their lives because of this virus and my heart goes out to the families and loved ones left behind,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We know this virus can have devastating impacts. As we loosen restrictions, I ask Nova Scotians to be very mindful of their own health and take steps to protect yourself and those around you. Most importantly, stay home when you’re sick and follow public health advice for testing and isolation.”

There are 45 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 10 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is five to 92 years old. The median age is 59, and the median length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.6 days.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the Nova Scotians who have passed away,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “As we move towards living with COVID, it is important everyone understands Nova Scotia continues to see new cases. Please continue to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, stay home if you are feeling unwell, and follow the public health protocols in place to protect yourself and your communities.” 

Of the 45 people in hospital, 43 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 11 (24.4 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 20 (44.4 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 1 (2.2 per cent) is partially vaccinated
-- 13 (28.9 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 122 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 166 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of February 27, 2,212,224 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 92.1 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 86.7 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 62.3 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 0.6 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 1,941 tests February 25; 1,512 tests February 26; and 1,449 tests February 27. 

On February 26, there were 322 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported: 168 cases in Central Zone, 45 cases in Eastern Zone, 53 cases in Northern Zone and 56 cases in Western Zone. 

On February 27, there were 322 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported: 128 cases in Central Zone, 64 cases in Eastern Zone, 64 cases in Northern Zone and 66 cases in Western Zone.

An additional 243 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported today, February 28: 133 cases in Central Zone, 24 cases in Eastern Zone, 57 cases in Northern Zone and 29 cases in Western Zone.

There will be an increase in new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported. This is expected and is a result of people with positive rapid tests being able to get a confirmatory PCR test. New cases reported will now show a greater proportion of overall cases in the province.

As of today, there are an estimated 1,967 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Hospital Outbreaks:

NSHA is reporting additional cases related to the outbreaks in three hospitals:
-- one additional patient in a ward at Hants Community Hospital in Windsor; fewer than 10 patients have now tested positive
-- one additional patient in a ward at Cape Breton Regional Hospital; 10 patients have now tested positive
-- one additional patient in a separate ward at Cape Breton Regional Hospital; 12 patients have now tested positive.

Nova Scotia is donating $100,000 to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation to provide humanitarian aid and support to the people of Ukraine.

“Nova Scotians were shocked and horrified by Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which endangers the lives of people and flies in the face of international law,” said Premier Tim Houston. “When I spoke yesterday to Andre Mereshuk, President of the Nova Scotia Branch of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, he said a financial contribution is a way we could help. I am pleased to make this contribution to support the people of Ukraine and for Nova Scotia’s Ukrainian community in their time of need.”

Nova Scotia’s donation will provide support for humanitarian purposes, including medical aid, emergency shelter and food.

In addition to monetary support, and in response to measures taken by the federal government, Nova Scotia will also expedite immigration applications for Ukrainians.

Beginning today, February 25, Province House will fly the Ukrainian flag as a show of solidarity and support. There are more than 9,000 people of Ukrainian heritage living in Nova Scotia.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province will ensure all volunteer firefighters who responded to at least 20 per cent of emergency calls in 2021 will be eligible for a $500 refundable tax credit. 

The government is amending regulations to the Volunteer Firefighters and Ground Search and Rescue Tax Credit to waive the requirement for volunteer firefighters to attend 20 per cent of meetings and training sessions in person.
 
“The pandemic has made it challenging to maintain regular schedules but that has not altered the ongoing commitment of volunteer firefighters and search and rescue teams to keep Nova Scotians safe,” said Allan MacMaster, Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. “We want to ensure volunteer firefighters are still able to qualify for this tax credit that recognizes their dedication to helping protect their communities.”

The requirement did not apply to ground search and rescue workers, who will continue to be eligible for the credit as usual. The change now applies for the 2020 and 2021 tax years. 

Quick Facts: 
-- the Province administers a refundable personal income tax credit to volunteer firefighters and search and rescue personnel in recognition of their community service 
-- this $500 credit may be claimed by an individual on their 2021 tax return 
-- an estimated 7,400 volunteers in the province benefit from the credit each year

"Justice","Adult Capacity and Decision-making Act Review Complete","JUSTICE--Adult Capacity and Decision-making Act Review Complete
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province has completed its review of the Adult Capacity and Decision-making Act. It was filed with the legislature clerk's office today, February 25.

The Adult Capacity and Decision-making Act applies to adults who are unable to make some or all decisions for themselves because of a learning disability, mental illness, brain injury or other reasons. This law respects the rights of adults to make their own decisions, while allowing another trusted adult to make important decisions for them when they cannot. 

The review makes 26 recommendations to improve support for adults who need help making important decisions in their lives. 

“I want to thank all stakeholders and staff for the considerable time and effort they contributed to the review of this important legislation. The experience, advice and insights they shared with government during the review process is greatly appreciated,” said Minister of Justice Brad Johns. “Improving this legislation to make it work better for those it is intended to help is a shared goal.”

The recommendations address harmonizing Nova Scotia’s capacity legislation, education and assistance, the application process under the act, capacity assessments, and supported decision-making, which is when adults make their own decisions about their lives sometimes with help from a person or group of people they choose. 

To inform the review, the government consulted Nova Scotians, reviewed court files and convened an external advisory panel. 

The multi-department working group that led the review will develop an action plan to implement the recommendations. 

Both the report on the review of the Adult Capacity and Decision-making Act and the What We Heard report on the consultation that informed the review process are available online.

Quick Facts:
-- the legislation, which came into effect at the end of 2017, required the Minister of Justice to review its effectiveness
-- the public consultation included a survey and focus groups with affected stakeholders; 190 surveys were completed and 18 focus groups were held with a total of 130 participants
-- Horizons Community Development Associates Inc. was hired to conduct the consultation and gather information from Nova Scotians including adults with cognitive challenges and their appointed representatives, disability organizations, members of the legal community, academics, health professionals, seniors’ organizations and others

----------------------------------------------------------
Seven Nova Scotian seafood companies are sharpening their competitive edge by certifying under the Nova Scotia Seafood Quality Program, with more encouraged to sign up. 

Certified companies with high-quality products will be more competitive by meeting or exceeding the highest globally recognized standards around seafood quality, sustainability and traceability.

“By strengthening their quality standards, companies can provide sustainability, quality, food safety, and healthy options that influence buying decisions in the global market,” said Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Steve Craig. “Certification raises the profile of Nova Scotian seafood companies and their products in a market that is fast-changing and competitive.”

The Nova Scotia Seafood Quality Program promotes high quality standards within the seafood supply chain and aims to enhance Nova Scotia seafood's reputation for premium quality. 

Certified companies are recognized as Nova Scotia Seafood Ambassadors and receive many promotional benefits. Certified companies gain access to the Nova Scotia seafood brand marketing materials and trademarked logo for use in their own marketing, become recommended suppliers on the Province’s seafood marketing website and can be included in strategic marketing promotions throughout the year.

The seven companies that have received certification so far are:
-- North Bay Fisherman’s Cooperative

The government is seeking input on the final phase of draft regulations for the Traffic Safety Act.

Nova Scotians can now provide feedback on proposed regulations on weights and dimensions of all vehicles including trucks, buses, trailers and other vehicles. The proposed regulations focus on the width, length, height and weight, as well as the required number of axles.

Highlights of this phase of regulations include:

Nova Scotians can review the draft regulations and provide feedback at: https://novascotia.ca/traffic-safety-act-public-engagement/ . The deadline for feedback is March 31.

This is the eighth and final set of draft regulations being shared for public comment. To date, the Department has received almost 2,000 comments on the draft regulations previously released.

The new Traffic Safety Act, replacing the Motor Vehicle Act, was passed in 2018. The new act will govern and regulate the registration and identification of motor vehicles and the use of provincial highways and roads. This includes driver licences, the registration and inspection of vehicles, traffic laws and equipment standards.

The act will come into effect after the regulations are finalized and the new Registry of Motor Vehicles computer system is completed.

Quick Facts:
-- the Traffic Safety Act was passed unanimously in the fall of 2018 and will replace the Motor Vehicle Act, which was written in the early 1920s

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Restrictions Easing Next Week, Fully Lifted on March 21","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Restrictions Easing Next Week, Fully Lifted on March 21 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is moving up the timeline for easing public health restrictions and will end all restrictions on March 21.

“The restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic are a balancing act between keeping people safe and preventing other harms, and we knew we wouldn’t need them forever,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Now, it’s time to stop pulling the big levers, like broad restrictions, and shift to personal actions and responsibility. We all know what to do to protect ourselves and one another, and it’s time to get back to the people and things we love.”

On Monday, February 28, Phase 1 of the Province’s reopening plan will be adjusted to end the current requirement to show proof of full vaccination before participating in non-essential, discretionary events and activities. Other restrictions continue.

On Monday, March 7, at 12:01 a.m., Phase 2 will begin with the following restrictions in effect:

Gathering Limits
-- the informal gathering limit will be 25 people from the same household or close social group indoors and 50 outdoors
-- the formal gathering limit will be 75 per cent capacity, with physical distancing as much as possible, for gatherings hosted by a recognized business or organization such as special events, sports, receptions, performances, movie theatres, meetings, training, weddings, funerals and faith gatherings
-- large venues can operate at 75 per cent capacity, up to 5,000 people, with physical distancing as much as possible.

Businesses
-- licensed establishments, restaurants and casinos can return to regular hours and operate at 75 per cent capacity, with physical distancing as much as possible
-- VLTs can continue operating with two metres of physical distance between people at machines
-- fitness and recreation facilities and recreation and leisure businesses can operate at 75 per cent capacity, with physical distancing as much as possible
-- personal services businesses (like hair salons, barber shops, spas, nail salons and body art establishments) can operate at full capacity, with physical distancing as much as possible; services that require removing masks can be offered
-- retail stores and malls can operate at full capacity (shoppers and staff) with physical distancing

Sports; Arts and Culture
-- sports teams can have practices, games, competitions and tournaments with up to 60 participants, including players and officials; spectators are allowed, following the formal gathering limit
-- performing arts can have rehearsals, performances and competitions with up to 60 participants, including performers and crew; spectators are allowed, following the formal gathering limit
-- libraries and museums can operate at full capacity, with physical distancing.

Masks
-- masks continue to be required in indoor public places; they can be lowered or removed for things like eating and drinking or doing a physical activity that’s difficult while wearing a mask
-- people can resume lowering their masks to eat or drink in their seats at sports games, movies, concerts and other events.

During Phase 2, people who test positive for COVID-19 will still be required to self-isolate but they will no longer be required to notify close contacts outside their own household.

At acute-care and long-term care facilities, restrictions on visitation and in other areas will be determined through infection control and occupational health processes at each facility.

At public schools, current restrictions will remain in place until the end of March break.

Phase 3 – the removal of all provincial COVID-19 restrictions, including at schools – will begin March 21.

The changes in restrictions will be updated at: https://novascotia.ca/reopening-plan 

“This does not mean COVID-19 is gone,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “There is still lots of virus in communities and as we lift restrictions, our choices and actions become even more important. They will be the tools that we have to limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect those around us who are more vulnerable.”

In addition to the changes in restrictions, the last daily news release on COVID-19 data will be issued March 4. It will be replaced by a weekly release.

The government is offering a reward of up to $150,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the homicide of Joseph (JoJo) Beals. 

On February 20, 2021, members of the Halifax Regional Police responded to a report of a motor vehicle accident on Mount Edward Road in Dartmouth. Their investigation revealed the driver of the vehicle had been shot, causing a collision. Joseph Beals was transported to hospital where he died.

"Premier's Office / Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness","Province Recognized for Reducing Red Tape for Physicians","PREMIER’S OFFICE/REGULATORY AFFAIRS/SERVICE EFFECTIVENESS--Province Recognized for Reducing Red Tape for Physicians
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia continues to lead the country in reducing red tape. The Province was recognized today, February 23, with a Canadian Federation of Independent Business Golden Scissors Award for demonstrating leadership in removing administrative barriers for physicians.

“Fixing our healthcare system will take innovative solutions and cutting red tape for physicians is an important step,” said Premier Tim Houston, Minister of the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness. “Frontline healthcare workers from Yarmouth to Sydney have told me that they are tired of time-consuming administrative barriers and want them addressed. I am encouraged by the progress in this area. Our team will build on this work and make our regulatory system smarter and more efficient for everyone.”

Reducing unnecessary physician administrative burden, led by the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness, is being achieved through:
-- collaborating with Doctors Nova Scotia and the Department of Community Services to improve the form physicians use to help patients apply for the Employment Support and Income Assistance program
-- Nova Scotia Health moving the physician on-call program to MSI for administration, significantly reducing processing times for payments 
-- Nova Scotia Health making it easier for emergency department, intensive care unit and critical care physicians to work in other areas of the province, increasing accessibility to these services in rural areas.

“Reducing red tape for our physicians gives them more time to do what they do best – care for patients,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “I want to thank our hard-working physicians for taking time to share their experiences and solutions to reducing unnecessary administrative burden. There is much more left to do to improve the regulatory environment for doctors, and we’re committed to doing it.”

The office has set Canada’s first burden-reduction target of 50,000 hours, the equivalent of 150,000 patient visits, for unnecessary physician administrative work, to be achieved by 2024.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s annual Golden Scissors Award recognizes people and governments who excel in red tape reduction. This year, Nova Scotia is one of two recipients.

Quotes: 
“Reducing red tape for our province’s physicians creates a ripple effect and helps improve our healthcare system at large. By improving the regulatory system for physicians, we make it easier to work, start and manage a practice.”
     - Fred Crooks, Chief Regulatory Officer, Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness

“This is important work and I’m happy to see that it’s getting the attention it deserves. We are proud to be partners in this work and I applaud government’s commitment to make real progress in reducing the unnecessary administrative burden faced by physicians.”
     - Nancy MacCready-Williams, CEO, Doctors Nova Scotia

Quick Facts: 
-- a survey of 500 physicians conducted with the support of Doctors Nova Scotia found that physicians in Nova Scotia collectively spend over 500,000 hours per year – the equivalent of 1.5 million patient visits – on unnecessary paperwork
-- the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s Red Tape Awareness Week is February 21 through 25

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Photos from the portrait unveiling are available at: https://news.novascotia.ca/photos/2022/02/22/yvonne-atwell-portrait-ceremony-province-house
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A portrait of Yvonne Atwell, the first female African Nova Scotian to sit in the House of Assembly, was unveiled today, February 22, at Province House in Halifax.

The installation commemorates the historical significance of her election as the member for Preston in 1998.

“Yvonne Atwell’s election in 1998 marked an important milestone for the representation of women of colour in Nova Scotia’s democratic institutions,” said Keith Bain, Speaker of the House of Assembly. “The installation of her portrait commemorates and honours Ms. Atwell’s historic achievement. This commemoration is particularly significant during African Heritage Month – a time to educate ourselves and reflect upon and celebrate the significant contributions of African Nova Scotians to the province.”

Ms. Atwell’s portrait joins those of many prominent figures in the history of the province on display throughout Province House, including: 
-- the Premiers of Nova Scotia
-- Donald Marshall Sr. – Grand Chief of the Mi’kmaq Nation, 1964-1991
-- William Hall – the first Nova Scotian and the first person of African descent to be awarded the Victoria Cross
-- Wayne Adams – the first African Nova Scotian to be elected to the House of Assembly and the first African Nova Scotian to be appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia.

Quotes:
“Yvonne Atwell’s portrait is a wonderful and deserving addition to Province House. It is a representation of true Nova Scotian excellence, and it will serve as a reminder that our democracy – and this legislature – belongs to everyone. This is something that we, Nova Scotians, must remember.”
     - Pat Dunn, Minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs

"Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness","Province Marks Red Tape Awareness Week","REGULATORY AFFAIRS/SERVICE EFFECTIVENESS--Province Marks Red Tape Awareness Week
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is marking the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s Red Tape Awareness Week from February 21 to 25. It is a time to acknowledge and celebrate the ways governments of all levels can work to reduce red tape for businesses and citizens.

Recent red tape cutting initiatives include:
-- partnering with Nova Scotia Health to make it easier for emergency room, intensive care unit and critical care physicians to work in other areas of the province
-- introducing bypass technology that allows transport trucks to communicate with weigh stations and mobile carrier inspection sites so drivers have to stop less often, which increases the efficiency of transporting goods across the province and reduces costs, saving businesses an estimated $8.9 million annually
-- streamlining regional land use planning regulations between Cape Breton and Antigonish municipalities, making residents’ and developers’ interactions with government easier and faster
-- moving residential tenancies applications and payments online, which speeds processing times for tenants and landlords and saves them an estimated $34,000 annually
-- launching the Remembrance Day assessment tool, making it easier for businesses and their employees to understand how to observe November 11.

A full list of burden reduction measures can be found in the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness’ 2021 annual report.

Quotes: 
“Nova Scotia has been a leader in improving its regulatory environment and we at CFIB are committed to supporting its work to ensure this leadership continues. The team at the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness plays an important role in leading, co-ordinating and partnering to bring thoughtful solutions to complex problems that achieve impactful results.”
     - Louis-Philippe Gauthier, Senior Director, Legislative Affairs (Atlantic), Canadian Federation of Independent Business

“Improving how government regulates helps create the right environment for the growing number of people and businesses who call Nova Scotia home. I’m proud of the progress our team has made with our partners this past year. We’re ready and eager to take on new challenges in 2022.”
     - Fred Crooks, Chief Regulatory Officer, Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness

Quick Facts: 
-- a total of $10,172,000 of estimated annual savings to businesses through red tape reduction initiatives was achieved in 2021

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nearly two years ago, our province experienced a horrific event.

When the news broke, disbelief and heartbreak were felt in every home and community across the province. This soon spread to include homes across the country and around the globe.

To this day, we grapple with the impacts, and we continue to mourn the loss of those who were senselessly killed.

We came together in this time of grief. We reached out to families, friends and neighbours in support and in an effort to try and make sense of what had happened.

Today, February 22, the Mass Casualty Commission begins a series of public hearings. The hearings are part of an inquiry to find answers about what happened and why it happened. These hearings will feature testimony from numerous witnesses who will speak to the horrific events.

At times, what we hear will be sad or disturbing. Everyone will process what they’re hearing in different ways. Feelings of sadness, anxiety and fear are normal and are to be expected. But you don’t have to process these feelings on your own. I want you to know you are not alone.

If you just need to talk to someone or if you need help, there are places to go and people to listen any time, day or night.

211 Nova Scotia has community support navigators standing by 24/7 and can connect you with someone who can help.

Additional services and community resources can be found at: https://novascotia.ca/mental-health-and-wellbeing/

I encourage you to make use of these resources, whether for yourself or to navigate how to help someone else.

Please keep yourself well and, as you have done before, check in on your family, friends and neighbours. Please be kind to one another.

To the families and communities who lost loved ones, your province continues to support you in your journey to healing.

"Premier's Office","Statement on the Mass Casualty Inquiry","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Statement on the Mass Casualty Inquiry
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a statement from Premier Tim Houston on the Mass Casualty Inquiry. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
This week marks the beginning of the inquiry into the April 18 and 19, 2020, mass casualty that took the lives of 22 Nova Scotians and an unborn child.

We must never lose sight of the reason for this public inquiry, to seek answers that lead to change and improve public safety. 

Over the course of the last few weeks, I have heard family members express frustration and concern about the structure of the inquiry. They feel left in the dark. This is not only disrespectful, it should cause us all to pause and ask, if the families don’t have confidence in the process, how can the public?

The reason Nova Scotians pulled together and pushed for an inquiry as opposed to a review was to ensure that it was honest, comprehensive, detailed and most importantly, designed to answer questions. Yet, it is still not even known if key witnesses have been subpoenaed to testify, if there will be an opportunity to cross-examine them or if it will be a comprehensive list of witnesses. This uncertainty is causing further, unnecessary trauma.

For these reasons, the commission should meet with the families and their counsel to listen to their concerns and provide them with a plan that gives them confidence in the process.

To the families of:
-- Tom Bagley
-- Kristen Beaton
-- Baby Beaton
-- Greg Blair
-- Jamie Blair
-- Joy Bond
-- Peter Bond
-- Lillian Campbell
-- Corrie Ellison
-- Gina Goulet

-- Sean McLeod

-- Heather O'Brien
-- Const. Heidi Stevenson
-- Elizabeth Joanne Thomas
-- Aaron Tuck
-- Emily Tuck
-- Jolene Oliver

-- John Zahl

As Premier, I stand with you.

Together, we will continue to push for answers.

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","New Record for Highest Number of Landed Immigrants in a Year","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--New Record for Highest Number of Landed Immigrants in a Year
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia welcomed 9,020 permanent residents in 2021 – a record-breaking number that surpassed the previous high by 19 per cent.

“Nova Scotia is a welcoming province filled with opportunities, and it has helped us become one million strong,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “Newcomers help to fill labour needs, fuel our economy, create new businesses and jobs and enhance our quality of life. We are so glad that they have chosen Nova Scotia to be their home.”

The previous record for landed immigrants in a year was set in 2019 when 7,580 immigrants became permanent residents. In 2020, that number dropped to 3,510, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at immigration totals pre-pandemic, the number of permanent landings has nearly doubled in less than five years – there were 4,515 landings in 2017.

Nova Scotia continues to successfully attract newcomers through innovative immigration programs and solutions, such as the Atlantic Immigration Program. The program has been so successful since it was introduced in 2017, the Province and the Government of Canada recently announced it would be a permanent pathway for designated employers to hire skilled workers.

Immigrants and their families who come to Nova Scotia have access to wrap-around settlement supports at service providers throughout the province. This can include language services, training and employment supports, and connections to community groups and services. As a result of this work, Nova Scotia’s retention rate is the highest in Atlantic Canada at 71 per cent.

Nova Scotia is aiming to double its population to two million by 2060 with a goal to attract 25,000 newcomers per year. Through strategic immigration efforts and migration from other parts of Canada, the Province is attracting professionals who are meeting provincial labour needs in sectors such as healthcare and skilled trades.

Quotes:
“ISANS is proud to support the continued record levels of immigration to Nova Scotia, which is critical to the growth and health of our province. Settlement services such as language, employment, and community integration supports are key to the effective engagement of immigrants in our workplaces and our communities. Through our programs and services, we welcome new talent, perspectives, and opportunities to the province. In 2021, several thousands of immigrants were supported and empowered by our settlement program and services, helping to chart a pathway towards long-term success. We look forward to continuing our work with departments such as Labour, Skills, and Immigration to foster a community where all can belong and grow while we build a bright future for immigrants in Nova Scotia.”
     - Jennifer Watts, CEO, Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia (ISANS)

“I came to Nova Scotia through the Economic Mobility Pathways Project. I am an internationally educated nurse working as a continuing care assistant in New Glasgow. I’ve been in Nova Scotia for seven months and I’m loving the nature, clean environment, peace, quiet and the many recreational activities offered here in the province. Currently, I’m working to gain my certification equality, so I can work as a registered nurse and continue to help Nova Scotians in need.”
     - Lamis Alhassan, 2021 newcomer to Nova Scotia 

Quick Facts:
-- in 2021, the top five countries of origin for immigrants to Nova Scotia were India, China, Philippines, South Korea and Nigeria
-- from 2015 to the end of 2021, the Province approved 1,542 registered nurses and continuing care assistants – they are the top two healthcare professions approved by Labour, Skills and Immigration
-- 1,818 international graduates were approved to stay and live in Nova Scotia after their studies in 2021
-- last year was Nova Scotia’s sixth year of increased inter-provincial migration with nearly 10,000 net new people coming to Nova Scotia from other provinces and territories
-- according to Statistics Canada, Nova Scotia’s population now exceeds one million, after reaching the milestone in December

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Province Provides Stable Funding to Child-Care Centres, Additional One-Time Grant","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Province Provides Stable Funding to Child-Care Centres, Additional One-Time Grant 
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: An op-ed from Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, follows the news release.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Child-care providers across the province will receive additional financial supports as part of their annual funding agreement with the Province this year. 

Announced today, February 18, the additional funding will offset the 25 per cent fee reductions for parents. It also includes a one-time grant to support the freeze on parent fees.

The new agreement will be offered to all child-care providers, including licensed centres that were previously unfunded or partially funded. By accepting the new agreement, centres will have access to the additional supports from the Province. The government’s total investment in the one-time grant is $1 million.

The fee reductions have led to increased interest from families in child care, and the new agreement contains a commitment from operators to accept children where they can.  

“We’ve heard from many operators, early childhood educators and families,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Together, we will provide Nova Scotian families with affordable child care of the highest quality. We will work with our operators to build a system that cares for all Nova Scotians – children, families, ECEs, operators.”

To ensure voices in the sector are heard, the Province is creating a table to advise the Minister on the transformation of child care. More details will be released in the coming weeks.

As announced in January, through the Nova Scotia Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, families in Nova Scotia will see a 25 per cent reduction, on average, in child-care fees as of April 1, 2022, retroactive to January 1, 2022, for children in regulated child-care spaces. This reduction means a savings, on average, of $200 per month for parents with a toddler in child care. This is an initial step in reducing child-care fees for Nova Scotian families by 50 per cent, on average, by the end of 2022, and in achieving an average of $10-a-day care by March 31, 2026.

Work continues on Nova Scotia’s Excellence in Early Childhood Education workforce strategy, which will result in higher wages and benefits for early childhood educators by fall 2022.

Quick Facts:
- licensed operators will be asked to sign the new funding agreement by April 1, 2022; the agreement is largely reflective of previous funding agreements, with additional funding to offset parent-fee reductions and the one-time grant to support rising operational costs
-- the initial decrease in parent fees of 25 per cent, on average, will be retroactive to January 1, 2022; parents will continue to pay their current rate until April 1, when they will then pay the reduced rate and choose whether to receive a cheque from their centre reflecting the reduction from January to March, or a credit
-- the Government of Canada is making a transformative investment to build a Canada-wide early learning and child care system in partnership with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners; this includes a historic federal investment of $605 million for Nova Scotia from 2021-2022 to 2025-2026, in addition to a one-time investment of about $10.9 million in 2021-2022 to support Nova Scotia’s early childhood workforce
-- Nova Scotia invests $132.6 million in early learning and child care annually, including $54 million for pre-primary and over $75 million for the child care sector
-- there are 330 licensed child-care centres in Nova Scotia and 14 licensed Family Home Child Care Agencies

MINISTER’S OP-ED: Child Care that Cares for Everyone

As a parent, I understand the challenges families face when they need child care. Availability, cost, access to quality care — these are all real barriers and hurdles for Nova Scotia families. 

The needs of families — the families accessing care today and the families looking for care in the future — are at the heart of the work currently underway to transform our child-care system through the Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement.  

The agreement supports a five-year journey to reduce daily fees for regulated child care to $10 per day, on average, to give families access to child care when and where they need it, and to ensure child-care providers are compensated fairly as they provide high quality care for our youngest Nova Scotians. We are building a system of child care that cares for everyone: families, children, early childhood educators and operators. 

We need to realize this vision with the people who have the expertise, knowledge and passion to deliver high quality child care. I have committed to bring together people from the child-care community across Nova Scotia to ensure that the people who know this sector best provide input as we build the future of child care for Nova Scotians.

I want to assure the sector that we heard you and we listened. The Province will provide stable funding to offset the 25 per cent fee reductions for parents and a one-time grant to alleviate pressures facing child-care operators during this transition period. 

We recognize and value the important role private operators, non-profit operators, and early childhood educators play in caring for our children. We want all operators to succeed and have the opportunity to become part of a historic system that serves children, families and the economy. 

We remain committed to the principles of the agreement to ensure that Nova Scotians have high quality child care that is accessible, affordable and inclusive — child care that cares for everyone.

"Community Services","Ouverture des dossiers d'adoption le 1er mai","SERVICES COMMUNAUTAIRES--Ouverture des dossiers d'adoption le 1er mai 
---------------------------------------------------------
Les dossiers d'adoptions seront ouverts en Nouvelle-Écosse à compter du 1er mai.

À cette date, le Programme de divulgation de la Province acceptera les demandes en vertu de la loi sur les dossiers d'adoption (Adoption Records Act). La loi permet aux personnes adoptées, lorsqu'elles ont 19 ans, et aux parents biologiques, d'accéder à leurs renseignements s'ils le souhaitent.

« Puisque la loi entrera en vigueur le 1er mai, il est important pour toute personne qui souhaite protéger ses renseignements personnels d'être au courant de cette date, affirme Karla MacFarlane, ministre des Services communautaires. J'encourage les gens qui souhaitent protéger leurs renseignements personnels à déposer un veto à la divulgation ou un avis sur la prise de contact. J'encourage également tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui ont des questions ou des inquiétudes à communiquer avec le personnel du Programme de divulgation pour en discuter. »

Un veto à la divulgation est un document qui indique qu'une personne adoptée ou un parent biologique ne souhaite pas que l'on divulgue des renseignements qui permettraient de l'identifier. Un avis sur la prise de contact permet à une personne de divulguer ses renseignements identificatoires en précisant sa préférence sur la façon dont on peut communiquer avec elle ou qu'elle ne souhaite pas qu'on communique avec elle.

Au 1er mai, ces outils de protection des renseignements personnels continueront d'être offerts si les renseignements sur l'adoption n'ont pas déjà été divulgués.  
 
En vertu de la nouvelle loi, les personnes qui avaient déjà demandé que leurs renseignements soient confidentiels doivent quand même remplir un outil de protection des renseignements personnels.

Faits en bref
-- Au 15 février, le Programme de divulgation a reçu un total de 192 outils de protection des renseignements personnels (vetos à la divulgation et avis sur la prise de contact).

------------------------------------------------------
Adoption records will become open in Nova Scotia on May 1.

At that time, the Province’s Disclosure Program will begin accepting applications under the Adoption Records Act. This legislation allows adopted people, once they turn 19, and birth parents to access their information if they want to.

“Given that the legislation will take effect on May 1st, it’s important that those who want their information protected are aware of the date,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “I encourage people who wish to protect their privacy to file a disclosure veto or contact notice. I also encourage Nova Scotians who may have questions or concerns to reach out to Disclosure Program staff to talk it through.”

A disclosure veto is a document stating an adopted person or a birth parent does not wish to share information that can identify them. With a contact notice, people share identifying information and state how they want to be contacted or that they don’t want to contacted.

As of May 1, these privacy tools will continue to be available if the adoption information has not already been shared.  
 
Under the new legislation, people who have previously indicated they want to keep their information private are still required to fill out a privacy tool.

Quick Facts:
-- as of February 15, the Disclosure Program had received a total of 192 privacy filings (disclosure vetoes and contact notices)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 17 février, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que 10 autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et que cinq personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également deux décès liés à la COVID-19 :
-- un quinquagénaire dans le secteur de l'est et
-- un septuagénaire également dans le secteur de l'est.

Les données sur les décès proviennent de Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique. Ces données sont entrées dans le système seulement lorsqu'il est déterminé que le décès est lié à la COVID-19. Cette enquête peut prendre quelques jours ou quelques semaines. Les données sur les décès reflètent l'activité virale dans le passé, soit au moment de l'infection, et non la situation actuelle, soit au moment du signalement.  

« C’est le coeur lourd que nous annonçons le décès de deux autres personnes des suites de la COVID-19, a indiqué le premier ministre Tim Houston. C’est une période extrêmement triste pour leur famille et leurs amis. Je transmets mes plus sincères condoléances aux personnes qui pleurent la perte d’un être cher. » 

À l’heure actuelle, 66 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 11 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 13 à 93 ans. L'âge médian est de 64 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,3 jours.

Parmi les 66 personnes hospitalisées, 62 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

« Le virus a emporté deux autres personnes de la Nouvelle-Écosse et je pense aux familles et aux proches de ces personnes et je prie pour eux, a souligné le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous savons que la COVID-19 peut-être une maladie grave et nous jouons tous un rôle dans la manière dont elle frappe nos collectivités. Il est important de continuer à nous soucier les uns des autres en nous faisant vacciner et en suivant les mesures de prévention de la Santé publique. » 

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 22 (33,3 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 24 (36,4 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 1 (1,5 %) n'a reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 19 (28,8 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que moins de 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Il y a également deux autres groupes de personnes à l’hôpital à cause de la COVID-19 :
-- 135 personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à leur arrivée à l'hôpital, mais ont été admises pour un autre problème de santé, ou elles ont été admises à cause de la COVID-19 mais n'ont plus besoin de soins spécialisés;
-- 166 personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 après avoir été admises à l’hôpital.

Vaccination

Au 16 février, 2 192 568 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. En Nouvelle-Écosse, 91,6 % des gens ont reçu leur première dose et 85,9 % ont reçu leur deuxième dose.

En outre, 61 % des gens de 18 ans et plus ont reçu une dose de rappel et 1,3 % ont pris rendez-vous pour la recevoir.

Cas et dépistage

Le 16 février, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 015 tests. On signale 242 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire.

Il y a 80 cas dans le secteur du centre, 67 dans le secteur de l'est, 50 dans le secteur du nord et 45 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'il y a 2 535 cas actifs de COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.
Éclosions dans les hôpitaux 

La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse signale une nouvelle éclosion dans une unité de l’hôpital régional Cape Breton. Moins de 10 patients y ont contracté la COVID-19.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","10 New Hospital Admissions, Five Discharges, Two Deaths","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--10 New Hospital Admissions, Five Discharges, Two Deaths
---------------------------------------------------------------
Today, February 17, Nova Scotia is reporting 10 new hospital admissions and five discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting two deaths related to COVID-19:
-- a man in his 50s in Eastern Zone
-- a man in his 70s in Eastern Zone.

Data on deaths comes from Panorama, public health’s disease information system. It is entered into the system only after the death is identified to be COVID-related, which can take days or weeks to investigate and report. Data on deaths is reflective of virus activity in the past, at the point of infection, and not the situation today, at the point of reporting. 

“It is with heavy hearts we report the passing of two more Nova Scotians to COVID-19,” said Premier Tim Houston. “This is an extremely sad time for their families and friends. I want to extend my deepest condolences to all those who are grieving the loss of their loved one.” 

There are 66 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 11 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 13 to 93 years old. The median age is 64, and the median length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.3 days.

Of the 66 people in hospital, 62 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

“This virus has taken the life of two more Nova Scotians and my thoughts and prayers are with their family and friends,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We know COVID-19 can be a serious disease, and we all play a role in how it impacts our communities. It is important we continue to take care of one another by getting vaccinated and following the public health guidance.” 

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 22 (33.3 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 24 (36.4 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 1 (1.5 per cent) is partially vaccinated
-- 19 (28.8 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 135 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 166 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of February 16, 2,192,568 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 91.6 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 85.9 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 61 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 1.3 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

On February 16, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 2,015 tests. An additional 242 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 80 cases in Central Zone, 67 cases in Eastern Zone, 50 cases in Northern Zone and 45 cases in Western Zone.

As of today, there are an estimated 2,535 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Hospital Outbreaks: 

NSHA is reporting a new outbreak in a ward at Cape Breton Regional Hospital. Fewer than 10 patients have tested positive.

NSHA is also reporting additional cases related to the outbreaks in four hospitals:
-- three additional patients in a ward at Cumberland Regional Health Care Centre in Amherst; a total of 13 patients have tested positive
-- two additional patients in a separate ward at Cape Breton Regional Hospital; fewer than 10 patients have tested positive 
-- one additional patient in a separate ward at Cape Breton Regional Hospital; fewer than 10 patients have tested positive
-- one additional patient in a ward at Hants Community Hospital in Windsor; fewer than 10 patients have tested positive.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to February 20, 2022

----------------------------------------------------------------
La Journée du patrimoine de 2022 célèbre le site du patrimoine mondial du Paysage de Grand-Pré, l'un des premiers établissements en Nouvelle-Écosse, empreint de l'histoire de l'Acadie et défini par la tragédie, le courage et la persévérance. 

La Journée du patrimoine a lieu le 21 février.

« Comme je suis moi-même Acadien, le Paysage de Grand-Pré est très spécial pour moi, affirme le lieutenant-gouverneur Arthur J. LeBlanc. Il s'agit d'une référence visuelle à la culture acadienne en Nouvelle-Écosse. L'endroit nous rappelle aussi le besoin de compassion et d'inclusion dans notre province. Éclairés par les leçons tirées de notre passé, nous nous engageons à bâtir une société où toutes les personnes peuvent vivre dans la dignité et la paix. »

Le Paysage de Grand-Pré s'étend sur 1 300 hectares de terres agricoles dans la vallée de l'Annapolis, où l'on trouve également des aboiteaux, soit l'utilisation de clapets dans les digues qui permettent l'écoulement des eaux de crue tout en empêchant l'eau de mer d'envahir les terres. Cette technologie novatrice a été créée par les Acadiens du 17e siècle avec le soutien vital des Mi'kmaq. Après la déportation des Acadiens au 18e siècle, les terres ont été entretenues et élargies par les Planters de la Nouvelle-Angleterre. Leurs descendants et autres intendants des terres ont assuré la fertilité continue de ces terres agricoles jusqu'à présent.

« La Journée du patrimoine 2022 est un rappel important des liens historiques profonds de notre province avec le peuple acadien depuis le début des années 1600, souligne Colton LeBlanc, ministre des Affaires acadiennes et de la Francophonie. Je suis un fier Acadien et je comprends bien l'importance de raconter l'histoire incroyable de notre peuple, dont les contributions ont joué un rôle fondamental dans la création et le maintien de communautés solides et prospères. En cette Journée du patrimoine, j'encourage tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à découvrir notre histoire et notre culture dynamique. »

Cette année marque le 10e anniversaire de l'inscription du Paysage de Grand-Pré à la liste des sites du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO. Le Paysage de Grand-Pré Inc. organisera des célébrations cet été.

Nous espérons que cette journée offrira une occasion de réfléchir à l'Acadie et encouragera des discussions à plus grande échelle sur les leçons qui peuvent être tirées de l'histoire, non seulement celle du peuple acadien, mais aussi celle de la Nouvelle-Écosse et de notre pays. »

----------------------------------------------------------------
Heritage Day 2022 will celebrate the Landscape of Grand Pré World Heritage Site, one of the earliest settlements in Nova Scotia, which is immersed with Acadian history and defined by tragedy, courage and perseverance. 

Heritage Day is Monday, February 21.

“As an Acadian myself, the Landscape of Grand Pré holds special meaning for me,” said Lt.-Gov Arthur J. LeBlanc. “It is a visual reference of Acadian culture in Nova Scotia. It also reminds us of the need for compassion and inclusion in our province. By taking lessons from our past, we commit to building a society where all individuals can live with dignity and peace.”

The Landscape of Grand Pré covers 1,300 hectares of Annapolis Valley farmland and includes the innovative aboiteau technology – the use of sluicegates in dykes that allow flood water to drain but keep sea water out – developed by 17th-century Acadians with the vital support of the Mi’kmaq. After the deportation of the Acadians in the 18th century, the area was maintained and expanded by the New England Planters. Their descendants and other stewards of the land have ensured the area has remained fertile agricultural land to the present day.

“Heritage Day 2022 serves as an important reminder of our province’s deep historical ties with the Acadian people since the early 1600s,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Acadian Affairs and Francophonie. “As a proud Acadian, I understand the significance of sharing the incredible stories of our people, whose contributions played a fundamental role in creating and maintaining strong and prosperous communities. This Heritage Day, I encourage all Nova Scotians to discover our vibrant culture and history.”

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the inscription of Landscape of Grand Pré becoming a UNESCO World Heritage site. Landscape of Grand Pré Inc. will hold celebrations this summer. 

Quotes: 
“Even though the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a challenge for many of us, it does not stop us from paying tribute to the outstanding people and places this province offers the world.”
     - Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage 

“By choosing the Landscape of Grand Pré for Nova Scotia’s Heritage Day, the Province is honouring the place of memory of the Acadian diaspora. We hope that this day provides an opportunity to reflect on Acadie and encourage broader discussions of the lessons to be learned from this history, which is not only that of the Acadian people but also that of all Nova Scotians and of our country.”  
     - Kenneth Deveau, président de la Fédération acadienne de la Nouvelle-Écosse 

“Landscape of Grand Pré Inc. is very pleased that the Province of Nova Scotia is honouring the Landscape of Grand Pré as part of Heritage Day celebrations. Located in the heart of the Mi’kmaw District of Sipekne'katik, it features an exceptional living agricultural community and iconic place of remembrance for the Acadian community.”
     - Beverly Palmeter, Board Chair, Landscape of Grand Pré Inc.

"Community Services","Addressing Homelessness in Rural Nova Scotia","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Addressing Homelessness in Rural Nova Scotia
-----------------------------------------------------------
Emergency interim funding will stabilize rural emergency shelters run by seven organizations across the province and ensure more access to housing and services this winter.

“Homelessness is not just an urban problem,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “We are making investments that ensure people experiencing homelessness have access to the help they need in all parts of the province. This funding will help organizations meet the growing community need for emergency housing and services.”

The following organizations will each receive $20,000 to fund housing support services and hotel rooms when shelters are at capacity or for people better served within a hotel environment:
-- Viola’s Place, New Glasgow
-- Cape Breton Community Housing Association, Sydney and Port Hawkesbury
-- YMCA Cumberland, Amherst
-- Truro Housing Outreach Society, Truro
-- South Shore Open Doors Association, Bridgewater
-- The Portal Youth Outreach Association, Kentville
-- A Roof Over Your Head, Antigonish.

In addition, the Pictou County Roots for Youth Society will receive $61,641 to reduce its reliance on volunteers and hire trained support staff skilled at helping vulnerable youth stabilize their lives as they transition to independence.

Quotes:
“This funding has the ability to save a life on a cold winter night when there is no shelter or housing available. Access to these funds offers the first step to navigating individuals closer to a safer and happier life that every human deserves.”
     - Lisa Deyoung, Manager, Viola’s Place

“Housing insecurity and homelessness has impacted the health and well-being of rural Nova Scotians for many years, and for many years, agencies have worked around the clock finding creative ways to stretch limited resources to keep people safe and housed. We are very thankful for the support from the Province of Nova Scotia and are confident this fund will increase our capacity to provide adequate resources for community members who find themselves in situations of housing insecurity and homelessness. We look to the future with excitement, as we continue to develop our relationship with the Province of Nova Scotia and the local community.”
     - Lisa Ryan, Executive Director, South Shore Open Doors Association

“We appreciate the partnership of Community Services in providing for those immediate sheltering and housing needs of members of our community. Sometimes, regular sources of funding like income assistance are not available or there are additional needs that cannot be accessed in a timely fashion. Emergency funding can make all the difference in making sure someone can stay safely accommodated, by preventing eviction or securing desperately needed funds for a young person, a family, or an adult.”
     - Russ Sanche, Executive Director, Portal Youth Outreach Association

“This funding will provide the foundation for the organization to change lives in Pictou County.”
     - Angie Degaust, Executive Director, Pictou County Roots for Youth

Quick Facts:
-- there are 225 shelter beds in Nova Scotia, including 71 outside Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM)
-- 25 shelter beds previously provided by Out of the Cold in Halifax have been transitioned to permanent supportive housing
-- emergency accommodations are available in HRM through the Province’s Shelter Diversion Support Program
-- Pictou County Roots for Youth operates a shelter for youth aged 14 to 24 at 603 East River Road in New Glasgow

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is providing new support for certain businesses and practitioners in the cosmetology sector through the Targeted Sector Impact Program.

The new program, announced today, February 17, will provide a one-time grant of $2,500 to help eligible businesses and practitioners directly impacted by the tightened mask requirements announced in December as part of the provincewide public health restrictions.

“The government is committed to listening to and working with the business community as we embark on our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development. “After working together with the cosmetology sector, we are responding to the call for support for those who were directly impacted by the tightened mask restrictions in December. This funding, along with the easing of restrictions this week, will help jump-start business activity in the sector.”

The Province will fund and administer the new program, which is expected to cost about $1 million depending on participation. Applications will open on February 25. 

Quick Facts:
-- the program will be available to applicants who earned at least 50 per cent of revenues during 2021 from eligible services (those that couldn’t be performed without the removal of masks)
-- applicants can apply for an additional $2,500 grant if they earned more than $45,000 in revenue from eligible services during November 2021 (proof required)
-- the government will continue working with the Cosmetology Association of Nova Scotia to finalize the program rollout

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 16 février, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que quatre autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et que neuf personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également trois décès supplémentaires liés à la COVID-19 qui ont eu lieu entre le 6 et le 12 février :
-- une femme dans la cinquantaine dans le secteur de l'est
-- une femme dans la soixantaine dans le secteur de l'ouest
-- un septuagénaire dans le secteur de l'est

Les données sur les décès proviennent de Panorama, le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique. Ces données sont entrées dans le système seulement lorsqu'il est déterminé que le décès est lié à la COVID-19. Cette enquête peut prendre quelques jours ou quelques semaines, et c'est pourquoi ces trois décès n'ont pas été signalés auparavant. Les données sur les décès reflètent l'activité virale dans le passé, soit au moment de l'infection, et non la situation actuelle, soit au moment du signalement. 

« Mes plus sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches des personnes qui sont décédées en raison de la COVID-19, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Il s'agit d'un triste rappel de l'impact dévastateur continu de cette maladie sur les gens, les familles et les communautés. » 

À l'heure actuelle, 66 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, neuf sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 0 à 93 ans. L'âge médian est de 62 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,2 jours.

Parmi les 66 personnes hospitalisées, 63 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

« Aujourd'hui, trois autres familles vivent une perte inimaginable, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Depuis le début de cette pandémie, la COVID-19 continue d'affecter les personnes les plus vulnérables de notre province de façon disproportionnée. C'est pourquoi il est tellement important de se préoccuper les uns des autres. La meilleure façon de se protéger et de protéger les autres est de se faire vacciner, de rester à la maison si on ne se sent pas bien et de respecter les mesures sanitaires qui sont en place. » 

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 19 (28,8 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 24 (36,4 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 1 (1,5 %) n'a reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 22 (33,3 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que moins de 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Il y a également deux autres groupes de personnes à l'hôpital à cause de la COVID-19 :
-- 131 personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à leur arrivée à l'hôpital mais ont été admises pour une autre raison de santé, ou elles ont été admises à cause de la COVID-19 mais n'ont plus besoin de soins spécialisés;
-- 164 personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 après avoir été admises à l'hôpital.

Vaccination

Au 15 février, 2 188 378 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. En Nouvelle-Écosse, 91,6 % des gens ont reçu leur première dose et 85,8 % ont reçu leur deuxième dose.

En outre, 60,3 % des gens de 18 ans et plus ont reçu une dose de rappel et 1,8 % ont pris rendez-vous pour recevoir leur dose de rappel.

Cas et dépistage

Le 15 février, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 1 734 tests. On signale 223 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire.

Il y a 62 cas dans le secteur du centre, 70 dans le secteur de l'est, 36 dans le secteur du nord et 55 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'il y a 2 572 cas actifs de COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Éclosions dans les hôpitaux 

La Régie de la santé signale de nouvelles éclosions dans des unités à l'hôpital général de Dartmouth et à l'hôpital général de Digby. Moins de cinq patients dans chaque établissement ont contracté la COVID-19.

La Régie signale également des cas supplémentaires liés aux éclosions dans quatre hôpitaux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, February 16, Nova Scotia is reporting four new hospital admissions and nine discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting three additional deaths related to COVID-19 that occurred between February 6 and 12:
-- a woman in her 50s in Eastern Zone
-- a woman in her 60s in Western Zone
-- a man in his 70s in Eastern Zone.

Data on deaths comes from Panorama, public health’s disease information system. It is entered into the system only after the death is identified to be COVID-related, which can take days or weeks to investigate and report. This is why these three deaths were not reported previously. Data on deaths is reflective of virus activity in the past, at the point of infection, and not the situation today, at the point of reporting. 

“My heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the people who lost their lives to COVID-19,” said Premier Tim Houston. “It is a painful reminder of the devastating impact this disease continues to have on individuals, families and communities.”

“Today, three more families are grieving an unimaginable loss,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “From the start of this pandemic, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the most vulnerable people in our communities – and that has not changed. That’s why it’s still so important to take care of one another. And the best way to do that is to get vaccinated, stay home if you’re sick, and follow the public health guidance in place to keep everyone safe.”

"Advanced Education","COVID-19 Grant to Help Eligible Post-Secondary Students","COVID-19/ADVANCED EDUCATION--COVID-19 Grant to Help Eligible Post-Secondary Students
---------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of eligible post-secondary students will receive a one-time COVID-19 grant of $875 to help them pay their bills.

About 11,000 students who receive Nova Scotia Student Assistance qualify. The grant, which will not have to be repaid, represents a $9.8-million investment in post-secondary students.

“We know the pandemic has been very difficult in many ways for post-secondary students. We also know many students haven’t been able to access part-time employment to help pay for school due to COVID measures,” said Advanced Education Minister Brian Wong. “I am committed to reducing barriers and finding solutions to help post-secondary students be successful. This investment provides immediate relief for thousands of Nova Scotia students with the highest need while we continue to work with our partners to assist students.”

To be eligible for the one-time grant, post-secondary students must be a Nova Scotia resident and qualify for and receive Nova Scotia Student Assistance.

Students do not have to apply. The grant money will be automatically deposited into eligible students’ bank accounts in March.

Quotes:
“One of the biggest challenges that students are facing right now is the rising cost of expenses for things like food and housing. This investment in students could not have come at a more critical time, especially with all the added costs related to the pandemic. This extra money will help many students focus on their studies instead of wondering how they will pay the next bill.”
     - Ben Fairhurst, Chair, Students Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:

"Office of Addictions and Mental Health","New Recovery Support Centre Open in New Glasgow","ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--New Recovery Support Centre Open in New Glasgow
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Expanded addiction recovery supports are now available for people in Pictou County struggling with substance use and gambling addictions.

A new recovery support centre opened Monday, February 14, in Aberdeen Hospital in New Glasgow. The centre expands on the withdrawal management services that had been based in the Town of Pictou, with space to offer both inpatient and day programs.  

The centre is part of the Province’s new recovery support model. It will provide on-site withdrawal support and link people to other levels of care based on their individual needs, such as opioid-use disorder treatment and community mental health and addictions programs.

“Nova Scotians struggling with addictions deserve to have access to the support and treatment options they need,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Opening the centre in Aberdeen Hospital is an important step in the right direction, and I look forward to opening more recovery support centres across the province.""

On-site supports at the new centre include education, recovery and harm reduction, and individual and group recovery. Inpatient withdrawal management will be added in the coming months.

“This centre provides enhanced support to residents of Pictou County who are living with addictions,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “Having both inpatient and day programs will allow us to better meet the care needs of people where they are in their recovery journey and provide opportunities for those with lower intensity needs to recover while remaining at home and in their community.”

The centre is staffed by an interdisciplinary team, including nurse practitioners, physicians, nurses, social workers, peer support workers and administrative staff.

People can make an appointment for supports and services by calling the Mental Health and Addictions Intake Service at 1-855-922-1122, Monday to Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Referrals will also come through family physicians, emergency departments and community mental health and addiction clinics.

This is the second centre to open under the new recovery support model. The first opened in Dartmouth in January. In total, 10 recovery support centres will be set up across the province over the next two years. Five existing withdrawal management sites in Lunenburg, Middleton, Strait-Richmond, Sydney and Yarmouth will evolve to the recovery support model. New centres will also be set up in Truro, North Sydney and Halifax.

Quotes:
“People who have difficulty with substance use and addictive behavior have needs for support that are at times complex and time sensitive. This recovery support centre will build on our existing system of mental health and addiction care in ways that are responsive and holistic, meeting the needs of the community for some of the most vulnerable.”
     - Dr. Dave Martell, Physician Lead, Addictions Medicine, Mental Health and Addictions Program, Nova Scotia Health

“We were pleased to provide funding support for a number of the centre’s carefully considered trauma-informed features. It’s clear the team has put much thought into creating a space that support the needs of those accessing care. We look forward to continuing to work with and provide sustained support to people on their path to recovery.”
     - Michelle Ferris, Executive Director, Aberdeen Health Foundation

"Health and Wellness","New Equipment Modernizes Ambulance Fleet","HEALTH/WELLNESS--New Equipment Modernizes Ambulance Fleet
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is investing another $3.5 million to install state-of-the-art equipment in more ambulances in Nova Scotia, making them safer for patients and paramedics.

The purchase of 78 power stretchers and 65 power loaders means that by the end of the year all Emergency Health Services (EHS) ambulances and patient transfer units will be outfitted with this modern technology.

“Nova Scotians should be able to count on our emergency medical system for urgent care and much, much more,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “This new technology will help paramedics provide life-saving medical treatment anytime, anywhere, and make the experience safer and more comfortable for patients.”

Power stretchers and power loaders allow patients to be lifted into ambulances with the push of a button. The equipment will be delivered over the next six weeks from the manufacturer, Stryker Canada, and the stretchers will be added to vehicles immediately. To ensure there is no disruption to patient care, loaders will be installed during planned vehicle maintenance between now and the end of the year.

Quotes:
“In my 27-year career, I have seen many advancements in the paramedicine field, but I would say that the introduction of power loaders and power stretchers is the single most significant improvement to our practice. This tool has drastically decreased lifting and lowering injuries among paramedics and careers will be extended by many years with this initiative. Just knowing there is a power load system in the ambulance relieves a lot of worries for paramedics.”
     - Shelley Moore, New Glasgow paramedic

“Stryker is pleased to support the people of Nova Scotia and the lifesaving teams who care for them, as together we continue to navigate the complexity and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
     - Lindsay Williams, Vice-President and Managing Director, Stryker Canada

Quick Facts:
-- there are 150 emergency ambulances and 15 patient transfer units in the EHS fleet staffed by 1,150 paramedics and 45 transport operators
-- EHS paramedics respond to about 180,000 calls every year for emergencies and patient transfers
-- the purchase completes the $8.5-million upgrade that began in 2019 and to date 86 ambulances have been outfitted with power stretchers and loaders
-- installation of this equipment was a recommendation to the government in the review of the EHS system by international consultant Fitch and Associates

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forestry contractors looking to move wood or equipment over short distances on provincial roads can apply for special move permits prior to spring weight restrictions taking effect. This is a short-term measure to help keep people in the forestry sector working.

The Department of Public Works will allow some use of provincial roads on a case-by-case basis, based on road and weather conditions. Persisting cold weather overnight may support safe transport.

Applications are being accepted early to ensure that special move permit applications can be assessed prior to spring weight restrictions taking effect on February 27. Contractors are encouraged to complete these applications as soon as possible.

The Department will continue to monitor road and weather conditions to determine how long it can offer special move permits to the forestry sector. 

For inquiries on the permitting process, contact the operations contact centre at 1-844-696-7737.

Quick Facts:
-- decisions will be made based on local road and weather conditions
-- weight restrictions on heavy vehicles are necessary during the spring thaw to protect roads that are weakened by mild and wet weather
-- some roads, including 100-series highways, are exempt from the restrictions
-- this is the third year the Department has accepted applications from the forestry sector, a measure endorsed by the Forestry Transition Team |

"Health and Wellness","New Licence Allows Paramedic Graduates to Work Sooner","HEALTH/WELLNESS--New Licence Allows Paramedic Graduates to Work Sooner
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new temporary licence will mean graduating paramedics can start working in their field sooner, thanks to a new policy approved by the College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia.

Graduates of Medavie HealthEd’s Primary Care Paramedic Program within Nova Scotia and equivalent accredited programs elsewhere in Canada are now eligible for a restricted temporary licence. It allows them to work under the supervision of a paramedic with at least two years of practical experience while they wait to write the Canadian Organization of Paramedic Regulators exam and gain full licensure.

""Paramedics are a critical part of our emergency health system. They are highly skilled and undergo a full 11 to 12 months of training before they graduate,"" said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. ""I am so pleased to see this decision from the College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia that will help get more paramedics on the job faster. This is the kind of change that will help improve access to care for Nova Scotians.”

The Canadian Organization of Paramedic Regulators exam is offered four times each year. Depending on the availability of spaces and graduation timing, some graduates waited months to write the exam and get their licence. The temporary licence means graduates can start working up to six months sooner.

Other professional colleges in Nova Scotia, including those for nurses, physiotherapists and midwives, also use restricted temporary licences to give graduates an opportunity to get on-the-job experience without delays.

Quotes:
“The college’s council and registration committee recognized the importance of identifying this pathway to licensure for the graduate paramedic, which provides an appropriate balance of supporting the healthcare system while serving and protecting the public interest.”
     - Karl Kowalczyk, Executive Director/Registrar, College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia

“The benefit of the new policy is great; it allows us to gain experience faster and keep up with our skills. Other provinces have adopted this type of policy and it seems to work well.”
     - Joseph Loppie, student, Primary Care Paramedic Program, Medavie HealthEd

“We are pleased the college has implemented this policy as it serves as an important measure to enable graduate paramedics an opportunity to apply their training earlier and support the EHS system while preparing to write the national exam.”
     - Mark Walker, Senior Manager, Clinical Services, Emergency Health Services

“We are happy to see this very important and necessary change allowing paramedic graduates to get into the field sooner. We look forward to welcoming these graduates and are hopeful this move will help to alleviate some of the staffing pressures.”
     - Kevin MacMullin, Business Manager, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 727

Quick Facts: 
-- in 2021, 81 Nova Scotians wrote the Canadian Organization of Paramedic Regulators exam

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Province’s Largest Procurement for Renewable Energy Moves Forward","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Province’s Largest Procurement for Renewable Energy Moves Forward
----------------------------------------------------
The Province’s independent procurement administrator, CustomerFirst Renewables, is moving forward with a request for proposals (RFP) today, February 11, for wind and solar energy projects that will supply 10 per cent of the province’s electricity.

These projects will generate 350 megawatts of low-cost renewable energy and reduce Nova Scotia’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than one million tonnes annually.

“This represents the largest potential to reduce greenhouse gases from a single government procurement,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “We are committed to have 80 per cent of Nova Scotia’s electricity needs supplied by renewable energy by 2030, and the projects that come from this RFP will play a critical role in helping us achieve that goal.”

Wind and solar are both low-cost sources of electrical energy in Canada, making this RFP the most economical pathway to reduce a significant amount of greenhouse gases.

The RFP is a competitive, fair and transparent process to provide the best value to ratepayers. It encourages proponents to demonstrate their commitment to engaging with the public – including with Mi’kmaq communities, using the Nova Scotia supply chain and working with underrepresented communities within the energy sector.

Up to five projects are expected to be selected from the process. They are expected to create upwards of 2,000 direct and indirect jobs over their lifetime, mostly in rural Nova Scotia, and generate more than $550 million in construction activity.

Industry experts will review and evaluate the proposals, and successful proponents will receive a 25-year contract with Nova Scotia Power for the sale of the renewable electricity generated. Projects must receive all other required regulatory permits and approvals, including an environmental assessment.

The Province is in the final phase of negotiations with the Canada Infrastructure Bank on financing options for bidders.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotia is already experiencing the impacts of our changing climate. Wind and solar projects are an important part of our energy future as we transition off coal and towards a healthier, cleaner, more sustainable province. This RFP will help us meet our targets in the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act and our commitment to Nova Scotians and our planet.”
     - Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

“In addition to driving economic growth across the Province, the RFP aims to prioritize social benefits by incentivizing meaningful partnerships with the Mi’kmaq of Nova Scotia and other underrepresented groups. The Province is driving significant environmental, economic, and social impact with this RFP, proving that with enough ingenuity and commitment, none need be sacrificed for the other.”
     - Gary Farha, founder and CEO, CustomerFirst Renewables

“The wind and solar industries are uniquely positioned to deliver clean, low-cost, reliable, flexible and scalable solutions to meet Nova Scotia’s energy needs. The launch of this procurement is an important step forward to help Nova Scotia achieve its target of 80 per cent renewable electricity by 2030.”
     - Jean Habel, Director, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, Canadian Renewable Energy Association

“We are eager to collaborate with innovative partners on clean power projects which are essential to reducing Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions. The Province’s renewable energy initiative is a tremendous opportunity to enable both beneficial economic and environmental outcomes in Nova Scotia.”
     - Ehren Cory, CEO, Canada Infrastructure Bank

Quick Facts:
-- the Province appointed CustomerFirst Renewables as the independent procurement administrator in late 2020
-- once these projects are operational, it is expected that 70 per cent of the province’s electricity will be generated by renewable electricity, with the remainder of the 80 per cent target to be reached by 2030
-- the projects also support the Province’s goal of achieving a 53 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and becoming net-zero by 2050

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Dix nouvelles hospitalisations, huit congés, un décès","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Dix nouvelles hospitalisations, huit congés, un décès
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 10 février, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que dix personnes supplémentaires ont été hospitalisées et huit personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également un décès lié à la COVID-19. Une octogénaire est décédée dans le secteur du centre.

« Cette pandémie nous a coûté beaucoup, mais les familles qui ne pourront plus jamais voir ou embrasser leurs proches sont les gens qui ont le plus souffert, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous allons commencer à assouplir les restrictions, mais il faut continuer de faire attention et de prendre les mesures nécessaires pour nous protéger et pour protéger les autres. Continuez de respecter les mesures sanitaires pendant que nous apprenons à vivre avec la COVID-19. »

À l'heure actuelle, 90 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 11 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 0 à 95 ans. L'âge médian est de 65 ans et la durée médiane du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de six jours.

À compter d'aujourd'hui, pour représenter de façon plus exacte les données sur les hospitalisations, les données médianes seront utilisées pour indiquer la durée du séjour à l'hôpital et l'âge des personnes hospitalisées. Auparavant, on utilisait les données moyennes pour indiquer ces données. Puisque certaines personnes sont hospitalisées pendant une période prolongée, dans certains cas en attendant d'être transférées à un autre établissement, les données médianes sont plus exactes. 

Parmi les 90 personnes hospitalisées, 87 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

« Il n'est jamais facile d'apprendre que nous avons perdu une autre personne en raison de ce virus. Je pense aux familles et aux proches dans le deuil et je prie pour eux, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous faisons notre possible pour protéger les gens depuis deux ans, et c'est pourquoi nous avons des restrictions et des règlements qui sont frustrants, mais nécessaires. Je suis optimiste et je vois que la situation s'améliore grâce au travail des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse, et je sais que nous pouvons commencer à assouplir les restrictions avec confiance. »  

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 24 (26,7 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 34 (37,8 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 0 (0 %) n'ont reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 32 (35,6 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que moins de 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Il y a également deux autres groupes de personnes à l'hôpital à cause de la COVID-19 :
-- 129 personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à leur arrivée à l'hôpital mais ont été admises pour une autre raison de santé, ou elles ont été admises à cause de la COVID-19 mais n'ont plus besoin de soins spécialisés;
-- 143 personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 après avoir été admises à l'hôpital.

Vaccination

Au 9 février, 2 169 722 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. En Nouvelle-Écosse, 91,5 % des gens ont reçu leur première dose et 85,2 % ont reçu leur deuxième dose.

En outre, 59,2 % des gens de 18 ans et plus ont reçu une dose de rappel et 2,4 % ont pris rendez-vous pour recevoir leur dose de rappel.

Cas et dépistage

Le 9 février, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 931 tests. On signale 365 cas supplémentaires de COVID-19 confirmés en laboratoire.

Il y a 143 cas dans le secteur du centre, 64 dans le secteur de l'est, 49 dans le secteur du nord et 109 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'il y a 3 306 cas actifs de COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Éclosions dans les établissements de soins de longue durée

La Régie signale une nouvelle éclosion au Centre de santé régional de Cumberland à Amherst. Moins de cinq patients ont contracté la COVID-19. 

La Régie signale également des cas supplémentaires liés aux éclosions dans deux hôpitaux : 
-- Six patients supplémentaires dans une unité à l'hôpital général de Digby; un total de 14 patients ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19.
-- Deux patients supplémentaires dans une unité à l'hôpital Aberdeen à New Glasgow; un total de 10 patients ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19.

La Province signale deux éclosions dans des établissements de soins de longue durée :
-- Trois résidents et un employé de Townsview Estates à Truro
-- Quatre résidents et cinq membres du personnel de Bay Side Home à Barrington

La Santé publique collabore avec les établissements pour freiner la transmission. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a été prolongé jusqu'au 20 février 2022.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","10 New Hospital Admissions, Eight Discharges, One Death","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--10 New Hospital Admissions, Eight Discharges, One Death
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, February 10, Nova Scotia is reporting 10 new hospital admissions and eight discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting one death related to COVID-19. A woman in her 80s in Central Zone has died.

“This pandemic has taken so much, but the families who will never see or hug their loved one again have suffered the most,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We’re starting to ease restrictions, but we still need to be cautious and take steps to protect ourselves and others. Please continue to follow the public health measures as we work towards living with COVID-19.”

There are 90 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 11 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 0-95 years old. The median age is 65, and the median length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is six days.

Starting today, to more accurately represent hospitalization data, the releases will use medians to report two figures: the length of stay and age of those in hospital. Previously, the mean, or average, was used to report this data. However, because some people are in hospital for a long stay, in some cases waiting to be discharged to another facility, using median is more accurate. 

Of the 90 people in hospital, 87 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

“It’s never easy to hear we lost another Nova Scotian to this virus. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones grieving,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Trying to protect people is what we’ve been doing for two years and why we’ve had restrictions and rules that are frustrating but necessary. I am optimistic that things are improving and because of the hard work of Nova Scotians, I am confident about starting to loosen restrictions.”  

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 24 (26.7 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 34 (37.8 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 0 (0 per cent) are partially vaccinated
-- 32 (35.6 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 129 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 143 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of February 9, 2,169,722 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 91.5 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 85.2 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 59.2 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 2.4 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

On February 9, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 2,931 tests. An additional 365 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 143 cases in Central Zone, 64 cases in Eastern Zone, 49 cases in Northern Zone and 109 cases in Western Zone.

As of today, there are an estimated 3,306 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Long-Term Care Outbreaks:

NSHA is reporting a new outbreak at Cumberland Regional Health Centre in Amherst. Fewer than five patients have tested positive. 
NSHA is also reporting additional cases related to the outbreaks in two hospitals: 
-- six additional patients in a ward at Digby General Hospital; a total of 14 patients have now tested positive
-- two additional patients in a ward at Aberdeen Hospital in New Glasgow; a total of 10 patients have now tested positive.

The Province is reporting two outbreaks in long-term care facilities:
-- three residents and one staff member have tested positive at Townsview Estates in Truro
-- four residents and five staff members have tested positive at Bay Side Home in Barrington.

Public health is working with the facilities to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to February 20, 2022

"Premier's Office / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Province Accepts Minimum Wage Recommendations","PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Province Accepts Minimum Wage Recommendations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Province has accepted all remaining recommendations from the Nova Scotia Minimum Wage Review Committee, which include a path to a $15 minimum wage by 2024.

“We are committed to ensuring our province grows and that all Nova Scotians benefit from that growth,” said Premier Tim Houston. “After further consultation with stakeholders, we are accepting the full set of recommendations put forward by the Minimum Wage Review Committee. I want to thank the committee for their work, along with hard-working Nova Scotians for the essential services they provide every day.”

In January, the Province accepted the committee’s recommendation to increase the minimum wage by 40 cents to $13.35 an hour on April 1.

To reach $15, the minimum wage will increase to the following amounts over the next two years:
-- April 1 – $13.35 
-- October 1 – $13.60 
-- April 1, 2023 – $14.30 
-- October 1, 2023 – $14.65 
-- April 1, 2024 – $15.

The committee also recommended the minimum wage increase annually based on the national consumer price index, plus an additional one per cent, effective April 1, 2025.

“Working Nova Scotians deserve to be paid a fair wage. I also recognize many businesses have had a difficult time during the pandemic. That’s why it’s so important to take a balanced approach that supports both employees and employers,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “These increases will help minimum wage earners and their families, as well as provide businesses with an outlook, so they can plan ahead.”

Quick Facts: 
-- the Minimum Wage Review Committee consists of employee and employer representatives
-- under the Labour Standards Code, the committee is mandated to conduct an annual review of the minimum wage in Nova Scotia
-- an average of 8.1 per cent of workers, or 31,400 Nova Scotians, worked for minimum wage during the period from April 2020 to March 2021; they worked primarily in retail trade, followed by food and accommodation industries

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness","Speak Up For Healthcare Tour Report Released","PREMIER’S OFFICE/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Speak Up For Healthcare Tour Report Released
----------------------------------------------------------------
Frontline healthcare workers gave Premier Tim Houston and provincial health leaders hundreds of ideas to consider as they move to fix healthcare in the province. 

Ideas received on last fall’s Speak Up for Healthcare Tour consultation fall into three main themes: access to care, recruitment and retention and physical and digital healthcare infrastructure. A summary of what was heard during the tour can be found at: https://novascotia.ca/docs/speak-up-for-Healthcare-what-we-heard-report.pdf  

“The system has been under pressure for a long time and the Omicron wave of COVID-19 is making things even more difficult for our healthcare professionals,” said Premier Houston. “I was struck by the passion and dedication of our frontline workers. I want to thank them for having the courage, and taking the time, to share their feedback. We’ve heard you, we understand, and we are acting.”

Hundreds of frontline healthcare workers from Nova Scotia Health, the IWK and Emergency Health Services, in addition to stakeholder organizations, professional associations and unions, participated in the tour and provided feedback. Site visits and roundtable discussions were held at the IWK Health Centre and at Nova Scotia Health sites in each of the four health zones. There were also follow-up virtual meetings with various stakeholder groups.

The government has already taken action to improve healthcare as it works on a multi-year plan. Steps taken so far include:
-- establishing the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment, the Office of Addictions and Mental Health and the Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care
-- replacing the Nova Scotia Health Authority board of directors with an interim administrator and introducing a streamlined leadership team to work with frontline healthcare workers and system leaders to drive change
-- offering jobs to all graduating nurses in Nova Scotia and developing a nursing mentorship program
-- opening urgent treatment centres in North Sydney and Parrsboro
-- adding new vehicles and staff to double patient transfers and enable paramedics to focus on emergencies
-- expanding virtual care to everyone on the Need a Family Practice registry
-- investing $57 million to attract and retain more people to work in continuing care and to open beds more quickly to seniors
-- launching a recruitment campaign to attract healthcare professionals and creating a team of navigators to connect healthcare professionals with the information they need to support their move to Nova Scotia
-- completing extensive work at Dartmouth General Hospital under the QEII New Generation Project
-- opening a new recovery support centre in Dartmouth to help people struggling with substance use and gambling addictions.

Healthcare workers and all Nova Scotians will see a multi-year plan to fix healthcare before the end of March.

Quotes:
“We need a patient-focused, high-quality health system that will deliver care by the right person at the right time at the right place. The tour provided lots of food for thought from frontline staff, and I want to thank them for their dedication and courage to bring these ideas forward. We will use this information to help with decisions and our planning to improve the health system. We’ve already started making changes and frontline workers and Nova Scotians will see a multi-year plan to fix healthcare by the end of March.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness and Minister responsible for the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

“As a physician and program leader, it is clear to me that the voices of our frontline colleagues are essential to creating a better healthcare system. The wealth of clinical experience in our workforce is a tremendous resource and will help us provide better care to Nova Scotians.”
     - Dr. Andrew Harris, Senior Medical Director, Mental Health and Addictions Program, Nova Scotia Health

“Being able to take part in the process was so important. The work that we do here in the Women’s Ambulatory Program at the IWK is crucial to the health and quality of life of the population that we serve. Historically, reproductive health has not received the attention or funding it needs, so being provided a venue where all members of the healthcare team were invited to share their vision to improve access and quality of care in this province was exciting.”
     - Leah Pink, nurse practitioner, Women’s Ambulatory Clinic, Women’s & Newborn Health Program, IWK Health

“It is no secret that the system is stretched thin right now, a strain that is being felt by myself and my colleagues across the province. As such, I appreciated the opportunity to meet directly with decision-makers and provide feedback on ways to improve the emergency medical system. I am hopeful those concerns and ideas were heard, which will turn into lasting and meaningful change.”
     - Adam Hussey, paramedic, Sydney

Quick Facts:
-- the Speak Up for Healthcare tour included Premier Houston; Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson; Health and Wellness Deputy Minister Jeannine Lagasse; Nova Scotia Health Authority administrator Janet Davidson; Nova Scotia Health Authority CEO Karen Oldfield; and Kevin Orrell, Deputy Minister and CEO of the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

« Bien que nous devions continuer de faire preuve de prudence, nous sommes sur la bonne voie et nous pouvons commencer à assouplir les restrictions de façon graduelle, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous demandons à tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de continuer de respecter les mesures sanitaires pendant les trois phases pour que nous puissions arriver à nous adapter à la vie avec la COVID-19. »

Au cours de la première phase, les activités seront permises, le nombre de personnes pouvant se rassembler augmentera et les restrictions imposées à l'entrée des voyageurs internes dans la province seront levées. Au cours de la deuxième phase, le nombre de personnes pouvant se rassembler augmentera davantage. Au cours de la troisième phase, les limites sur les rassemblements et les exigences en matière d'éloignement physique seront éliminées.

Pendant les deux premières phases, le port du masque sera toujours requis dans les lieux intérieurs publics, et la preuve de vaccination complète sera toujours requise pour participer à des activités facultatives. Ces restrictions pourraient également être maintenues dans la troisième phase, selon l'épidémiologie.

On prévoit que chaque phase durera environ un mois. La décision de passer à la prochaine phase dépendra de l'épidémiologie, du nombre d'hospitalisations, du nombre de cas dans les établissements de soins de longue durée et du nombre d'employés absents.

« Comme toujours, nous visons à trouver l'équilibre entre les mesures qui contribuent à limiter la propagation du virus et le fonctionnement de notre société et de notre économie, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Avec l'assouplissement des restrictions, nous surveillerons la situation de près et nous ajusterons nos plans au besoin. »

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Public Health Restrictions to Ease Over Three Phases","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Public Health Restrictions to Ease Over Three Phases
--------------------------------------------------------
Provincewide COVID-19 restrictions will be eased over three phases, starting Monday, February 14.

“While we still need to be cautious, things are moving in the right direction and we can start to slowly ease restrictions,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We ask Nova Scotians to continue following the public health measures as we work through these phases together and move toward a state of living with COVID-19.”

In Phase 1, events will be allowed again, gathering limits will increase and all border restrictions for domestic travellers will be lifted. In Phase 2, gathering limits will be further increased. In Phase 3, there will be no more gathering limits or physical distance requirements.

Throughout the first two phases, masks will continue to be required in indoor public places and proof of full vaccination will continue to be required for discretionary activities. These restrictions may also continue in Phase 3, depending on epidemiology.

Each phase is expected to last about a month. Moving to the next phase will depend on epidemiology, hospitalizations, case activity in long-term care facilities and employee absenteeism.

“As always, we aim to strike the balance between measures that help limit the spread of the virus and allowing our society and economy to function,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “As we ease restrictions, we’ll monitor closely and make adjustments to our plans if necessary.”

Details of the restrictions in each phase are at: https://novascotia.ca/reopening-plan/

Phase 1 will start at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Some of the key changes in this phase are:

"Premier's Office","Better Wages for Continuing Care Assistants","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Better Wages for Continuing Care Assistants
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing approximately $65 million in health authorities, long-term care and home care to increase pay for continuing care assistants (CCAs) so they will become the highest paid in Atlantic Canada.

Wages for unionized and non-unionized CCAs at all levels in the publicly funded sector will increase by approximately 23 per cent effective Thursday, February 10, bringing the top annual salary to $48,419. For most full-time CCAs, this is an annual increase of close to $9,000 a year. Those currently at the top of their pay scale will reach this level immediately.  

The continuing care sector is facing serious recruitment and retention issues with many CCAs working short-staffed under difficult conditions. This is impacting the quality and availability of care for seniors and their families.

“We’re doing everything we can to fix the system, and we’ve heard from CCAs and unions time and again that we can’t do this until we address wages for CCAs, which I was shocked to hear were the lowest in the country,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We feel the urgency and the frustration. The system needs investment, and the workers need support now. We want them to know they are heard, valued and respected.” 

Those groups with collective agreements that are already settled will be adjusted upward to the new levels and those not yet settled will incorporate the new pay scales. Collective bargaining will continue, and CCAs will not have to wait until bargaining concludes to receive this increase. Details and timing of implementation will be determined by individual employers working with unions.

Quotes:
""Continuing care assistants deserve not only our respect and gratitude for the critically important work they do and the sacrifices they’ve made over the past two years; they also deserve to be paid more and get help and relief from more staff in their workplaces. We’re listening to their concerns, and we’re making investments to improve working conditions, hire more staff, and give them a much-needed raise in pay.”
     - Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care 

Quick Facts:
-- there are 6,700 publicly funded CCA positions in Nova Scotia, most in continuing care 
-- most CCAs have expired collective agreements (October 31, 2020) with an expired annual salary range between $36,529 and $39,443; the new salary range will be between $44,660 and $48,419  
-- the government has committed to hiring 1,400 additional CCAs 
-- the wage increase brings Nova Scotia to about $25 per hour at the top of the scale for CCAs in the publicly funded system
-- the government is investing close to $57 million to support people working in continuing care, hire more staff, and open more beds more quickly for seniors waiting for long-term care

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Nouvelles recommandations sur les doses de rappel pour les adolescents","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE-- Nouvelles recommandations sur les doses de rappel pour les adolescents
---------------------------------------------------------
La Province recommande que les jeunes néo-écossais de 12 à 17 ans à risque plus élevé de maladie grave reçoivent une dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

En fonction d'une recommandation récente du Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation (CCNI), une dose de rappel est maintenant offerte aux jeunes de 12 à 17 ans qui :
-- ont une affection sous-jacente qui pourrait entraîner un risque plus élevé de maladie grave en raison de la COVID-19, y compris les personnes immunodéficientes et les personnes qui ont déjà reçu une série primaire de trois doses (pour les jeunes immunodéficients, la dose de rappel serait une quatrième dose); 
-- vivent dans des lieux de vie collectifs, y compris des refuges, des foyers de groupe, des logements pour travailleurs migrants et des établissements correctionnels;
-- font partie de communautés racisées ou marginalisées touchées de manière disproportionnée par la COVID-19.

« La majorité des adolescents de 12 à 17 ans en Nouvelle-Écosse n'ont pas besoin d'une dose de rappel puisqu'ils ne sont pas à risque de maladie grave en raison de la COVID-19 s'ils sont entièrement vaccinés, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef. Toutefois, pour certains, l'avantage de recevoir d'une dose de rappel plus rapidement que prévu l'emporte sur le risque de contracter la COVID-19. »

L'utilisation des doses de rappel pour ce groupe d'âge est actuellement hors indication puisque que Santé Canada, l'organisme fédéral de réglementation, n'a pas encore approuvé le vaccin pour un tel usage pour ce groupe d'âge. Toutefois, le CCNI souligne que des études préliminaires démontrent que l'administration de doses de rappel chez les adolescents dans d'autres régions du monde n'a entraîné aucun problème de sûreté différent des problèmes liés à l'administration des vaccins de la série principale. Le CCNI ajoute que le vaccin de Pfizer est le produit préféré pour la dose de rappel pour ce groupe d'âge. 

Les enfants de 12 à 17 ans qui ne font pas partie des groupes ci-dessus sont également admissibles à recevoir la dose de rappel, avec leur consentement éclairé. Les familles doivent lire les renseignements fournis dans le cadre du processus de prise de rendez-vous au sujet des doses de rappel pour ce groupe d'âge, y compris le risque rare de myocardite et de péricardite après l'administration d'une dose d'un vaccin contre la COVID-19 à base d'ARNm.

Le CCNI a aussi récemment publié une recommandation au sujet des troisièmes doses pour les enfants de 5 à 11 ans qui sont atteints d'une déficience immunitaire moyenne ou grave au moment de recevoir leur première ou leur deuxième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19. Ils sont maintenant admissibles à recevoir une troisième dose du vaccin pour terminer leur série primaire. Une troisième dose peut être reçue 56 jours après la deuxième dose.

De plus, le CCNI offre de nouvelles recommandations aux personnes qui ont contracté la COVID-19 :
-- les personnes qui ont contracté la COVID-19 et qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées devraient attendre au moins deux mois pour obtenir la première ou la deuxième dose du vaccin;
-- les personnes qui ont contracté la COVID-19 et qui sont entièrement vaccinées devraient attendre au moins trois mois pour obtenir leur dose de rappel, à condition d'être entièrement vaccinées depuis au moins 168 et d'être admissibles à une dose de rappel.

La Province appuie les dernières recommandations du CCNI.

Citation
« Les experts en maladies infectieuses du IWK et moi-même appuyons les recommandations de la Santé publique de la Nouvelle-Écosse et du Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation visant à offrir la dose de rappel en priorité aux jeunes de 12 à 17 ans qui présentent des facteurs de risque. Comparativement aux adultes plus âgés, les adolescents ont généralement une maladie plus bénigne lorsqu'ils contractent la COVID-19. Toutefois, comparativement à leurs pairs, les adolescents qui présentent des facteurs de risque tels que l'obésité, l'asthme (condition moyenne ou grave), le cancer, la fibrose kystique, le diabète, une maladie cardiaque ou pulmonaire grave, certaines maladies du sang, le syndrome de Down, l'épilepsie ou un système immunitaire affaibli. N'hésitez pas à discuter de vos inquiétudes avec votre médecin de famille ou votre spécialiste pédiatrique. »

Faits en bref
-- La dose de rappel est administrée 168 jours après la série primaire de deux doses.
-- La série primaire des personnes ayant une immunodéficience moyenne à grave est de trois doses, la dose de rappel étant la quatrième dose.
-- Environ 98 % des jeunes de 12 à 17 ans ont reçu deux doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ou ont pris rendez-vous pour recevoir leur deuxième dose.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","New Guidance on COVID-19 Boosters for Adolescents, Third Doses for Children, Vaccine for People who Test Positive","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--New Guidance on COVID-19 Boosters for Adolescents, Third Doses for Children, Vaccine for People who Test Positive
----------------------------------------------------
The Province is recommending a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine for Nova Scotians ages 12 to 17 at higher risk of severe illness. 

The age of booster eligibility has lowered following a recent recommendation by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) for young people 12 to17 years old who:
-- have an underlying medical condition that may put them at high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19, including those who are immunocompromised and who have already received a three-dose primary series (for adolescents who are immunocompromised, a booster dose would be their fourth dose) 
-- are residents of congregate living settings, including shelters, group homes, quarters for migrant workers and correctional facilities
-- belong to racialized or marginalized communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

“The majority of adolescents 12 to 17 in Nova Scotia do not need a booster dose as they are at low risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes if they are fully vaccinated,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “However, for some, the benefit of receiving a booster dose ahead of further approvals outweighs the risk of getting COVID-19.”

Booster doses in this age group are currently considered off-label because Health Canada, the federal regulator, has not yet approved the vaccine for this use in this age group. However, NACI says preliminary findings from booster doses in adolescents in other parts of the world show no different safety concerns than those from the primary series of vaccine. NACI also says the Pfizer booster dose is preferred for this age group. 

Families with children 12 to 17 who do not fall into the groups above are also eligible for a booster with informed consent. They will need to review the information provided during the booking process about booster doses in this age group, including the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following a dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Evidence shows adolescents remain well protected against severe COVID-19 and hospitalization with two doses of vaccine.

NACI recently also issued a strong recommendation on third doses for children ages 5 to 11 who are moderately to severely immunocompromised at the time of their first or second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. They are now eligible for a third dose of vaccine to complete their primary series. A third dose can be booked 56 days after the second dose.

And, NACI has new advice on vaccine timing for people who have tested positive for COVID-19:
-- people who tested positive and have not been fully vaccinated are advised to wait at least two months to get a first or second dose of vaccine
-- people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have been fully vaccinated are advised to wait at least three months to get a booster dose, provided they have been fully vaccinated for at least 168 days and are eligible for a booster.

The Province supports NACI’s most recent guidance.

Quotes:
“My IWK infectious disease experts and I support the NS Public Health and National Advisory Committee on Immunizations recommendation to prioritize COVID booster vaccinations for our 12 to 17-year-olds with risk factors. When compared to older adults, adolescents tend to have milder COVID disease. However, when compared to their peers, adolescents with risk factors for more serious COVID infections include those with obesity, moderate to severe asthma, cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, serious heart and lung conditions, some blood disorders, Down Syndrome, epilepsy and weakened immune systems. Please discuss any concerns you may have with your family physician or pediatric specialist.”
     - Dr. Andrew Lynk, Chief, Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre; Chair, Pediatrics, Dalhousie University

Quick Facts:
-- booster doses are administered 168 days after a two-dose primary series
-- the primary series for people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised is three doses; a booster would be their fourth dose
-- about 98 per cent of people 12 to 17 years old have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine or have a second dose appointment scheduled

"Community Services / Municipal Affairs and Housing","More Supportive Housing in Halifax","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING/COMMUNITY SERVICES--More Supportive Housing in Halifax 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Seven African Nova Scotian men will soon have a place to live in a new supportive housing facility in Halifax.

The North End Community Health Centre has bought a house in central Halifax with help from a grant from the Province worth nearly $700,000.

“This is a wonderful opportunity to give these men both a home and the help they need to succeed,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. 

Six residents will be chosen from the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia’s By-Name List. A peer support counsellor will also live in the home, and residents will have wrap-around harm-reduction supports available.

“Many people experiencing chronic homelessness find it difficult to maintain housing without additional supports,” said Community Services Minister Karla MacFarlane. “This investment will help ensure even more people experiencing homelessness have accessible, wraparound supports to help them live safe, meaningful lives within their community.”

Residents will move in by the end of February. 

Quotes:
“We are excited to be acquiring new housing units that continue to prioritize people from the African Nova Scotian community, or who identify as being of African descent. We will continue to work with the community, our partners and our clients to ensure that the supports offered to tenants meet their needs. We will continue to enhance our peer support model with the hope that tenants can create a shared sense of home. We strive to create supportive housing from which well-being and healing can emerge.” 
     - Marie-France LeBlanc, Executive Director, North End Community Health Centre

Quick Facts:
-- as of Feb. 7, there were 492 people in HRM experiencing homelessness, according to the By-Name List maintained by the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia
-- the Province has committed more than $35 million to create over 1,100 new affordable housing units across the province

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is moving quickly to train more students for high-demand healthcare jobs across Nova Scotia.

The Departments of Advanced Education and Health and Wellness, along with Nova Scotia Health, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Toronto-based Michener Institute of Education at University Health Network. The Michener Institute specializes in applied health sciences education and provides training opportunities for critical positions within the healthcare system. The MOU establishes a relationship with the institute to explore innovative opportunities to increase training capacity for positions that are in demand in the Nova Scotia healthcare system.

“We’ve made a promise to all Nova Scotians to improve healthcare,” said Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education. “To fulfill that promise and to address urgent needs, we know we need more students training in critical healthcare jobs where there are labour gaps and where we currently lack capacity to train them as quickly as we’d like to in Nova Scotia. The Michener Institute is a world-renowned training provider that has an impressive track record. I am proud of this partnership and the opportunities it could create for our students here at home.”

With the MOU in place, work will begin immediately to identify priority program areas, training delivery and funding. The Province will share details when finalized.

Quotes:
“The healthcare system has a great need for well-trained and dedicated people. With this MOU with the Michener Institute, the government continues to build on its efforts to date, such as hiring all graduating nurses and creating the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment, to improve the labour situation in healthcare.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“We are keen to partner with the Michener Institute to provide Nova Scotia students with another option for accessing specialized training to become healthcare professionals who want to live and work in Nova Scotia. This partnership will ensure we are able to support training for highly competitive positions by providing hands-on learning opportunities in our facilities. Hands-on training is invaluable to the student experience and increases the likelihood of students staying in Nova Scotia.”
     - Karen Oldfield, President and CEO, Nova Scotia Health

“For more than 60 years, the Michener Institute of Education at UHN has been graduating much-needed health professionals to work in complex areas of health care and support excellent patient care. We look forward to partnering with Nova Scotia as we continue to fulfill our commitments and obligations to Ontario.”
     - Harvey P. Weingarten, Principal, Michener Institute of Education, University Health Network

Quick Facts:
-- the Michener Institute is the only Canadian post-secondary institute that specializes exclusively in applied health sciences education
-- the institute is part of the University Health Network, which includes several academic and research hospitals in Ontario, including Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital and the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians living with disabilities will have more options as they move into a community to pursue their interests, develop life skills, access employment and connect with friends and neighbours.

My Days is a new initiative that will provide opportunities for people to choose how they want to spend their time as part of community living. Forty residents moving to homes in the community as part of the closure of Harbourside Lodge, an adult residential centre in Yarmouth, will be the first to take part in My Days.

“It is important for Nova Scotians who are leaving large institutions to have access to activities they enjoy or want to try,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “This will create opportunities to work, volunteer and be active in their community while helping our communities be stronger, more diverse and inclusive.”

The Disability Support Program is working with service providers and community agencies across the province to expand the list of activities available to participants, starting with people moving to community-based settings. Individuals who currently use day programs will continue to do so. In the future, they will also have access to expanded opportunities available through My Days.

Quotes:
“My day starts when I wake up in the morning and ends when I go to bed at night. It is not 9 to 3, Monday to Friday.”
     - Member of Disability Support Program Advisory Committee 

“I'm very excited about the opportunities this new approach will give Prescott Group and others like us to expand our services and meet the needs of people with disabilities in the ways that they choose. This is going to be a great addition to the landscape of our community.”
     - Alice Evans, Executive Director, Prescott Group

Quick Facts:
-- My Days is funded from previously approved funding to continue moving more residents out of adult residential centres and regional rehabilitation centres
-- My Days funding will include individualized supports for participants and will assist community groups to offer new activities, including employment, volunteering, and recreation, that respond to how people choose to spend their time
-- My Days is being developed in consultation with participants, families, advocates and day program providers
-- the Disability Support Program serves about 5,400 children, youth and adults with intellectual disabilities, long-term mental illness and physical disabilities in a range of community-based, residential and vocational day programs

"Justice / Office of Addictions and Mental Health","Public Safety Personnel Online Therapy Program Launches","JUSTICE/ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--Public Safety Personnel Online Therapy Program Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A new program aimed at improving the mental health of Nova Scotia’s first responders and other public safety personnel launched today, February 8. 

PSPNET, a free, confidential program is designed for paramedics, police, firefighters, correctional workers, search and rescue, 911 operators, border services officers and others in the public safety field. Developed by a team of clinicians and researchers at the University of Regina, the online cognitive behaviour therapy modules address anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.

“Police, paramedics, sheriffs, correctional officers and many other emergency workers see things every day that can be very traumatic,” said Justice Minister Brad Johns. “We owe it to them to make sure supports are there to help them cope with mental health challenges they face because of the nature of their jobs.”

The two-year pilot program is a partnership between Department of Justice’s Public Safety Division, the Office of Addictions and Mental Health, the Canadian Institute for Public Safety Research and Treatment, and Medavie.

The program includes a combination of secure email and phone calls, and runs eight to 16 weeks depending on need of the individual. 

The program is now available in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan.

Quotes:
“The nature of work done by first responders makes them especially vulnerable to experiencing mental health challenges. It is important that they have access to tailored supports and therapies that help promote positive mental health and address the specific mental health challenges they might face.” 
     - Brian Comer, Minister Responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health

Quick Facts:
-- $775,000 is being invested in the program by Public Safety Canada, Medavie, through the Medavie Health Foundation, Nova Scotia Office of Addictions and Mental Health and the Department of Justice, Prince Edward Island Department of Justice and Public Safety, and New Brunswick Department of Health  
-- PSPNET is designed to provide free and confidential access for first responders and other public safety personnel who self-report problems with anxiety, depression, or other posttraumatic stress injuries, are 18 years of age or older, are comfortable using and have access to the internet, are willing to provide a local medical contact in case of emergencies and live in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, or Saskatchewan

"Environment and Climate Change","Update on Northern Pulp Environmental Assessment Process","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Update on Northern Pulp Environmental Assessment Process 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The public consultation period on the draft terms of reference which Northern Pulp must use to prepare its Class II environmental assessment report closed on January 31. About 1,300 submissions were received by the Province. 

A proposed Northern Pulp mill revitalization and new pulp effluent treatment facility project in Pictou County was registered for a Class II environmental assessment on December 7, 2021.

The submissions were sent to Northern Pulp Monday, February 7, and the company now has up to 21 days to respond to them. After the Department receives Northern Pulp’s response, it has 14 days to prepare the final terms of reference for the company to prepare its environmental assessment report. The Department will make the submissions public at that time as well. 

After receiving the final terms of reference, the company has up to two years to submit its environmental assessment report for the proposed mill transformation and effluent treatment facility project. Once the company’s report is received, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change will refer it to an independent, appointed environmental assessment panel to oversee public consultation and evaluation of the company’s report.

The Province’s Environment Act and its regulations set out the legal framework for provincial environmental assessments of proposed major projects in Nova Scotia. Every proposal is subject to the same requirements, processes and timelines.

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia’s environmental assessment process is science- and evidence-based; companies are required to identify the environmental risks of their work and provide a plan to mitigate them
-- the Department’s role as the regulator is to ensure companies accurately determine potential environmental impacts and plans to mitigate them
-- the environmental assessment process focuses primarily on the planning and design phase of a project, not the construction phase; companies cannot construct or operate until they receive an environmental assessment approval 
-- if, and when, an environmental assessment is approved, companies then go through a second process, the industrial approval phase where emission targets – based on the environmental risks and mitigations identified during the environmental assessment process – are set 
-- a Class II environmental assessment typically takes 275 calendar days to complete, not including the time it takes the company to prepare an environmental assessment report

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 7 février, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que 10 autres personnes ont été hospitalisées et que 6 personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également trois décès liés à la COVID-19 : -- une femme dans la soixantaine dans le secteur du centre, 
-- une septuagénaire dans le secteur de l'ouest
-- une septuagénaire dans le secteur du nord.

« Il est extrêmement triste d’apprendre que nous avons encore perdu trois autres personnes en fin de semaine à cause de la COVID-19. Il n’y a rien que nous puissions dire pour réconforter les familles et les amis dans le deuil, a confié le premier ministre Tim Houston. Ce virus continue d’avoir des conséquences désastreuses pour certains. De grâce, faites-vous vacciner et suivez les mesures de santé publique pour vous protéger et pour protéger les personnes autour de vous. » 

À l’heure actuelle, 91 personnes sont hospitalisées en raison de la COVID-19 et elles reçoivent les soins nécessaires dans des unités spécialisées. De ce nombre, 12 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 4 à 97 ans et l’âge moyen est de 65 ans. La durée moyenne du séjour à l’hôpital pour les personnes atteintes de la COVID-19 est de 7,9 jours.

« Aujourd'hui, mes pensées et mes prières accompagnent les proches de trois autres personnes qui ont perdu la vie en raison de cette maladie, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. En nous faisant vacciner, nous nous protégeons et nous protégeons nos proches. À mesure que nous nous rapprochons de l’assouplissement des restrictions, nous devons travailler ensemble, nous faire vacciner – qu’il s’agisse de la première ou de la deuxième dose ou de la dose de rappel – et suivre les consignes de la Santé publique. » 

Parmi les 91 personnes hospitalisées, 84 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 24 (26,4 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;

“It’s extremely sad to hear we lost three more Nova Scotians this weekend from COVID-19. There is nothing anyone can say to comfort the families and friends who are grieving,” said Premier Tim Houston. “This virus continues to have devastating impacts for some. Please get vaccinated and follow the public health measures to protect yourself and those around you.”

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","La Province ajoute 500 lits au système de soins de longue durée, les travaux se poursuivent sur 27 établissements","AÎNÉS ET SOINS DE LONGUE DURÉE--La Province ajoute 500 lits au système de soins de longue durée, les travaux se poursuivent sur 27 établissements 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : La liste des 27 établissements de soins de longue durée en construction ou en rénovation est présentée à la fin du communiqué.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
La Province ajoute 500 lits au système des soins de longue durée et remplira son engagement visant à construire ou à rénover des établissements à l'échelle de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Les 500 nouveaux lits s'ajoutent aux projets déjà en cours visant à ajouter ou à améliorer 2 000 lits dans 27 établissements. Une fois terminés, ces projets auront permis l'ajout ou l'amélioration de plus de 2 800  lits à l'échelle de la province, surpassant l'objectif du gouvernement d'ajouter 2 500 lits sur une période de trois ans.

« Nos aînés méritent d'être traités avec respect et dignité, et d'avoir les mesures de soutien appropriées en place pendant leur vieillissement, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Ces investissements permettront aux personnes âgées de la province d'avoir accès à des établissements modernes et à une main-d'oeuvre qualifiée pour leur offrir des soins. »

Les 500 nouveaux lits seront ajoutés dans de nouveaux établissements dans la Municipalité régionale d'Halifax. Un appel de fournisseurs qualifiés a été publié aujourd'hui 7 février afin de déterminer qui sera admissible à bâtir les établissements.

Les 27 projets de soins de longue durée préapprouvés sont à différentes étapes de la construction ou de la rénovation, et les premiers nouveaux établissements ouvriront leurs portes en 2023.

« Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse doivent attendre beaucoup trop longtemps pour obtenir une place dans un établissement de soins de longue durée, et une partie de la solution consiste à créer plus de chambres à un lit et à embaucher le personnel approprié, souligne Barbara Adams, ministre des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée. Près de 2 000 personnes ont besoin de soins de longue durée, et des centaines d'entre elles sont hospitalisées en attendant leur place dans un établissement. Il faut faire en sorte que les gens aient accès aux soins nécessaires, et que les lits dans les hôpitaux soient libérés pour ceux qui en ont besoin. Cet investissement est d'autant plus urgent puisque nous avons l'une des populations les plus âgées au Canada. »

L'investissement dans les établissements de soins de longue durée est une autre étape du plan de la Province visant à offrir du soutien supplémentaire au secteur des soins continus. Les projets ont un impact économique de plusieurs milliards de dollars à l'échelle de la province. Ces investissements créent également des milliers d'emplois en ingénierie, en construction et en soins de santé.

« Les investissements dans l'infrastructure et les ressources connexes annoncés aujourd'hui sont très positifs pour les personnes qui vivent et qui travaillent dans des établissements de soins de longue durée.  La construction ou la rénovation des installations afin de répondre aux normes actuelles, y compris l'ajout de chambres individuelles, permettront des soins améliorés et sûrs et une meilleure qualité de vie pour les résidents.
     - Mary Lee, présidente et directrice générale, Health Association Nova Scotia

« Nous sommes ravis d'être inclus dans cet incroyable investissement dans les soins de longue durée. La planification pour la construction d'un établissement à la fine pointe de la technologie à Fall River est en cours. Le nouvel établissement accueillera 144 personnes et fera partie d'un campus qui aidera les aînés et la communauté à mieux vivre. L'établissement Shoreham Village de Chester sera aussi entièrement transformé. En plus de l'investissement visant à améliorer l'espace de vie pour les 89 résidents actuels, le nouvel établissement offrira un total de 96 lits pour mieux servir la communauté. »
     - Janet Simm, présidente et directrice générale, Northwood

-- Environ 7 500 personnes vivent dans un établissement de soins de longue durée en Nouvelle-Écosse.
-- Plus de 21 % de la population néo-écossaise est âgée de plus de 65 ans, ce qui représente le troisième pourcentage le plus élevé au Canada.

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Province Adding 500 More New Long-Term Care Beds, Work Continues on 27 Facilities","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Province Adding 500 More New Long-Term Care Beds, Work Continues on 27 Facilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A list of the 27 long-term care facilities currently in development is at the end of this news release.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province will add 500 new beds in the long-term care system and is following through on commitments to build or renovate facilities across Nova Scotia.

The 500 beds are in addition to more than 2,000 new or improved beds already in progress at 27 facilities. When complete, these construction projects will create or improve more than 2,800 beds across the province, exceeding the government’s goal of building or renovating 2,500 beds over three years.

“Our seniors deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and to have the right supports in place as they age,” said Premier Tim Houston. “The investments we are making will ensure older Nova Scotians have access to modern facilities when they need them and a skilled workforce to care for them.”

The 500 new long-term care beds will be built in Halifax Regional Municipality. A request for qualified suppliers was issued today, February 7, to determine who will be eligible to build the facilities.

The 27 previously approved long-term care projects are at various stages of development, and the first facilities will open in 2023.

“Nova Scotians have to wait far too long to get into a long-term care facility and part of the solution is building more single-bed rooms and staffing them properly,” said Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams. “Almost 2,000 people need a place in long-term care, and hundreds of them are waiting in a hospital. We need to make sure people get the care they need, and hospital beds are available for people who need them. With an aging population that is amongst the oldest in Canada, the need for this investment is even more urgent.”

Investing in long-term care facilities is another step in the Province’s plan to provide additional support to the continuing care sector. The projects generate billions of dollars of economic impact across the province. These investments will also create thousands of jobs in engineering, construction and healthcare.

Quotes:
“Today’s announced investments in infrastructure and related resources is very positive news for those who live and work in long-term care.  Building new or renovating existing facilities to meet current design standards, including single rooms, will promote improved, safe care and enhance residents’ quality of life.”
     - Mary Lee, President and CEO, Health Association Nova Scotia

“Northwood is thrilled to be a part of this incredible investment in long-term care. The planning for a state-of-the-art facility in Fall River is underway. This new facility will provide a home for 144 individuals and will be a part of a larger campus that will support seniors and the community to live more. The Shoreham Village Facility in Chester will also be undergoing a complete transformation. In addition to the investment to improve living spaces for the existing 89 residents, the new facility will have a total of 96 beds to better serve the community.”
     - Janet Simm, President and CEO, Northwood

Quick Facts:
-- as of today, February 7, there are 1,936 people on the long-term care waitlist, with 333 waiting in hospital
-- about 7,500 Nova Scotians live in a long-term care facility
-- more than 21 per cent of Nova Scotia’s population is over 65 years old, the third-highest percentage in the country

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 6 février, le lieutenant-gouverneur Arthur J. LeBlanc a procédé à une cérémonie du lever du drapeau pour marquer le début de l’année du jubilé de platine de la reine qui souligne ses 70 ans au service des Canadiens et des Canadiennes et des citoyens et des citoyennes du Commonwealth. 

Il s’agit là d’un événement historique sans précédent. La reine est le chef d’État du Canada qui a régné le plus longtemps et elle est la première à célébrer un jubilé de platine. 
La cérémonie, qui s’est tenue à l’extérieur de la Résidence du gouverneur, comptait la présence de membres des Forces armées canadiennes et de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada qui ont hissé le drapeau canadien personnel de la reine. 

À cause de la pandémie, le public n’était pas invité. La vidéo de la cérémonie, qui comporte un discours du lieutenant-gouverneur LeBlanc, est disponible sur la page Facebook du lieutenant-gouverneur à l’adresse https://www.facebook.com/LtGovNS.  

Le lieutenant-gouverneur LeBlanc fait remarquer que l’année du jubilé de platine est une occasion de rendre hommage aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui ont servi leurs collectivités et la province. 

« Le règne de Sa Majesté incarne l’importance du service envers le pays et la collectivité, a-t-il dit, et c’est pourquoi le jubilé de platine fournira aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse des occasions de se réunir et de rendre hommage à leurs concitoyens qui ont fait preuve d’un sens de l’engagement inébranlable durant la pandémie. »

Le lieutenant-gouverneur organisera des activités à la Résidence du gouverneur et partout dans la province en 2022, y compris des réceptions en plein air, des prestations musicales, des présentations, des dévoilements et des films. Cet été, le lieutenant-gouverneur LeBlanc dédiera un jardin à la reine à la Résidence du gouverneur. Le jardin sera un hommage vivant à son service, et il sera aménagé en hommage au rapport spécial entre la Couronne et les peuples autochtones, rapport qui est un aspect fondamental du Canada moderne.

Faits en bref-- Le roi Georges VI est mort le 6 février 1952 pendant que la princesse Elizabeth était au Kenya. 
-- La reine a visité la Nouvelle-Écosse à cinq reprises, soit en 1951, 1959, 1976, 1994 et 2010. 
-- Lors de sa dernière visite en Nouvelle-Écosse en 2010, la reine a assisté à des activités en hommage au grand chef Henri Membertou, elle a marqué le centenaire de la Marine royale canadienne et elle a procédé à la deuxième inauguration de la Résidence du gouverneur.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc held a flag-raising ceremony today, February 6, to mark the commencement of the Platinum Jubilee Year, marking the Queen’s 70 years of service to Canadians and people throughout the Commonwealth. 

This is an unprecedented historic event; the Queen is Canada’s longest reigning head of state and the first to celebrate a platinum jubilee. 

The ceremony, outside of Government House in Halifax, included members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who hoisted the Queen’s personal Canadian flag. 

Due to COVID-19, the flag raising was closed to the public. The ceremony, with remarks from Lt.-Gov. LeBlanc, is available on the Lieutenant-Governor’s Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/LtGovNS 

Lt.-Gov. LeBlanc notes that the Platinum Jubilee Year is a time to honour Nova Scotians who have served their communities and the province. 

“As Her Majesty’s reign embodies the importance of service to one’s country and community, the Platinum Jubilee will provide opportunities for Nova Scotians to come together and recognize fellow citizens who have demonstrated an unwavering sense of commitment throughout the pandemic,” he said.

The Lieutenant-Governor will host events at Government House and across the province throughout 2022, including garden parties, musical performances, presentations, unveilings and films. This summer, Lt.-Gov. LeBlanc will dedicate a garden at Government House to the Queen as a living tribute to her service, and in tribute to the special Crown-Indigenous relationship that is a foundational aspect of modern Canada.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","11 New Hospital Admissions, Six Discharges, One Death, State of Emergency Renewed","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--11 New Hospital Admissions, Six Discharges, One Death, State of Emergency Renewed 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Today, February 4, Nova Scotia is reporting 11 new hospital admissions and six discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 70s in Central Zone has died.

“We have suffered significant loss of life in the last week. My sincere condolences to the 15 families who have lost loved ones,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Nova Scotia is a small and tight-knit province, and these losses touch us all. I want to thank those who have gotten vaccinated including their booster dose. If you haven’t booked your booster or any doses of vaccine, there is an appointment available to book now.” 

There are 99 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 15 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 2-95 years old. The average age is 66, and the average length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 7.9 days.

“It saddens me to learn that this virus has taken another Nova Scotian. I offer my deepest sympathies to this man’s family and loved ones,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We need to continue to be cautious about COVID, carefully balancing measures that limit the spread of Omicron and its impact on our most vulnerable and our healthcare system, with starting to gradually lift restrictions. Easing restrictions will be possible because of our province’s high vaccination rate and the hard work of Nova Scotians.”

Of the 99 people in hospital, 92 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 25 (25.3 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 44 (44.4 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 1 (1.0 per cent) is partially vaccinated
-- 29 (29.3 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 126 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 139 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of February 3, 2,145,666 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 91.4 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 84.4 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 57.1 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 3.7 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

On February 3, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 3,204 tests. An additional 594 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 245 cases in Central Zone, 116 cases in Eastern Zone, 104 cases in Northern Zone and 129 cases in Western Zone.

As of today, there are an estimated 3,769 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Hospital and Long-Term Care Outbreaks:

NSHA is reporting additional cases related to the outbreaks in three hospitals: 
-- five additional patients in a ward at Aberdeen Hospital in New Glasgow; fewer than 10 patients have tested positive
-- one additional patient in a ward at Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville; fewer than five patients have tested positive

The Province is reporting two outbreaks in long-term care facilities:
-- six staff members have tested positive at Nakile Home for Special Care in Glenwood, Yarmouth County
-- three staff members have tested positive at Mountain Lea Lodge in Bridgetown. 

Public health is working with the facilities to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

The Province is renewing the state of emergency to protect the health and safety of Nova Scotians and ensure safety measures and other important actions can continue. The order will take effect at noon, Sunday, February 6, and extend to noon, Sunday, February 20, unless the government terminates or extends it.

"Health and Wellness","Nova Scotia Moving to Biosimilar Drugs for Pharmacare Programs","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Nova Scotia Moving to Biosimilar Drugs for Pharmacare Programs
----------------------------------------------------------------
Starting today, February 4, Nova Scotians enrolled in Pharmacare programs will begin switching to a biosimilar version of certain biologic drugs, including some insulins and medications used for treating Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. 

Biosimilars have been used in Pharmacare programs in Nova Scotia since 2016, when the first biosimilar version of a drug was added to the list of approved drugs. However, many patients remain on their original higher-cost biologic versions.

“The evidence is clear that biosimilars are a safe and effective form of drug therapy for many patients,” said Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness. “If we’re able to provide the same high-quality treatment to our patients for lower cost, it’s our duty to do so. The cost savings from this change will be reinvested in healthcare, meaning even more people will get the care and treatment they deserve.”

The Nova Scotia biosimilar initiative follows similar efforts elsewhere in Canada. Tens of thousands of Canadians have safely switched to a biosimilar as part of those initiatives. They are also used extensively in Europe, where countries have had over 15 years of experience with biosimilars.

Pharmacare beneficiaries will have 12 months to work with their healthcare providers to switch to the biosimilar version of their drug. The policy change involves certain insulins, used to treat diabetes, as well as drugs that are used for arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis.

A biologic is a drug manufactured with living organisms such as yeasts or proteins. A biosimilar drug is a highly similar but less expensive version of the original biologic medication, known as an originator drug.

Much like generics, biosimilar versions of drugs become available when the original manufacturer of a biologic drug no longer has patent protection. Other manufacturers are then able to produce the same drug, making the same therapy available at a lower cost.

Health Canada approves biosimilars using rigorous regulatory standards for quality, efficacy and safety, deeming them to be as equally effective as the relevant biologics.

Switching to biosimilars where they are available will save the Province an estimated $13 million annually once fully implemented. Additional savings are expected as more biosimilars become available in Canada.

Nova Scotia developed this policy after consultation with doctors, prescribers and patient advocacy groups. In very specific circumstances in which the patient is not able to transition to the biosimilar version, the prescriber can request an exemption to continue coverage of the existing product. 

Quotes:
“Annual spending on brand-name biologic medications continues to rise dramatically for public drug plans in Canada. Thirty-eight Health Canada-approved biosimilar biologics are now available. Arthritis Consumer Experts congratulates the Nova Scotia government on today’s announcement that will help ensure continued reimbursement coverage for patients who transition to a biologic biosimilar. Based on the experience in British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Quebec, and the Northwest Territories, where patients have already safely transitioned, we encourage the Government of Nova Scotia to work with chronic disease communities like ours to reinvest biosimilars savings in improving sustainability and adding new therapies for public drug plan beneficiaries.” 
     - Cheryl Koehn, Founder and President, Arthritis Consumer Experts

Quick Facts:
-- about 5,100 people in Nova Scotia Pharmacare programs are currently on biologics that will need to be switched; more than 3,600 are using specific insulins that have biosimilar versions available and more than 1,400 people are using other biologic drugs 
-- about 3,900 patients enrolled in Pharmacare programs are already using biosimilar versions of medications
-- other jurisdictions that have switched from originator biologics to biosimilars are British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, New Brunswick and Northwest Territories
-- specific originator drugs that will be switched are Humira, Enbrel, Remicade, Lantus, Humalog, NovoRapid and Rituxan
-- patients currently taking biologics will need to switch to the biosimilar version by February 3, 2023

Le variant Omicron continue d’avoir des conséquences désastreuses chez nos citoyens les plus vulnérables. La meilleure chose que vous pouvez faire pour vous protéger et pour protéger les autres est de vous faire vacciner ¬– avec votre série vaccinale primaire et puis avec la dose de rappel dès que vous êtes admissible. »

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","More Workers in Long-Term Care, Continuing Care Assistant Registry Open","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--More Workers in Long-Term Care, Continuing Care Assistant Registry Open
-----------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a feature on the addition of workers in long-term care through new programs for continuing care assistants.
-----------------------------------------------------
Staff shortages are a recurring issue in the long-term care sector. Continuing care students Amy Lake and Bryce MacDow are part of the solution.

They are two of 18 CBBC Career College students currently working in a long-term care facility under the Province’s new tuition support and work-and-learn programs for continuing care assistants. 

“This program has changed my life,” says Lake. “It is an amazing opportunity to be able to learn and work in a supportive, caring facility. This opportunity has given me the ability to further my education without financial concern and stress on my family.”

Lake and MacDow work two days a week providing care to residents at Dykeland Lodge in Windsor and attend classes the other three days.

“Learning in the classroom and on the job has been amazing,” says MacDow. “It has given me the confidence I need to perform my duties for residents who I know and together we share a bond. Helping residents and giving them the best possible care makes me happy and confident in my abilities.”

More help for the long-term care sector is on the way. By early March, almost 80 people will be working in long-term care facilities under the tuition support and work-and-learn programs for continuing care assistants, helping to reduce some of the staffing pressures in the sector. 

The programs are part of the Province’s $57 million investment in the continuing care sector announced in December. It includes $22 million to cover tuition costs for more than 2,000 full- or part-time students. Under the work-and-learn program, students are paid and learn in a hands-on way.

“We are taking action to make a career in continuing care more attractive and accessible to ensure Nova Scotians have the care they need as they age,” says Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams. “There are now several ways people can train to become a continuing care assistant so students can choose the option that works best for them. These programs remove barriers and give more people the chance to enter the workforce.”

A clearer picture of the workforce will be available soon through the mandatory Continuing Care Assistants Registry, which opened today, February 2. All continuing care assistants working in the field are required to register to give the government and sector a better understanding of the workforce to help plan recruitment and retention efforts. It is also open to those who have training but are not actively employed in the field. 

The Continuing Care Assistants Registry Act was proclaimed and came into effect today.

Quotes:
“This program is attracting people who want a meaningful career to enter the workforce sooner because of their on-the-job experience. We’ll hire most of the students with other nursing homes happily offering them employment. There is huge need for continuing care assistants in our sector. The students will help to ease the workload of our dedicated staff now. This important initiative demonstrates to our staff that we are committed to providing quality care by ensuring staff have the help they need so they can take some much-needed time off.”
    - Krista Beeler, CEO, Dykeland Lodge, Windsor  

""Since the Province announced this exciting training initiative, hundreds of students have expressed interest in becoming a continuing care assistant. This will ensure hundreds of new graduates will enter the employment market in the next 12 months. Nursing homes, hospitals, and home care organizations have all expressed overwhelming interest in hiring continuing care assistants. I would encourage anyone thinking about this career to connect with the college and take advantage of this exciting opportunity.""
     - Henry Devlin, President and CEO, CBBC Career College 

“We're pleased about this announcement. The registry will help us understand how many continuing care assistants there are in the province and where in the province recruitment efforts are most needed. Continuing care assistants are the backbone of long-term care and a registry will help to recognize this as the important profession it is inside the health system.”
     - Dana Power, Regional Director Operations, Enhanced Care Nova Scotia, Shannex Inc.

Quick Facts:
-- students in the work and learn program enter the workforce after a 28-day foundation module, and graduate in 30 weeks 
-- currently, there are 18 students in the working portion of the program and 61 doing the 28-day foundation module 
-- the mandatory Continuing Care Assistant Registry is a recommendation of the Long-Term Care Expert Panel and in the Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister’s mandate letter
-- Health Association Nova Scotia is administering the mandatory Continuing Care Assistant Registry, which replaces the voluntary registry
-- people working as continuing care assistants need to register by June 30 and renew their registration each year

"Environment and Climate Change","Government Committed to Solar Power","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Government Committed to Solar Power
----------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Environment and Climate Change Minister Timothy Halman.
---------------------------------------------------------
Many Nova Scotians have made their feelings known about Nova Scotia Power’s application to increase electricity rates by 10 per cent and increase the cost for solar power.

Solar customers and installers are justifiably concerned for the survival of the province’s solar industry.

I want to assure Nova Scotians and the solar industry that this government’s resolve in achieving our greenhouse gas emission targets – which includes the use of solar power to reduce emissions – is unwavering.

As the Minister responsible for the new and ambitious Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act, I am committed to achieving our legislated targets by 2030.

Our government will protect solar homeowners and small businesses in the solar industry by bringing forward regulations that will stop the proposed net-metering charge. I want to thank Premier Tim Houston and Minister Tory Rushton and the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables for taking this decisive action to continue our fight against climate change.

Nova Scotia has set one of the most ambitious targets in the country for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this, we need to expand access to renewable energy – and that includes solar.

We want Nova Scotians to continue to adopt solar. That is why we invest in programs to encourage Nova Scotians to switch to solar, including $8 million we recently announced for solar retrofits. The industry creates jobs and provides economic benefits. A system access charge for net-metered installations, the majority of which are solar, is not in line with that goal.

Our government will join other intervenors at the Utility and Review Board hearing into Nova Scotia Power’s rate application to ensure any changes granted to Nova Scotia Power are consistent with the goals of the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act and in the best interest of Nova Scotians.

-----------------------------------------------------------
The Province will protect solar homeowners and small businesses in the solar industry with regulations that will stop the proposed net-metering charge in Nova Scotia Power’s most recent rate application.

Premier Tim Houston sent a letter notifying the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board (NSUARB) of the government’s plans today, February 2.

“We agree that it is time for changes to the enhanced net-metering program but the changes we seek will support the greening of the grid, not discourage it,” said Premier Houston. “Our government will bring forward the necessary legislative and regulatory framework that will protect ratepayers and the solar industry in Nova Scotia and help achieve our environment and climate change reduction goals.” 

Nova Scotia Power has proposed that, beginning February 1, 2023, new net-metering customers will pay a system access charge of $8 per kilowatt per month. While the charge is not yet in place, the Province will ensure that the charge will not take effect, preventing a direct and immediate negative impact on small businesses and homeowners across the province.

The Province’s framework will preserve the enhanced net-metering program as it was on January 26. The framework will be brought into force before the conclusion of the general rate application proceeding at the NSUARB.

“We have come too far in our fight against climate change and expanding access to renewable energy to risk that progress,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “The changes we will bring forward will stop the proposed system access charge in its tracks today and provide certainty for our solar industry and rate-paying families investing in solar.”

The government is also bringing in further measures to grow the solar industry in Nova Scotia, with enhancements to the commercial and community solar programs. These enhancements will make solar power more accessible to everyone, including renters, small businesses and marginalized communities. These changes will also allow for larger solar projects for communities, farms and businesses.

Climate change is one of the biggest global issues today, and Nova Scotia has set one of the most ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving that target requires a range of solutions to expand access to renewable energy, including solar energy.

Quick Facts:
-- the Province has committed to 80 per cent of Nova Scotia’s electricity needs being supplied by renewable energy by 2030
-- there are now more than 4,000 solar homes across Nova Scotia
-- the solar industry contributed approximately $30 million in private-sector investment to the provincial economy last year
-- the proposed net-metering charges from Nova Scotia Power are not in line with the new Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Avian Influenza Confirmed in Nova Scotia","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Avian Influenza Confirmed in Nova Scotia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Department is notifying the public that avian influenza has been detected in Nova Scotia.

On Friday, January 28, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed a Canada goose in the Grand Desert area of Halifax Regional Municipality tested positive.

Avian influenza is a viral infection that can spread easily and quickly among birds. There are at least 15 types of avian influenza. Some wild bird species, such as ducks, can carry the virus and infect other birds without getting sick themselves. Other bird species are more likely to become severely ill and die when infected with some types of avian influenza.

As a general guideline, the public should not handle live, sick or dead wild birds. People should contact the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables at 1-800-565-2224 to report sick or dead birds.

The Province is working with the federal government and other agencies to monitor and respond to the situation.

Quotes:
“Avian influenza poses little risk to people, but the virus is highly infectious and potentially deadly in wild and domestic birds. We urge the public to avoid feeding or handling wild birds like ducks, geese, pheasants, pigeons and gulls to prevent disease spread.”
     - Bob Petrie, Director of Wildlife, Natural Resources and Renewables

Quick Facts:
-- birds which meet testing criteria will be collected and sent to the lab at the Atlantic Veterinary College in Charlottetown
-- avian flu has been detected recently in other parts of Canada and the eastern United States

"COVID - 19 / Seniors and Long-Term Care / Advanced Education","Healthcare Students and Instructors to Support Long-term Care and Acute-Care Sectors","ADVANCED EDUCATION/SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Healthcare Students and Instructors to Support Long-term Care and Acute-Care Sectors
-----------------------------------------------------------
Post-secondary leaders, healthcare students and instructors are stepping up to support long-term care and acute-care patients and residents.

Long-term care and acute-care settings are experiencing staff shortages because of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus and ongoing vacancies. In response, a request was made to post-secondary leaders and nursing, continuing care assistant and licenced practical nurse students and their instructors at Dalhousie University, St. Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University, Université Sainte-Anne and the Nova Scotia Community College to support long-term care and acute-care facilities over the next month.

“I could not be more proud of how quickly we were able to come together with the post-secondary sector and students to come up with solutions to help Nova Scotians,” said Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education. “I want to thank the post-secondary leaders, administrators, staff and students for their collaboration, flexibility and willingness to adapt their traditional program delivery and partner with us on this effort. This is an exceptional chance for students to build skills, make workforce connections and help their fellow healthcare colleagues while helping the Nova Scotians who need them the most.”

For most of the students, these placements will be expedited clinical placements as part of their program of study. Placements that were already confirmed for students in acute-care programs will proceed as planned.

For others who have already completed their clinical placements, it will be a short-term employment opportunity. Students will be fully supported and observed onsite by their instructors and other supervisors who have also agreed to be a part of this effort.

Students who accept a placement and are not already being compensated through a co-op or other type of paid placement will receive a $1,000 honorarium.

This will not significantly increase students’ workload beyond current course requirements, and it will support their educational outcomes. Key program milestones, like graduation, will remain on track.

“This is an urgent situation. Students and their instructors have the chance to be part of an historic solution that will help long-term care residents, workers and their families,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “I am personally grateful they are taking on this challenge. They represent what it truly means to be a compassionate Nova Scotian, and I hope they inspire other healthcare workers not currently in the workforce to follow in their footsteps and help us through this difficult time.”

Health Association Nova Scotia, the post-secondary sector, Nova Scotia Health and the Province are working collaboratively on the logistics to determine where the help is needed most and what skills and experience are required.

Quotes:
“The level of collaboration and partnership that is occurring to respond to the staffing shortages arising from the Omicron variant and ongoing vacancies is unbelievable. The accelerated placement of students in long-term care facilities will help provide much-needed relief and support for the dedicated staff who have been working tirelessly throughout the pandemic and ensure residents continue to receive the quality care and comfort they deserve.”
     - Mary Lee, President and CEO, Health Association Nova Scotia

“Our practical nursing and continuing care assistant program students are training to be caring health professionals. As we bring this important opportunity to them, I anticipate many will step forward to help care for these important yet vulnerable citizens in our communities as we continue to face the pandemic challenges together.”
     - Don Bureaux, President, Nova Scotia Community College

Quick Facts:
-- up to 1,500 students and their instructors could be eligible to participate
-- as of today, January 28, 26 long-term care facilities are closed to admissions due to the workforce shortage
-- there are currently 1,913 people on the long-term care waitlist with 312 waiting in hospital

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, January 28, Nova Scotia is reporting 10 new hospital admissions and six discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting one death related to COVID-19: a man in his 60s in Western Zone has died.

“It’s never easy to learn that another Nova Scotian lost their life because of this virus. I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends grieving,” said Premier Tim Houston. “This has been a difficult week for our province. As we head into the weekend, please let this be a sad reminder to slow down your activities, minimize your contacts and follow the public health measures in place.”

There are 88 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 15 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 35-100 years old. The average age is 67, and the average length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 7.6 days.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of the man who has passed away,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Now more than ever, we need to come together as a province and do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another Nova Scotian. Together we can slow the spread of this virus. ”

Of the 88 people in hospital, 85 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

-- 104 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 130 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of January 27, 2,094,109 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 91.1 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 83.5 per cent have received their second dose.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is protecting renters by extending the ban on ending a residential lease for the purpose of renovations.

“We are extending the ban so our most vulnerable citizens continue to be protected during the pandemic,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “With the uncertainty of the pandemic continuing, and with the province still being in a state of emergency, we need to extend this temporary measure to help keep people in their homes.”

The ban was scheduled to end February 1, 2022, or when the state of emergency was lifted, whichever came first. With this change, the ban on ending a residential lease for the purpose of renovations is being extended until the state of emergency ends or the ban is repealed, whichever comes first.
 
Quick Facts:
-- the Province introduced the ban on landlords ending a lease for renovations on November 25, 2020
-- the Residential Tenancies Act was amended in October 2021 to enhance tenant protections in situations where the landlord needs to end a lease for the purpose of renovations; the new rules will come into effect when the ban ends
-- the temporary two per cent rent cap was extended through legislation until December 31, 2023

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Shubenacadie Sam Ready For Groundhog Day","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Shubenacadie Sam Ready For Groundhog Day
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians are invited to celebrate Groundhog Day virtually by watching Shubenacadie Sam’s annual prediction on social media.

Shubenacadie Sam will emerge from her burrow at Shubenacadie Wildlife Park Wednesday, February 2, at 8 a.m, to make her annual spring weather prediction. Sam’s forecast will be streamed on the wildlife park’s Facebook page.

“Nova Scotians love talking about the weather and Groundhog Day celebrates the important role weather plays in our lives and culture,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “Because of our geography, Nova Scotians will be the first to know if Shubenacadie Sam predicts an early spring or six more weeks of winter.”

Folklore says winter will last for six more weeks if the groundhog sees its shadow, while no shadow is a sign of an early spring.

The wildlife park will also celebrate World Wetlands Day on February 2. Wetlands provide important habitats for hundreds of wildlife species, including species at risk. They also mitigate the effects of climate change by absorbing carbon and buffering coastal communities from rises in sea level and storm surges.

Shubenacadie Wildlife Park is open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekends during the winter. It is closed on February 2. There will be no public events for Groundhog Day at the park this year.

Quick Facts:
-- Shubenacadie Sam will be the first groundhog to make a prediction, about an hour before other groundhogs in Ontario and the eastern United States

------------------------------------------------------
Martin Herschorn, QC, will retire as the Director of Public Prosecutions on Friday, February 4 – 50 years to the day after entering the public service of Nova Scotia.

Mr. Herschorn joined the Department of Attorney General in 1972. He later moved to the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service (PPS) upon its creation in 1990 as Canada’s first statutorily independent public prosecution service under the Public Prosecutions Act.

Mr. Herschorn was appointed Director of Public Prosecutions 21 years ago. He has led the PPS through an evolution of substantive changes in criminal law and has overseen a myriad of high-profile prosecutions that have gained national and sometimes international attention.

He has served under five governments and 10 different attorneys general and has seen the PPS grow from a handful of Crown attorneys to more than 100.

Mr. Herschorn is the longest-serving head of a prosecution agency nationally and is considered an elder statesman among Canadian prosecutorial leaders. He is a past member of the executive committee of the International Association of Prosecutors and is currently a member of the association’s Senate.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotia is very fortunate to have had such a distinguished lawyer lead its Public Prosecution Service for the past two decades and as Attorney General, I want to wish him the very best in retirement and thank him for his years of service to Nova Scotians.”
     - Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice

“The last 21 years as the Director of Public Prosecutions have been the most rewarding of my career.  I am extremely proud of the dedicated men and women who comprise the PPS and who work hard to serve the public interest by performing prosecution duties with fairness, professionalism, and integrity.”
     - Martin E. Herschorn, QC, Director of Public Prosecutions 

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia’s 100 Crown attorneys prosecute about 40,000 new Criminal Code charges and 4,000 provincial regulatory offences each year

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Community Organizations To Create Safe, Affordable Places to Live in Halifax Regional Municipality","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Community Organizations To Create Safe, Affordable Places to Live in Halifax Regional Municipality
------------------------------------------------------------
There will soon be 20 more safe, supportive, affordable places to live in Halifax Regional Municipality, thanks to investments from the federal, provincial and municipal governments.

“Housing isn’t just about putting a roof over someone’s head; sometimes, it’s about finding the supports people need to tackle the other challenges life has put in their way,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are pleased to work with our community partners to provide housing for people in need.”

The new affordable housing units will be created through projects in Dartmouth and Chezzetcook:
-- Akoma Holdings will operate eight townhomes on Main Street in Dartmouth, offering affordable housing designed to support African Nova Scotians from the Preston area
-- Souls Harbour Rescue Mission will offer a 12-unit supportive housing facility in Chezzetcook for women and children who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless; it will include meals, bedding, clothing, toiletries and activities for residents.

The two projects will receive close to $6.5 million from the Government of Canada through the Cities Stream of the Rapid Housing Initiative. The Province will contribute a total of $500,000 to the projects.

Quotes:
“Every Canadian deserves the peace of mind of a safe and affordable place to call home. Today's funding will go a long way to support those who need it most.  These projects, in addition to the one that was announced yesterday in Dartmouth, will quickly provide 85 new affordable homes for Halifax’s most vulnerable population to help keep them safe. This is one of the ways our National Housing Strategy continues to ensure that no one is left behind.”
     - Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation

“The Rapid Housing Initiative is a testament to what can happen when all orders of government and social agencies join in common purpose to build much-needed affordable homes and address the housing crisis. Together, we can improve the lives of vulnerable people by starting with safe, secure, stable housing.”
     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality

“We’re really excited about this project. It will provide affordable homes in the Preston community, where they are much needed, and allow people to live closer to their families and their support network.”
     - Spencer Colley, board member, Akoma Holdings

“This funding could not have come at a better time with Halifax currently in the middle of a housing crisis. Imagine, in one year, we will open our doors and turn over the keys to 12 women who are in desperate need of housing along with their children.”
     - Michelle Porter, co-founder and CEO, Souls Harbour Rescue Mission

« Il s'agit d'une autre journée difficile pour notre province après la perte d'une autre personne en raison de la COVID-19, souligne le premier ministre Tim Houston. Je ne peux pas répéter assez souvent à quel point il est important de se faire vacciner avec la dose appropriée dès que possible.

Il s'agit d'un triste rappel de la nature grave de ce virus et de son impact sur les gens et leurs familles, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La meilleure façon de procéder est toujours de respecter les mesures sanitaires et les restrictions en vigueur, et de se faire vacciner. »

---------------------------------------------------------
Today, January 27, Nova Scotia is reporting 11 new hospital admissions and seven discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting one death related to COVID-19: a woman in her 70s in Central Zone.

“This is another difficult day for our province as another Nova Scotian is taken from us because of COVID,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I cannot stress enough the importance of getting vaccinated with the dose you need as soon as you are able. We must all do what we can to protect ourselves and others.”

There are 93 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 15 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 6-100 years old. The average age is 67, and the average length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 7.5 days.

“It is never easy reporting a COVID death, as it is a stark reminder of the serious nature of this virus and the impact it has on people and their families,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Our way forward continues to be following the public health measures and restrictions in place and getting vaccinated.”

Of the 93 people in hospital, 90 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 19 (20.4 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 55 (59.1 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 1 (1.1 per cent) is partially vaccinated
-- 18 (19.4 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 107 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 127 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of January 26, 2,079,773 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 91 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 83.4 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 50.4 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose, and 7.4 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment.

Cases and Testing:

On January 26, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 3,318 tests. An additional 366 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 155 cases in Central Zone, 41 cases in Eastern Zone, 44 cases in Northern Zone and 126 cases in Western Zone.

As of today, there are an estimated 4,276 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Long-Term Care Outbreaks:

The Province is reporting two outbreaks in long-term care facilities:

"Nova Scotia Securities Commission","Investor Alert for GoldBachInvest","NOVA SCOTIA SECURITIES COMMISSION--Investor Alert for GoldBachInvest
----------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting investors that GoldBachInvest, operating online at www.goldbachinvest.com, is not registered to engage in the business of trading in securities or derivatives in Nova Scotia.

GoldBachInvest claims to be the world’s most popular trading platform providing investors with access to stocks, indices, crypto, foreign exchange, commodities and other financial instruments. It also claims to be an award-winning broker registered and located in the Marshall Islands.

At least one Nova Scotia resident lost money after investing with GoldBachInvest. Requests for withdrawals and return of funds were ignored. After the investor ceased contact with GoldBachInvest, GoldBachInvest still managed to obtain more money from the investor’s bank account.

The commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with firms that are not registered in Nova Scotia. People can contact their local securities regulator to report investment scams or what they believe to be suspicious behaviour from anyone offering investment opportunities.

Quotes: 
“Protect your financial well-being by taking the time to become informed. Investing in unregistered entities can be high-risk given they are not subject to the same investor protection requirements as those who are registered. When opening accounts with these entities, you are also generally required to provide intimate personal and financial details. Providing this type of information to fraudsters puts you at risk for further financial harm.”
     - Stephanie Atkinson, Director of Enforcement, Nova Scotia Securities Commission

Quick Facts: 
-- it is illegal to solicit investments in Nova Scotia without registering with the commission and complying with Nova Scotia securities laws, unless an exemption applies

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is taking action to help people experiencing homelessness by working with the Government of Canada and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to create 65 new permanent supportive housing options.

The former Travelodge hotel in Dartmouth is being converted to supportive housing units for people who are chronically unhoused. The hotel will be renamed The Overlook and be operated by the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia and the North End Community Health Centre.

“Many people experiencing chronic homelessness need additional support to maintain housing,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “This partnership will provide the supports needed for people to live safe and meaningful lives within their community. We look forward to welcoming people to their new home.” 

The Overlook is the first harm reduction focused housing project in Nova Scotia. Wraparound services for residents will include occupational therapy, onsite nursing and addictions counselling, harm reduction services and peer support. 

The federal government and HRM are contributing $6.5 million through the Cities Stream under the Rapid Housing Initiative. The Province is providing $3.5 million to purchase the former hotel and will cover $1.5 million in annual operating costs. 

Quotes:

This is one of the ways our National Housing Strategy continues to ensure that no one is left behind.”

We’re always stronger when we work together, and good initiatives like this one are strengthened by having all orders of government at the table.”
     - Darren Fisher, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Seniors and Member of Parliament for Dartmouth-Cole Harbour

“The Rapid Housing Initiative is a testament to what can happen when all orders of government and social agencies join in common purpose to build much-needed affordable homes and address the housing crisis.

     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality

“The Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia is thrilled to be a partner with the North End Community Health Centre in buying and operating the former Travelodge and converting it to supportive housing.

"Environment and Climate Change","French River Watershed Designated as Protected Water Area","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--French River Watershed Designated as Protected Water Area
-------------------------------------------------------
The watershed that gives the people of Tatamagouche their drinking water is now protected provincially, further safeguarding their access to quality water.

Environment and Climate Change Minister Tim Halman designated the French River watershed as a protected water area on Monday, January 24. This means that regulations under the Environment Act will help to protect the water that people in the Village of Tatamagouche use in their homes, businesses and to support services in their community.

“I am pleased to designate the French River watershed as a protected water area, which will help meet the needs of the people of Tatamagouche, enhance their quality of life and support economic growth and prosperity,” said Minister Halman. “A reliable supply of quality drinking water is essential to maintaining the health of Nova Scotians, as well as community and environmental health. Our government is working with Nova Scotians and other levels of government to ensure everyone in our province has the support and services they need to build strong, sustainable, thriving communities.”

The protected water area regulations protect drinking water supplies by giving municipalities the authority to manage watersheds, including restricting or prohibiting activities that may impact water quality or quantity. After a watershed is designated as a protected water area, the utility is responsible for protecting the area and enforcing the regulations.

The Municipality of the County of Colchester owns and operates the Tatamagouche water utility.

Quotes:
“The watershed provides water for the village of Tatamagouche. It’s important that we maintain the pristine water that the village is fortunate enough to have. I am pleased the government has taken into consideration the work that was done to protect the watershed and has designated it as a protected water area. Kudos need to go to the staff of the municipality for the work that went into getting here and to the community for standing up to be heard. I am over the moon.”
     - Michael Gregory, Councillor, Municipality of the County of Colchester and Chair, Tatamagouche Source Water Protection Committee

Quick Facts:
-- the French River watershed covers about 141 square kilometres along the Northumberland Strait
-- the watershed’s headwaters begin in the Cobequid Mountains and drain into Tatamagouche Bay
-- the Municipality of the County of Colchester approved protecting the French River watershed in January 2020
-- the Tatamagouche Source Water Protection Committee developed regulations that were sent to the Department with a request for designation
-- there are 24 designated protected water areas in Nova Scotia

The Province is making a prime piece of land in downtown Dartmouth available for a mixed-use project that includes affordable housing.

Develop Nova Scotia is calling for development proposals on a 5,375 square-metre parcel of land on King Street, within walking distance of the Alderney Ferry Terminal, parks, walking trails and shops. It is currently used as a parking lot.

“This is an exciting chance to see more accessible and affordable housing in the heart of downtown Dartmouth,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “We are looking at our inventory of provincially owned land to determine what’s best suited for housing and will offer more plots for development as quickly as possible.”

To stimulate new ideas, approaches and partnerships, Develop Nova Scotia is not prescribing a specific program or framework for the development of the site. It is an open invitation to housing developers, service providers and other community organizations.

Proponents are expected to demonstrate a collaborative and financially sustainable approach. They must show ability and expertise in the areas of construction, operations and administration.

The property development opportunity is available at: https://developns.ca/projects/wdc1/ . The first deadline is March 28. After that, successful proponents will be asked to take part in a second, more detailed phase.

Quotes:
“We’ve designed this opportunity to invite the creativity of developers and social impact organizations to bring an innovative approach to building housing that is attainable, sustainable and desirable. Our goal is to challenge each other to make a valuable development site in the heart of our urban centre work harder to meet the social and environmental needs of our community.”
     - Jennifer Angel, President and CEO, Develop Nova Scotia

“This holds real potential to increase housing supply and add additional affordable units in the urban core. Housing solutions rest with all orders of government, and I am pleased to see the Province working with the expertise of Develop Nova Scotia to make this opportunity happen.”
     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality

Quick Facts:

-------------------------------------------------------
Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de 30 ans ou plus peuvent maintenant prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer contre la COVID-19.

Plus de 55 000 rendez-vous pour le vaccin de Pfizer ont été ajoutés dans des cliniques à l'échelle de la province plus tôt cette semaine, mais ils étaient réservés aux personnes âgées de 12 à 29 pour les raisons suivantes :
-- Les jeunes de 12 à 17 ans peuvent seulement recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer pour leur première ou leur deuxième dose (ce groupe d'âge n'est pas encore admissible à la dose de rappel).
-- On encourage fortement les personnes de 18 à 29 ans à recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer à titre de première ou deuxième dose ou de dose de rappel, en raison du risque rare mais accru de myocardite et de péricardite chez les jeunes adultes après l'administration du vaccin de Moderna comparativement au vaccin de Pfizer.

On encourage toute personne de 30 ans ou plus qui a déjà pris rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Moderna à garder ce rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin plus rapidement et réduire le gaspillage des vaccins.

On rappelle aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse que pour être considérée comme étant entièrement vaccinée, une personne doit recevoir une combinaison des vaccins à deux doses de Pfizer, Moderna ou AstraZeneca contre la COVID-19 ou le vaccin Janssen à une dose. Une personne est entièrement vaccinée 14 jours après la dernière dose. L'intervalle entre la première et la deuxième dose en Nouvelle-Écosse est de 56 jours.

Les personnes qui ont une déficience immunitaire moyenne à grave sont admissibles à recevoir une troisième dose du vaccin pour compléter leur série primaire. Une troisième dose peut être reçue 56 jours après la deuxième dose.

Les gens de 18 ans ou plus sont admissibles à une dose de rappel au moins 168 jours après leur série principale de vaccins. Seuls les vaccins à base d'ARNm de Pfizer et de Moderna sont offerts pour les doses de rappel en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Toute personne admissible à recevoir le vaccin contre la COVID-19 peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou en composant le numéro sans frais 1-833-797-7772.

------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians who are 30 and older are now able to schedule an appointment for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

More than 55,000 Pfizer appointments were added to clinics across the province earlier this week, but booking had been restricted to people 12 to 29 because:
-- people 12 to 17 can receive only the Pfizer vaccine for their first or second dose (this age group is not eligible for a booster dose)
-- Pfizer is strongly recommended for people 18 to 29 for their first, second or booster dose; there is recent evidence that shows there is a rare but increased risk of myocarditis/pericarditis in young adults from Moderna vaccine as compared to Pfizer vaccine.

Anyone who is 30 and older and currently has a Moderna appointment is encouraged to keep their appointment so they can receive their vaccine sooner and to reduce vaccine wastage.

Nova Scotians are reminded that to be fully vaccinated, they need any two-dose combination of the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines or the one-dose Janssen vaccine. People are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their final dose. The interval between first and second doses in Nova Scotia is 56 days.

People who are moderately to severely immunocompromised are eligible for a third dose of vaccine to complete their primary series. A third dose can be booked 56 days after the second dose.

People 18 and older are eligible for a booster dose at least 168 days after their primary series. Only Pfizer’s and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines are available for use as booster doses in Nova Scotia.

Anyone eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine can schedule an appointment online at https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling the toll-free line: 1-833-797-7772.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Funding for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Funding for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
--------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing $500,000 to help install more electric vehicle charging stations in Nova Scotia.

“Nova Scotia is a national leader in acting on climate change by reducing emissions. Electric vehicles can play a big role in reducing emissions and helping us achieve our goals of having a cleaner economy that creates jobs, supports a healthy environment, and benefits all Nova Scotians,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “Having more community chargers will give people reliable options so they can use their electric vehicles anywhere in the province.” 

The provincial investment is in addition to the $1.2 million recently announced through the federal Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program. Clean Foundation will administer the funding and will seek proposals from organizations to install up to 250 Level 2 electric vehicle chargers. 

The chargers will be installed across the province in public areas and will support light-duty vehicles.

Quotes:
“As electric vehicle adoption in Nova Scotia continues to grow, having reliable infrastructure in place, like establishing up to 250 more publicly accessible electric vehicle charging stations, will be critical. Government investments like this one will continue to help pave the future for electric vehicle ownership and encourage drivers to make the switch by 2030.”
     - Erin Burbidge, Director, Policy and Programs, Clean Foundation

“Embracing green infrastructure will be a key to our collective success as we move towards a net-zero future. More electric charging stations right here in Nova Scotia means more opportunities for communities to make greener choices, and I’m pleased that this new funding will now allow people to drive from one end of our province to the other in an electric vehicle.”
     - Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship and Member of Parliament for Central Nova, on behalf of Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Natural Resources

Quick Facts: 
-- Clean Foundation expects to start accepting proposal submissions from interested organizations in February
-- eligible organizations include electricity or gas utilities, companies, industry and research associations, standards organizations, Indigenous and community groups, academic institutions, and different levels of government
-- the Minister’s mandate letter includes actions to help transition to a clean and renewable energy future, including working with the auto sector to sell more zero-emission vehicles and providing funding to support the installation of more electric vehicle charging stations

"Office of Addictions and Mental Health","New Centre for Addictions Care Opening in Dartmouth","ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--New Centre for Addictions Care Opening in Dartmouth
------------------------------------------------------
A new service for people struggling with substance use and gambling addictions will open in Dartmouth next week.

The recovery support centre will be the first local hub for adults requiring less intensive withdrawal management support. Services will include in-person assessments, group programming, and recovery and harm reduction supports. On-site withdrawal support and one-on-one programming will be added in the coming months.

Recovery support centres are also expected to open over the next two years in Truro, Cape Breton and Halifax.

“We need to do better by those living with addictions,” said Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health. “This includes enhancing supports and creating better access to the right level of care. This new centre will provide support to those who don’t require around-the-clock inpatient care and can safely and successfully recover from addictions while remaining at home and in their community.”

The centre will also function as a community hub, linking people to care based on their individual needs, such as more intensive in-hospital withdrawal care, opioid-use disorder treatment, and community mental health and addictions programs. It will also provide support for some patients discharged from in-hospital withdrawal care.

The centre opens Tuesday, January 25. People can access supports and services by visiting the centre at 45 Alderney Drive, calling the centre directly at 902-425-3439, or by calling the Mental Health and Addictions Intake Service at 1-855-922-1122. Referrals will also come through family physicians, emergency departments and community mental health and addiction clinics.

The recovery support centre will initially operate Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and be staffed by an interdisciplinary team, including a nurse practitioner, registered nurses, social workers and peer-support workers. The hours will be extended in the coming months as additional clinical staff are hired.

Quotes:
“The recovery support centre will provide people access to timely and safe care for substance-use disorders, enhancing the service delivery model within Nova Scotia Health. It is our hope that this service will improve treatment access, meet people where they happen to be in their recovery journey and provide service that helps address the physical, psychological, social and spiritual issues related to substance use.”
     - Dr. Dave Martell, Physician Lead, Addictions Medicine, Mental Health and Addictions Program, Nova Scotia Health

Quick Facts:
-- COVID-19 public health guidelines will be followed for drop-ins and scheduled appointments
-- the current location is temporary, and a process to identify a permanent site is underway
-- day supports for withdrawal management and substance use are currently available in Lunenburg, Yarmouth and Middleton

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","18 nouvelles hospitalisations, 11 congés, 3 décès","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--18 nouvelles hospitalisations, 11 congés, 3 décès 
-----------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 20 janvier, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que 18 personnes supplémentaires ont été hospitalisées et 11 personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également trois décès liés à la COVID-19 :
-- une femme dans la cinquantaine dans le secteur du centre
-- une septuagénaire dans le secteur du nord
-- un septuagénaire dans le secteur de l'est

« Ce virus a emporté trois autres Néo-Écossais, et je suis attristé pour les familles et les amis de ces personnes, souligne le premier ministre Tim Houston. Tout le monde doit prendre la vague Omicron au sérieux et travailler ensemble pour protéger les gens les plus vulnérables, notre système de soins de santé et nos communautés. »

À l'heure actuelle, 85 personnes ayant contracté la COVID-19 sont hospitalisées et reçoivent des soins spécialisés dans des unités particulières. De ce nombre, 12 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 0 à 100 ans. L'âge moyen est de 68 ans et la durée moyenne du séjour à l'hôpital en raison de la COVID-19 est de 6,8 jours.

« J'offre mes condoléances et mes prières à la famille et aux proches des trois personnes qui sont décédées, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La vague Omicron est différente de celles que nous avons vécues au cours des deux dernières années, mais il n'y a aucun doute que le virus a des répercussions très grave chez certaines personnes. Je vous prie de faire le nécessaire pour prévenir un autre décès. Respectez les restrictions et faites-vous vacciner, qu'il s'agisse de votre première ou deuxième dose ou de votre dose de rappel. »

Parmi les 85 personnes hospitalisées, 81 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","18 New Hospital Admissions, 11 Discharges, Three Deaths","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--18 New Hospital Admissions, 11 Discharges, Three Deaths 
------------------------------------------------------
Today, January 20, Nova Scotia is reporting 18 new hospital admissions and 11 discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting three deaths related to COVID-19:
-- a woman in her 50s in Central Zone
-- a woman in her 70s in Northern Zone
-- a man in his 70s in Eastern Zone.

“This virus has taken three more Nova Scotians, and I’m devastated for the families and friends they are leaving behind,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Everyone needs to take the Omicron wave seriously and work together to protect our most vulnerable Nova Scotians, our healthcare system and communities.”

There are 85 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 12 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 0-100 years old. The average age is 68 and the average length of stay of people admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.8 days.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the three people who passed away,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The Omicron wave is different than those we encountered over the last two years, but there is no question that the virus is having very severe impacts on some people. Please do your part to prevent another loss. Follow restrictions and get your vaccine – whether it’s your first, second or booster dose.”

Of the 85 people in hospital, 81 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 10 (11.8 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 53 (62.4 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 4 (4.7 per cent) are partially vaccinated
-- 18 (21.2 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 72 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 112 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of January 19, 1,998,064 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 90.7 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 83.2 per cent have received their second dose.

As well, 40.6 per cent of Nova Scotians 18 and older have received a booster dose and 9.8 per cent have booked a booster dose appointment. 

Cases and Testing:

On January 19, Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) labs completed 4,402 tests. An additional 696 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being reported.

There are 382 cases in Central Zone, 95 cases in Eastern Zone, 63 cases in Northern Zone and 156 cases in Western Zone.

As of today, there are an estimated 5,430 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Hospital and Long-Term Care Outbreaks:

The NSHA is reporting additional cases related to the outbreaks in two hospitals: 
-- three additional patients in a ward at Cape Breton Regional Hospital; fewer than 10 patients have tested positive
-- one additional patient in a ward at Valley Regional Hospital; fewer than 10 patients have tested positive.

The Province is reporting one outbreak in a long-term care facility: one staff and one resident at Taigh Na Mara in Glace Bay.

"Environment and Climate Change","New Funding to Protect More Land","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--New Funding to Protect More Land
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Province, conservation organizations and other partners will receive an additional $1.5 million to protect more natural areas in Nova Scotia, through the federal government’s Canada Nature Fund Target 1 Challenge fund. 
 
The Province will distribute the funding to the following organizations for land protection projects: 
-- Nova Scotia Nature Trust
-- Nature Conservancy of Canada
-- Ducks Unlimited
-- Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources
-- The Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq
-- Sespite'tmnej Kmitkinu Conservancy
-- Eskasoni Fish and Wildlife Commission, and 
-- Municipality of the County of Cumberland. 
 
“Through the Challenge Fund partnership, conservation organizations, the Mi’kmaq and governments are working together to protect more of the land and waters that Nova Scotians depend on and want protected,” said Tim Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Our government has committed to protecting 20 per cent of our land and water by 2030. I want to thank our partners for their leadership and vision in helping to achieve this goal through their conservation work – work that is improving quality of life for Nova Scotians, helping to protect species at risk and fight climate change, and contributing to a healthy and sustainable environment.” 

The Nova Scotia Nature Trust, which has a mandate to protect Nova Scotia’s outstanding natural legacy through conservation of privately owned land, has used previous funding from this program to buy 40 hectares of land at Plaister Cliffs in the UNESCO Bras d’Or Lake Biosphere Reserve. It connects two parcels of land in the provincially protected MacAulay’s Hill Nature Reserve and is home to a rare and fragile karst landscape that includes rock formations and drainage systems considered threatened in Nova Scotia, and rare in North America and globally. 

The Province can also use the federal funding to buy land to be protected. Nova Scotia received $14.3 million in January 2020 from the Target 1 Challenge fund and used about $1.2 million to buy about 526 hectares (1,300 acres) of land, which will eventually become parts of nature reserves, wilderness areas, provincial parks or other protected areas. These include:
-- 119 hectares (295 acres), Truemanville, Cumberland County
-- 100 hectares (248 acres), Forchu, Richmond County
-- 99 hectares (245 acres), Bear River, Digby County
-- 60 hectares (148 acres), Marshy Hope, Antigonish County
-- 40 hectares (100 acres), Rawdon Gold Mines, Hants County
-- 40 hectares (100 acres), Carrigan Lake, Queens County
-- 40 hectares (100 acres), Glen Bard, Antigonish County
-- 23 hectares (58 acres), Mulcuish Lake, Richmond County.

Quotes: 
“This top-up of federal funding for Nova Scotia through the Canada Nature Fund will help protect even more of our beloved natural spaces and species at risk. It is through collaboration that we continue to make progress toward our goal of conserving 25 per cent of the land and oceans in Canada by 2025, building a healthy future and strong economy for generations to come.”
     - Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada

“Land conservation is critical in ensuring that the nature available to us today is there for future generations. The Challenge Fund partnership demonstrates not only the Province's commitment to continue advancing nature conservation but also is a truly ground-breaking collaboration between all levels of government, communities, Mi’kmaw organizations and land trusts. Nature needs us all to move faster, and we're honoured to be part of this initiative making that possible.”
     - Bonnie Sutherland, Executive Director, Nova Scotia Nature Trust.

Quick Facts:
-- the Government of Canada has committed to conserve 25 per cent of the lands and oceans in Canada by 2025, and to work toward 30 per cent by 2030
-- as part of the Canada Nature Fund, the Target 1 Challenge will help establish new protected and conserved areas across Canada, supporting the conservation of Canada’s ecosystems, landscapes and biodiversity, including species at risk
-- the additional funding announced today, January 20, must be spent by March 31, 2023

-------------------------------------------------------
L’adoption peut être un sujet délicat et chargé d’émotions. Les personnes adoptées ou les parents biologiques peuvent vouloir déterminer comment leurs renseignements identificatoires sont communiqués ou peuvent vouloir protéger les renseignements contenus dans leur dossier d’adoption.

Pour aider les gens à protéger ou à gérer leur renseignements confidentiels, il existe maintenant un nouveau portail Web où l’on peut remplir un veto à la divulgation et un avis sur la prise de contact et les déposer auprès du Programme de divulgation de la Province. Le site Web contient aussi des versions imprimables des formulaires que l’on peut télécharger, remplir et envoyer par courriel ou par la poste.

« Nous voulons que les gens qui veulent protéger leur vie privée ait un choix quant à l’utilisation des outils de protection de la vie privée, a souligné Karla MacFarlane, ministre des Services communautaires. Puisque c’est une question très personnelle et chargée d’émotions, les employés du Programme de divulgation sont aussi à la disposition des personnes visées par les nouvelles mesures législatives afin de discuter les options. J’encourage les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à joindre le programme s’ils ont des questions ou des inquiétudes, ou s’ils souhaitent simplement en parler. »

Un veto à la divulgation est un document qui indique qu'une personne adoptée ou un parent biologique ne souhaite pas que l'on divulgue des renseignements qui permettraient de l’identifier. Un avis sur la prise de contact permet aux gens de divulguer des renseignements identificatoires et également d'établir des paramètres sur la prise de contact, soit la façon dont on peut communiquer avec eux ou s'ils ne souhaitent pas qu'on communique avec eux.

Les nouvelles mesures législatives qui entrent en vigueur ce printemps permettront aux enfants adoptés, une fois qu’ils ont 19 ans, et aux parents biologiques d’avoir accès aux renseignements sur l’adoption s’ils le souhaitent. Le changement s’appliquera à tous les dossiers d’adoption. Il est important de noter qu’en vertu de ces nouvelles mesures législatives, les personnes qui avaient déjà demandé que leurs renseignements soient confidentiels doivent quand même remplir un outil de protection des renseignements personnels.

Citation
 « Nous sommes enthousiasmés par le potentiel de l’outil en ligne de divulgation de renseignements sur les adoptions.  Il donnera aux personnes adoptées, aux parents biologiques et aux familles touchés par une adoption un autre moyen d’avoir accès à des renseignements importants. Nous sommes toujours ravis des mesures prises pour moderniser le système de divulgation des renseignements sur les adoptions en Nouvelle-Écosse et cette démarche aura des répercussions positives pour beaucoup de gens. »

"Community Services","New Adoption Records Privacy Tool Now Available","COMMUNITY SERVICES--New Adoption Records Privacy Tool Now Available
----------------------------------------------------
Adoptions can be an emotional, sensitive issue. People who have been adopted or birth parents may want to control how their identifying information is shared or may wish to protect their adoption record information.

To help people protect or control their private information, a new web portal is now available for filling out disclosure vetoes and contact notices with the Province’s Disclosure Program. The website also has printable versions of the forms to download, fill out and send through email or regular mail.

“We want people who wish to protect their privacy to have a choice of how they use the privacy tools,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “Recognizing that this is a deeply personal and emotional matter, Disclosure Program staff are also available to discuss options with anyone impacted by the new legislation. I encourage Nova Scotians to reach out with questions or concerns or just to talk it through.”

A disclosure veto is a document stating an adopted person or a birth parent does not wish to share information that can identify them. A contact notice lets people share information that can identify them and set parameters around if or how they choose to be contacted.

New legislation that takes effect this spring will allow adopted children, once they turn 19, and birth parents to access adoption information if they want to. The change will apply to all adoption records. It is important to note that under the new legislation, people who have previously indicated they want to keep their information private are still required to fill out a privacy tool.

Quotes:
 “We are excited about the potential of the online adoption disclosure tool. This will give adoptees, birth parents and families impacted by adoption another avenue to access important information. We continue to be excited about the steps taken to modernize the disclosure system here in Nova Scotia and this will have a positive impact on many people.”

----------------------------------------------------------
On demande aux travailleurs de la santé qui ne font pas partie de la population active à l'heure actuelle de pourvoir à des postes dans les établissements de soins de longue durée en raison des pénuries de main-d'oeuvre causée par la pandémie de COVID-19 et les postes vacants.

« Nos employés ont fait un travail incroyable et de grands sacrifices au cours des 20 derniers mois, affirme Barbara Adams, ministre des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée. Ils méritent plus que notre respect. Ils méritent un répit des heures supplémentaires et des congés annulés, et nos proches méritent de recevoir des soins de personnes qui ne sont pas poussés au-delà de leurs capacités pour offrir des soins. »

Des postes temporaires à court et à long termes sont à pourvoir maintenant. 

L'organisme Health Association Nova Scotia fait partenariat avec le ministère des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée pour recruter des gens qui disposent des compétences et de la formation nécessaires et qui sont à la retraite ou qui ne travaillent pas actuellement dans le secteur, ainsi que des gens qui travaillent à temps partiel qui souhaitent travailler à temps plein de façon temporaire.
 
Les établissements de soins de longue durée partout dans la province ont besoin de travailleurs de la santé, y compris des auxiliaires en soins continus, des infirmières autorisées, des infirmières auxiliaires autorisées, des ergothérapeutes et des physiothérapeutes. 

Health Association Nova Scotia coordonne les efforts au nom des établissements et du gouvernement. Pour en savoir plus et pour présenter une demande d'emploi, consultez le http://www.healthassociation.ns.ca/sites/base/pages/continuingcarerecruitment (en anglais seulement) . Chaque personne qui présente une demande recevra un appel de suivi de l'organisme. 

Faits en bref
-- Les postes à court terme sont financés grâce aux postes actuellement vacants dans le système des soins continus. 
-- Les efforts de recrutement de nouveaux employés et d'appui aux employés actuels sont financés dans le cadre d'une stratégie générale de 57 millions de dollars visant à trouver des solutions et à renforcer la main-d'oeuvre dans le secteur des soins continus.

"Public Works","Upgrades to Legislative TV Control Room","PUBLIC WORKS--Upgrades to Legislative TV Control Room
-------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing $1.9 million to renovate the Legislative TV Control Room in Province House.  

The control room provides audio and video services for House of Assembly sessions, press conferences, meetings and official record keeping for the Nova Scotia Legislature.

“Our provincial legislature is the heart of our democratic process where laws are debated and passed, spending decisions are made and where Nova Scotia’s elected officials represent the voice of their constituents,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “These upgrades will help ensure Province House is accessible and transparent to all Nova Scotians.”

The upgrades include:
-- a new expanded control room that meets accessibility requirements for barrier-free access
-- upgrades to the electrical and mechanical ventilation system, soundproofing and a new air-conditioning unit for climate-control of equipment
-- upgrades to the audio and video equipment that will allow the capability to broadcast Main Chamber and Red Chamber sessions simultaneously; currently only one can be broadcast at a time.

A tender for the control room renovations will be issued soon. The renovations are expected to be completed this spring.

Quick Facts:
-- the existing control room was installed about 25 years ago and does not meet current accessibility standards 
-- the Province’s accessibility strategy, Access by Design 2030, outlines how to achieve an accessible province by 2030 by providing persons with disabilities with equitable access to programs, services, information and infrastructure

Nous sommes heureux que 23 nouveaux postes de services d’aide à l’emploi viennent s’ajouter à l’effectif actuel pour contribuer à la prestation de services au Cap-Breton et pour aider les gens de cette région dans leurs efforts pour acquérir des compétences et profiter des occasions d’emploi. »

People in Arichat, Chéticamp, Inverness, Port Hawkesbury, St. Peter’s and Sydney will have access to their services online or in person starting this month, about three months earlier than expected.

“In looking for new, permanent providers to fill a gap left by a service provider’s closure, we were committed to making sure that employment services and funding remained in Cape Breton,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “We’re pleased that an additional 23 employment service positions will be added to support the delivery of services in Cape Breton and further support Cape Bretoners as they acquire skills and connect with job opportunities.”

The YMCA Cape Breton and CDÉNÉ were the successful applicants to an expression of interest issued by the Department in October. The criteria used to select the new providers included:
-- in-depth knowledge of the labour market in Cape Breton

Our centres also provide services to support businesses in recruiting, managing and developing the talent they require to be more productive in the local economy. At its very core, the YMCA as an organization is committed to building healthy communities through the power of belonging. With this expansion of services, Port Hawkesbury, Inverness and St. Peter’s employment centres now belong to the YMCA Cape Breton family of Nova Scotia Works Centres along with our existing centres in Sydney, Glace Bay and New Waterford.”

Aujourd'hui 18 janvier, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que 13 personnes supplémentaires ont été hospitalisées et 8 personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital.

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également un décès lié à la COVID-19. Une octogénaire est décédée dans le secteur de l'est. 

« C'est une autre triste journée, et je transmets mes condoléances à la famille et aux proches de la dame qui est décédée, souligne le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous devons vraiment nous retrousser les manches et faire le nécessaire pour protéger notre système de soins de santé, nos établissements de soins de longue durée et nos communautés contre la COVID-19. Il faut donc ralentir nos activités, réduire nos contacts, se faire vacciner et obtenir sa dose de rappel dès que possible, puis respecter toutes les mesures sanitaires. » 

À l'heure actuelle, 73 personnes ayant contracté la COVID-19 sont hospitalisées et reçoivent des soins spécialisés dans des unités particulières. De ce nombre, 15 sont aux soins intensifs. Les personnes hospitalisées sont âgées de 0 à 100 ans, et l'âge moyen est de 68 ans. La durée moyenne du séjour à l'hôpital est de 6,4 jours.

Parmi les 73 personnes hospitalisées, 70 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron.

J'offre mes prières et mes condoléances à la famille et aux proches de la dame qui est décédée, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Chaque vie perdue est un rappel que la COVID-19 persiste et constitue une menace réelle. Je suis désolé d'apprendre qu'une autre famille pleure la perte d'un être cher avant son temps. » 

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 10 (13,7 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 43 (58,9 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, January 18, Nova Scotia is reporting 13 new hospital admissions and eight discharges.

Nova Scotia is also reporting one death related to COVID-19. A woman in her 80s in Eastern Zone has died. 

“This is another very sad day and I send my sympathies to the family and loved ones of the woman who has passed,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Now is the time to buckle down. I ask all Nova Scotians to do everything you can to keep COVID-19 out of our healthcare system, long-term care facilities and our communities. This means slowing down activities, reducing contacts, getting vaccinated and getting your booster as soon as possible and following all of the public health measures.” 

There are 73 people in hospital who were admitted due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a COVID-19 designated unit. That includes 15 people in ICU. The age range of those in hospital is 0-100 years old, the average age is 68 and the average length of stay of those admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 6.4 days.

Of the 73 people in hospital, 70 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

“Today, we lost another Nova Scotian to this virus, and I offer my prayers and condolences to the family and loved ones of the woman who passed,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Every person we lose is a reminder that COVID-19 persists as a very real threat. It hurts me to know that another family is grieving the loss of a loved one before their time.” 

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:

-- 43 (58.9 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 4 (5.5 per cent) are partially vaccinated
-- 16 (21.9 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that less than 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated.

There are also two other groups of people in hospital related to COVID-19:
-- 63 people who were identified as positive upon arrival at hospital but were admitted for another medical reason, or were admitted for COVID-19 but no longer require specialized care
-- 120 people who contracted COVID-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Vaccine Coverage:

As of January 17, 1,963,429 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 90.6 per cent of Nova Scotians have received their first dose, and 83.1 per cent have received their second dose.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia will invest nearly $500 million in capital spending on its highways, bridges and roads in 2022-23.

The Five-Year Highway Improvement Plan includes more than 150 major construction and improvement projects for the coming year that will make Nova Scotia’s roads, highways and bridges safer.

“Transportation is critical to ensure safe and connected communities and that’s why we are making one of the largest investments in Nova Scotia’s infrastructure in provincial history,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “The plan annualizes the additional $20 million in support for gravel roads we announced last fall.”

Ten major construction projects are planned for 2022-23 with the focus on ongoing twinning of Highways 101, 103, 104 and 107, as well as the Aerotech Connector on Highway 102, the Bridgewater interchange on Highway 103 and continued work to convert the Port Hastings rotary to a roundabout.

The 2022-23 plan includes the construction of 12 new bridges and the replacement of 18 bridges.

Quick Facts:
-- the plan maps out the government’s approach, year by year, to repair and maintain the province’s 23,000 kilometres of roads and highways and 4,100 bridges 
-- 565 kilometres of road were paved in 2021-2022 and work completed on more than 315 kilometres of gravel roads

"Nova Scotia Business Inc.","Cognizant Chooses Nova Scotia for Expansion, Expects to Create up to 1,250 Jobs","NOVA SCOTIA BUSINESS INC.--Cognizant Chooses Nova Scotia for Expansion, Expects to Create up to 1,250 Jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Global technology services company Cognizant has chosen Nova Scotia for its expansion plans, helping to advance the Province’s goals of attracting new economic opportunities, increasing the population and helping Nova Scotians access better paying jobs.

Over the next seven years, up to 1,250 new jobs are anticipated from two payroll rebate agreements approved by the Province for Cognizant, one of the world’s leading technology and professional services companies. 

“We have a bold plan for economic growth in Nova Scotia, and a thriving ICT sector is part of our way forward,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development and Minister responsible for Nova Scotia Business Inc. (NSBI). “This is an exciting opportunity, and we are thrilled to have Cognizant expanding to Nova Scotia, bringing with it more high-quality opportunities, which will add to our increasingly diverse and skilled workforce.”

Cognizant will establish a new global technology and service delivery centre in Halifax, where it will employ a range of technology professionals and business process outsourcing employees.

During the term of the agreements, the company could spend an estimated $327 million in combined salaries and benefits – the highest amount through payroll rebate agreements with one company in more than a decade. The Province would collect income and consumption taxes from that payroll spending and could return a maximum rebate of about $27 million to Cognizant. The company will be eligible for a smaller amount if it creates fewer than 1,250 jobs.

A key priority for the government, as identified in Ministers’ mandate letters, is economic growth. The Province will work to double Nova Scotia’s population, encourage innovative, sustainable and green businesses to establish or relocate to the Province, and provide access to financing for innovative, sustainable and green business startups.

Quotes:
“We chose Halifax as our next expansion location in Canada to support our growing number of clients, and we look forward to contributing to the region’s vibrant technology community. We are pleased to be supporting the growth of the region with the creation of new employment opportunities and are grateful to the Province for their partnership and support of Cognizant expanding in Nova Scotia.”
     - Jay MacIsaac, Country Head Delivery Centres – Canada, Cognizant

“As the Province’s lead business development agency, NSBI is both a partner and a connector with the broader private-sector, academia and public-sector worlds, helping our province continue raising awareness, growing exports, and attracting foreign direct investment like that of Cognizant. The ICT sector has grown to become an integral component of the Nova Scotia economy, and it’s one of NSBI’s strategic sectors.”
     - Laurel Broten, President and CEO, Nova Scotia Business Inc.

“The teams at Digital Nova Scotia and NSBI work on a regular basis to help foster technology talent and encourage and support businesses looking to establish a presence in our province. The tech sector is rapidly growing and many graduates, new Nova Scotians and seasoned experts are advancing their careers here.”
     - Wayne Sumarah, CEO, Digital Nova Scotia

“This is a pivotal moment for the digital ecosystem in the province as an increasing number of organizations choose to open or start here and computer science education expands. In the faculty of computer science at Dalhousie, we have more than 2,100 students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs with ambitious plans to grow those numbers and research capacity. We recently launched the Here We Code campaign, showcasing what Nova Scotia has to offer in this space, and we are excited to welcome Cognizant to further enhance our provincial success story.”
     - Andrew Rau-Chaplin, Dean, Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University

Quick Facts:
-- NSBI, a Crown corporation led by a private-sector board of directors, is the Province’s business development agency 
-- these payroll rebates were pre-authorized through NSBI’s board and received final approval by executive council (the provincial cabinet) 
-- payroll rebates are designed in a way that the tax revenue generated for the Province by the new jobs is always more than the amount spent on the rebate and are only paid after a business has generated actual payroll for the Nova Scotia economy
-- in 2021, the Province invested $16.8 million to allow four Nova Scotia universities to expand and enhance their computer science programming as the demand for training continues to grow
-- Nova Scotia’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector has contributed $1.8 billion, or four per cent, of provincial GDP in 2020 and directly employed 11,000 people through 1,300 companies

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing $37.3 million from the Green Fund in projects that support the goals of the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This includes $15 million over three years for the Sustainable Communities Challenge Fund, which will support communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A request for proposals to develop and administer the fund was issued today, January 17.

“Climate change impacts every Nova Scotian in every community across this province,” said Environment and Climate Change Minister Tim Halman. “To achieve our targets, we need to support the type of transformative change required to adapt to a rapidly changing climate.”

Other projects include:
-- $8 million for the SolarHomes incentive program for single-family homes to install solar photovoltaic systems
-- $8 million to extend for one year the Home Energy Assessment program, which provides low-cost subsidized energy assessments for people using oil heating and incentives of up to $5,000 to energy efficiency retrofits
-- $3.3 million over three years to support the implementation of climate change initiatives by the Department of Environment and Climate Change
-- $2 million for affordable housing retrofits to upgrade one- and two-unit housing units in Cape Breton; the Department of Municipal Affairs and Housing is also contributing $2 million for a total of $4 million
-- $1 million for flood line mapping to provide communities with coastal and inland floodplain maps that incorporate climate change.

Quotes:
“Flood line mapping is imperative to the planning that is needed to build environmentally resilient communities. Pairing green technology and efficiency solutions with affordable housing is the bold action needed to ensure we provide safe and climate-friendly housing that is future minded. Providing a forum for residents and organizations to develop and implement innovative green solutions allows for community-led solutions that will make significant impacts in all corners of the province.”
     - Amanda MacDougall, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities

“The climate crisis is impacting all Nova Scotians and it’s clear that we need to act urgently. Nova Scotians have embraced solar technology and we’ve provided rebates on nearly 5,000 systems. Continued investments in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction will allow us to focus our efforts in areas that will have the greatest impact on the environment and the economy, and respond to the needs of Nova Scotians.”
     - Stephen MacDonald, President and CEO of EfficiencyOne, the non-profit operator of Efficiency Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- the objective of the Sustainable Communities Challenge Fund is to help reach greenhouse gas emission targets in 2030 and 2050 and improve the province’s capacity to adapt to climate change
-- the Green Fund is revenue collected under the Province’s cap and trade program
-- companies in the program that do not reduce their greenhouse gas emissions must buy allowances at auction, with that money set aside to be reinvested in climate change initiatives
-- auctions in 2021 raised $44.3 million

"African Nova Scotian Affairs","New Regional Offices Increase Support for African Nova Scotian Communities","AFRICAN NOVA SCOTIAN AFFAIRS--New Regional Offices Increase Support for African Nova Scotian Communities
----------------------------------------------------------------
Three new regional offices will give African Nova Scotian communities across the province increased access to government support, programs and services.

The Province announced today, January 17, the establishment of new African Nova Scotian Affairs regional offices in Digby, New Glasgow, and the Preston area.

“We’ve heard loud and clear that rural African Nova Scotian communities have unique needs and concerns, and they need greater access to supports and services,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs. “This is a step to make sure we’re serving African Nova Scotian communities from one end of the province to the other.”

The hiring process to support the regional offices will begin soon, and the offices are expected to open in the coming weeks.

“Access is paramount if we are to strengthen our support to African Nova Scotian communities,” said Dwayne Provo, Associate Deputy Minister of African Nova Scotian Affairs.

Quotes:
“Having an African Nova Scotian Affairs Digby regional office will not only help provide additional services to our community, but further address the unique needs of African Nova Scotians in our rural area.”
     - Lelia Barton, Chairperson, Digby Education Committee

“We are excited that African Nova Scotian Affairs is expanding to the Town of New Glasgow.  This will allow our communities to share more ideas, projects and programs, and opportunities to access services.”
     - Myla Borden, member of the Ward 1 Social and Recreation Centre, New Glasgow

“The North Preston, East Preston, Cherry Brook and Lake Loon area constitutes the largest historic Black community in Canada. It is fundamental that we have a dedicated African Nova Scotian Affairs support staff to help support the community’s needs. This is a welcome step.”
     - Dr. Carolyn Thomas, Owner and Operator, Black Heritage Tours Inc.

Quick Facts:
-- the Digby office will serve the Digby-Annapolis-Kings region while the New Glasgow office will serve Pictou, Antigonish and Guysborough counties
-- African Nova Scotian Affairs also has offices in Yarmouth, serving southwest Nova Scotia; Truro, serving the Colchester-Cumberland region; and Sydney, serving Cape Breton Regional Municipality

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Doses de rappel pour les 18 ans et plus, ajout de rendez-vous pour le vaccin de Pfizer","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Doses de rappel pour les 18 ans et plus, ajout de rendez-vous pour le vaccin de Pfizer
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
La Province offre maintenant la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 à toute personne de 18 ans ou plus. 

Les doses de rappel sont administrées au moins 168 jours après la série principale de vaccins. Les gens qui ont reçu deux doses du vaccin d'AstraZeneca ou le vaccin Janssen à une dose sont toujours admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel d'un vaccin à base d'ARNm.

En outre, plus de 55 000 rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer contre la COVID-19 seront ajoutés dans les cliniques à l'échelle de la province. Ces rendez-vous seront offerts seulement aux personnes de 12 à 29 ans pour l'instant, et pourront être pris à compter d'aujourd'hui 17 janvier.

Les personnes de 12 à 17 ans peuvent seulement prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer à titre de première ou de deuxième dose. Ce groupe d'âge n'est pas encore admissible à une dose de rappel.

On encourage fortement les personnes de 18 à 29 ans à prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer à titre de deuxième dose ou de dose de rappel, en raison du risque rare mais accru de myocardite et de péricardite chez les jeunes adultes après l'administration du vaccin de Moderna comparativement au vaccin de Pfizer.

Les rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer seront offerts aux personnes de 30 ans ou plus lorsque les gens de 12 à 29 ans auront eu la chance de fixer leur rendez-vous. On encourage les gens de 30 ans ou plus qui ont déjà pris rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Moderna contre la COVID-19 à garder ce rendez-vous afin de recevoir leur dose de rappel plus rapidement et de réduire le gaspillage des vaccins.

Toute personne admissible à recevoir le vaccin contre la COVID-19 peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou en composant le numéro sans frais 1-833-797-7772.

Faits en bref
-- Il y a environ 651 000 personnes de 18 ans et plus en Nouvelle-Écosse qui sont admissibles à la dose de rappel.

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
The Province has expanded eligibility for COVID-19 booster doses to include anyone 18 years of age and older. 

Booster doses are administered at least 168 days after the primary series. People who received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine or the one-dose Janssen vaccine are still eligible to schedule a booster dose of mRNA vaccine.

As well, more than 55,000 appointments for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine will be added at clinics across the province. These appointments are available only to people 12 to 29 years of age at this time, and they will be open for booking starting today, January 17.

People 12 to 17 can only schedule a Pfizer vaccine for their first or second dose. This age group is not eligible for a booster dose.

People 18 to 29 are strongly encouraged to schedule a Pfizer vaccine for their first, second or booster dose as recent evidence shows there is a rare, but increased risk of myocarditis/pericarditis in young adults from Moderna vaccine as compared to Pfizer vaccine.

Pfizer appointments will reopen to people 30 and older after the 12-29 age group has the chance to book. People 30 and older who have scheduled a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine appointment are encouraged to keep their appointment so they can receive their booster sooner and to reduce vaccine wastage.

Anyone eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine can schedule an appointment online at https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling the toll-free line: 1-833-797-7772.

Quick Facts:
-- there are about 651,000 Nova Scotians age 18 and older who are eligible to schedule a booster dose

"Premier's Office","Premier Pays Tribute to Alexa McDonough","Premier Tim Houston paid tribute today, January 15, to the remarkable life and legacy of Alexa McDonough.  The former NDP leader died today, at the age of 77.

“Alexa McDonough was a trailblazer whose name will be mentioned in the same breath as Agnes MacPhail and Gladys Porter,” Premier Houston said. “When she became the leader of the Nova Scotia NDP, she made history as the first woman to lead a major political party in Canada.”

McDonough served in the Nova Scotia Legislature from 1981 until 1994. She was elected leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 1995. She stepped down as party leader in 2003, but continued to serve as a member of Parliament for two more terms, until 2008.

She was an Officer of the Order of Canada and a member of the Order of Nova Scotia.

“The hallmark of Ms. McDonough’s long career was her respect for the people she represented,” said Premier Houston. “She was a public servant in the truest sense and she will be sorely missed by people across Canada.”

Premier Houston sends his deepest condolences to Ms. McDonough’s family and many friends.

"Justice","Changes to Provincial Judicial Appointments Guidelines","JUSTICE--Changes to Provincial Judicial Appointments Guidelines
----------------------------------------------------------------
The government is taking measures to improve the process for appointing judges to the province’s criminal and family courts.

Amended guidelines, effective today, January 14, will change the structure of the advisory committee, the body that assesses and recommends candidates to the minister of justice for judicial appointments. 

“The appointment of judges to the provincial and family courts is one of the most important decisions government has to make so it’s absolutely crucial that we have a robust process in place. These new changes make an already good process better,” said Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice.

The changes include adding a retired member of the judiciary to the advisory committee to act as chair. The amendments will also permit the minister to request more information about candidates applying to become judges. There will also be a requirement for Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society members who sit on the committee to be representative of the Nova Scotia legal community, which will help increase diversity on the advisory committee. 

The new guidelines will help ensure a more transparent, fair and accountable process for appointing provincial judges. 

Key changes include:
-- the justice minister will appoint two members from a list of six lawyers identified by the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society, and one judge from a list of four full-time sitting provincial and/or family court judges identified by the chief judge
-- the committee will be chaired by a retired member of the judiciary
-- upon request, the committee will provide additional information to the minister of justice that explains and supports its recommendations
-- candidates will demonstrate sensitivity to cultural diversity
-- staggered two-year terms for committee members.

Diversity, including individuals from Indigenous, racial and ethnocultural backgrounds, persons with disabilities, geography and gender balance, remain criteria for appointment to the advisory committee.

The guidelines will continue to ensure that appointments to the bench are based on merit and professional excellence, the highest consideration when appointing judges.

A new advisory committee will be appointed in the coming weeks and qualified lawyers interested in becoming judges will be invited to submit or re-submit their applications. 

“I want to thank the outgoing committee members for their excellent work and service. I look forward to appointing a new committee soon,” said Minister Johns. 

Quick Facts:
-- the Provincial Judicial Appointments Guidelines have been in place since 1995 and were last amended in 2016; at that time, the years of experience in the legal profession required to apply to be a judge were reduced from 15 to 10 years
-- the advisory committee is currently composed of two members appointed by the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, the chief judge of the provincial court or designate, chief judge of the family court or designate and four members appointed by the minister of justice, two of which must be non-lawyer members representative of the public

"Premier's Office / Education and Early Childhood Development","La Province réduit les frais de garde d'enfant de 25 %","BUREAU DU PREMIER MINISTRE/ÉDUCATION ET DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA PETITE ENFANCE--La Province réduit les frais de garde d'enfant de 25 %
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Les parents et les parents-substituts profitent d'une réduction précoce des frais de garde d'enfants alors que la Province accélère son engagement à réduire ces frais en vertu de l'Entente pour l'apprentissage et la garde de jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada.

L'Entente prévoit une réduction moyenne de 50 % des frais d'ici la fin de cette année. Il y aura une réduction initiale moyenne de 25 %, rétroactive au 1er janvier 2022, ce qui permettra aux parents et aux parents-substituts d'économiser en moyenne 200 $ par mois pour un tout-petit en service de garde.

« Cette réduction de 25 % des frais de garde d'enfants aura un impact réel sur les familles et les parents-substituts de jeunes enfants, et sur les gens qui envisagent de fonder une famille, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Le coût peut être un obstacle à l'accès à des services de garde d'enfants de qualité et pourrait empêcher les parents de s'intégrer au marché du travail ou de le réintégrer.  Le fait de réduire les frais maintenant offre un répit en attendant d'atteindre la réduction moyenne de 50 % des frais d'ici la fin de l'année. »

Les parents continueront de payer les frais actuels jusqu'au 1er avril, puis ils pourront choisir de recevoir un remboursement de la différence pour les frais payés de janvier à mars ou un crédit. Ensuite, les parents paieront le tarif réduit aux centres qui se sont joints au système pancanadien d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants.

En vertu de l'Entente pancanadienne, les tarifs des services agréés de garde d'enfants seront réduits à 10 $ par jour, en moyenne, d'ici au 31 mars 2026.

En plus de la réduction des frais, 1 500 nouvelles places seront ajoutées dans des centres de garde d'enfants à but non lucratif à compter de l'automne, dans le cadre du plan visant à ajouter 9 500 nouvelles places dans les centres d'apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants d'ici au 31 mars 2026. Les nouvelles places seront offertes dans un plus grand nombre de collectivités à l'échelle de la Nouvelle-Écosse, dans le but d'offrir un accès équitable à des services abordables et accessibles de garde d'enfants partout dans la province. Les collectivités où les options pour la garde d'enfants sont limitées auront bientôt accès à des services agréés de garde d'enfants pour les nourrissons et les tout-petits, en plus des programmes de garde avant et après l'école.

En plus d'ajouter de nouvelles places dans les centres de garde d'enfants, le gouvernement poursuivra la mise en oeuvre de la Stratégie sur la main-d'oeuvre intitulée « Excellence en éducation de la petite enfance », qui offrira une meilleure rémunération pour les éducateurs et éducatrices de la petite enfance, ainsi que l'élimination des frais de scolarité, des livres gratuits et des bourses pour des centaines de personnes qui suivent les cours en matière d'éducation à la petite enfance.

« En plus d'offrir l'important avantage des services de garde d'enfants abordables, la participation à cette Entente signifie également un salaire et des avantages améliorés pour des centaines d'éducateurs et éducatrices de la petite enfance, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Nous allons créer des centaines d'emplois tout en offrant un plus grand nombre de places dans les centres de garde d'enfants à l'échelle de la province. Le salaire et les avantages améliorés permettront de maintenir en poste les excellentes éducatrices de la petite enfance que nous avons, et d'en attirer encore davantage. »

Le gouvernement du Canada offre un investissement transformateur visant à bâtir un système d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants à l'échelle du Canada en collaboration avec ses partenaires provinciaux, territoriaux et autochtones. Cela inclut un investissement fédéral historique de 605 millions de dollars pour la Nouvelle-Écosse de 2021-2022 à 2025-2026, en plus d'un investissement ponctuel d'environ 10,9 millions de dollars en 2021-2022 à l'appui de la main-d'oeuvre néo-écossaise dans le domaine de la petite enfance. 

L'objectif est de réduire les tarifs des services agréés de garde d'enfant à 10 $ par jour, en moyenne, à l'échelle du Canada au cours des cinq prochaines années. D'ici la fin de l'année 2022, le gouvernement du Canada vise à réduire de 50 % les tarifs moyens des services agréés d'apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants afin de rendre ces services plus abordables pour les familles.  Le financement à l'intention de la main-d'oeuvre du domaine de la petite enfance appuie des initiatives qui mettent l'accent sur le recrutement, le maintien en poste et le perfectionnement professionnel.

L'accès à des services d'apprentissage précoce de qualité supérieure pour mes enfants a été essentiel pour l'équilibre de ma famille, et la réduction des frais est très significative pour les familles de toute la province. Je suis comblée du travail en cours visant à appuyer les éducateurs et éducatrices de la petite enfance qui travaillent sans relâche pour répondre aux besoins des jeunes enfants et pour leur offrir les bases nécessaires pour l'apprentissage continu. »

"Premier's Office / Education and Early Childhood Development","Province Moves to Reduce Child-Care Fees by 25 Per Cent","PREMIER’S OFFICE/EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Province Moves to Reduce Child-Care Fees by 25 Per Cent
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Parents and caregivers will see a reduction in child-care fees ahead of schedule as the Province accelerates its commitment to lower fees under the Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement.

The agreement calls for a 50 per cent reduction, on average, in fees by the end of this year. There will be an early initial decrease of 25 per cent, on average, retroactive to January 1, 2022, saving parents and caregivers an average of $200 a month for a toddler in child care.

“Reducing the cost of child care by 25 per cent will make a real difference for families and caregivers of young children and Nova Scotians thinking about starting a family,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Cost can be a barrier to accessing quality child care and may prevent parents from joining or rejoining the workforce. Acting now to reduce fees will help provide relief as we move toward a 50 per cent, on average, reduction in fees by the end of the year.”

Parents will continue to pay their current rate until April 1, when they will choose to receive either a cheque from their centre reflecting the reduction from January to March or a credit. Parents will then pay the reduced rate going forward through centres that have joined the Canada-wide early learning and child-care system.

Under the Canada-wide agreement, fees for regulated child-care will drop to $10 a day, on average, by March 31, 2026.

In addition to reduced fees, there will be 1,500 new not-for-profit child-care spaces beginning this fall, part of the plan for 9,500 new early learning and child-care spaces by March 31, 2026. The new spaces will be made available in more communities across Nova Scotia, with the goal of equitable access to affordable, accessible child care everywhere in the province. Communities with limited care options will soon have access to licensed child care for infants and toddlers, along with before and after school programs.

As the government works to add child-care spaces, it will also continue to implement Nova Scotia’s Excellence in Early Childhood Education workforce strategy, which will result in higher wages for early childhood educators and free tuition, books and bursaries for hundreds of people taking early childhood educator courses.

“Along with the huge benefit of affordable child care, participation in the Canada-wide agreement means increasing wages and benefits for hundreds of early childhood educators,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “We are creating hundreds of jobs and, at the same time, expanding child-care spaces across the province. Better pay and benefits will help keep the great early childhood educators we have and attract more people to the profession.”

The Government of Canada is making a transformative investment to build a Canada-wide early learning and child care system in partnership with provincial, territorial and Indigenous partners. This includes a historic federal investment of $605 million for Nova Scotia from 2021-2022 to 2025-2026, in addition to a one-time investment of about $10.9 million in 2021-2022 to support Nova Scotia’s early childhood workforce. 

The goal is to bring fees for regulated child care down to $10 per day on average across Canada within the next five years. By the end of 2022, the Government of Canada is aiming to reduce average fees for regulated early learning and child care by 50 per cent to make care more affordable for families.  Funding dedicated to the early childhood workforce supports initiatives that focus on recruitment, retention and professional development.

Quotes:
“All families should have access to affordable child care. That is why we’re making $10 a day child care a reality across the country. The reduction of fees announced today in Nova Scotia is an important step forward to delivering on our Canada-wide early learning and child care system, which will save families thousands of dollars each year, create jobs, grow the middle class, and give our kids the best start in life.”
     - Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada

“The Government of Canada’s goal is to ensure that in five years, all families in Canada, no matter where they live, will have access to regulated early learning and child care for an average of $10 a day. The reduction of fees announced today in Nova Scotia is a meaningful step toward achieving that goal and will make a real difference for families across the province. We will continue to work with Nova Scotia to help ensure that children have access to the high-quality, affordable, and inclusive early learning and child care they need to succeed.”
     - Karina Gould, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development

“As mom of two young children, a board member at a non-profit child-care centre and a researcher, I am so pleased to see the progress Nova Scotia is making toward the important vision of affordable, high-quality and inclusive early learning and child care. Access to high-quality early learning for our children has been essential in helping my family find balance and the fee reductions are so meaningful for families across the province. I am excited about the work underway to support early childhood educators, who work tirelessly to respond to the needs of young children and offer them the foundation for life-long learning.”
     - Jessie-Lee McIsaac, Assistant Professor and Tier II Canada Research Chair in Early Childhood: Diversity and Transitions, Mount Saint Vincent University

"Premier's Office / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Minimum Wage Review Committee Submits Annual Review","PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Minimum Wage Review Committee Submits Annual Review
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Minimum Wage Review Committee has submitted its report with recommendations on the minimum wage rate. The government will accept the recommended increase for April 1 and is seeking more stakeholder input before making a decision on the committee’s remaining recommendations.

“I am very grateful for the work of the Minimum Wage Review Committee and thank them for their recommendations,” said Premier Tim Houston. “The government has a role in setting a fair minimum wage rate and independent business owners have the option to set a competitive rate to attract and retain workers. I want to talk with the members of the committee and hear more from employees and businesses before taking action.”

The Minimum Wage Review Committee is made up of employee and employer representatives. The committee submitted its report to the Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration at the end of 2021. It included a recommendation that the minimum wage increase by 40 cents an hour to $13.35 on April 1, based on the national consumer price index (CPI). A second recommended adjustment on October 1 would bring the minimum wage to $13.60. The committee’s recommendations also include a path to a $15 minimum wage by 2024.

“The pandemic has caused economic challenges across all sectors in Nova Scotia. We need to ensure our economy can grow in a fair and balanced way, and that working Nova Scotians are paid a fair wage,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “As a new government, this is our first opportunity to identify solutions and set the minimum wage rate, taking into consideration the valued work of the Minimum Wage Review Committee. We are carefully considering their recommendations and I’d like to thank them for their work.”

The government plans to announce its decision on the rest of the recommendations after receiving additional input.

Quick Facts:
-- under the Labour Standards Code, the Minimum Wage Review Committee is mandated to conduct an annual review of the minimum wage in Nova Scotia
-- an average of 8.1 per cent of workers, or 31,400 Nova Scotians, worked for minimum wage during the period from April 2020 to March 2021; they worked primarily in retail trade, followed by food and accommodation industries

NOTE: The following is a news release on behalf of the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission has released a progress report on the Province’s efforts to address the urgent need for improved affordable housing in Nova Scotia.

The report reviews actions taken by the Province to implement the 17 recommendations and 60 meaningful actions that the commission submitted in its May 2021 report, Charting a New Course for Affordable Housing in Nova Scotia.

The commission noted that several key initiatives related to housing supply challenges have been successfully advanced. In particular, the commission highlighted the Province’s investment in four quick-start initiatives, and the introduction of legislative changes to improve renter protections and give municipalities more power to support affordable housing within their communities.

The Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission was formed in 2020 in response to the Province’s affordable housing crisis and was asked to develop recommendations that would improve access to affordable housing. The 17 members of the commission represent various sectors, regions and backgrounds.

The commission consulted with 36 experts and more than 2,000 Nova Scotians through an extensive public consultation process to form its recommendations.

Quotes:

"Nova Scotia Securities Commission","Investor Alert for CoinRise","NOVA SCOTIA SECURITIES COMMISSION--Investor Alert for CoinRise 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting Nova Scotians that CoinRise, operating online at www.coinrise.ca, is not registered to engage in the business of trading in securities or derivatives in Nova Scotia. 

CoinRise claims to be Canada’s fastest growing crypto trading platform. It also claims to offer wealth management and investment banking services, and to be located in Halifax.

At least one Nova Scotian has invested funds with CoinRise. While this investor’s account showed substantial gains on the principal investment, the investor was able to withdraw only a minimal amount of the reported returns and further withdrawal requests were ignored.

When opening the account, the investor was required to provide personal information including a driver’s licence, passport and credit card, risking financial loss and identity theft.

CoinRise has also been named in an investor alert from the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan. At that time, CoinRise claimed to be located in Regina. After the alert in December, CoinRise altered its stated location to Halifax.

The commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with firms that are not registered in Nova Scotia. People can contact their local securities regulator to report investment scams or what they believe to be suspicious behaviour from anyone offering investment opportunities.

Quotes:
“In addition to verifying registration, always take the time to search the internet for the entity and its representatives. The internet can be a dangerous place to shop for investments but can also be a valuable tool for avoiding financial loss. A simple online search can reveal alerts and warnings, complaints, reviews and other useful information to help investors make informed investment decisions.”
     - Stephanie Atkinson, Director of Enforcement, Nova Scotia Securities Commission

Quick Facts:
-- it is illegal to solicit investments in Nova Scotia without registering with the commission and complying with Nova Scotia securities laws, unless an exemption applies

Quotes: 
“With this grant, we will be able to complete capital projects that will improve the energy efficiency of the building, reduce operating costs, and ensure the longevity of the facility for years to come. The creation of our community room will provide much needed space for local groups to meet and socialize year-round.”

Quick Facts: 
-- the total amount of funding for the 33 projects is $978,483

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","29 nouvelles hospitalisations, 19 congés, 3 décès","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE-- 29 nouvelles hospitalisations, 3 décès
---------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 10 janvier, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale que 29 personnes ont été hospitalisées et 19 personnes ont reçu leur congé de l'hôpital depuis la dernière mise à jour le 7 janvier.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également trois décès liés à la COVID-19 :
-- un homme dans la soixantaine dans le secteur de l'est
-- un septuagénaire dans le secteur du nord
-- un octogénaire dans le secteur du centre

Ces trois personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 pendant la vague Omicron.

« La vague Omicron a emporté trois autres Néo-Écossais, et je suis attristé pour les proches de ces personnes, souligne le premier ministre Tim Houston. C'est exactement pourquoi des restrictions sont nécessaires. Elles ajoutent une protection supplémentaire pour les personnes les plus vulnérables à une maladie grave. Je vous prie de faire le nécessaire pour assurer la sécurité de votre famille, de vos amis et de vos communautés. »

À l'heure actuelle, 59 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 2 aux soins intensifs. Ces personnes sont âgées de 31 à 100 ans, et l'âge moyen est de 69 ans. Parmi les 59 personnes hospitalisées, 55 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron. 

« Je suis de tout coeur avec les familles et les amis des trois Néo-Écossais qui sont décédés, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Il n'y a aucun doute que cette vague est très différente, mais il n'y a également aucun doute que le virus peut avoir des effets graves chez certaines personnes. Nous sommes tous responsables de protéger les gens qui nous entourent et notre système de soins de santé. Respectez les restrictions et faites-vous vacciner, qu'il s'agisse de votre première ou deuxième dose ou de votre dose de rappel. »

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 7 (11,9 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 35 (59,3 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 2 (3,4 %) n'ont reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 15 (25,4 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que seulement 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

Vaccination

Au 9 janvier, 1 856 028 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. En Nouvelle-Écosse, 90,1 % des gens ont reçu leur première dose, 82,9 % ont reçu leur deuxième dose et 19,9 % ont reçu une troisième dose.

Nova Scotia is also reporting three deaths related to COVID-19:
-- a man in his 60s in Eastern Zone
-- a man in his 70s in Northern Zone
-- a man in his 80s in Central zone.

All three contracted COVID-19 during the Omicron wave.

“The Omicron wave has taken three Nova Scotians, and I’m devastated for the loved ones they are leaving behind,” said Premier Tim Houston. “This is exactly why restrictions are needed – as another layer to protect those who are most vulnerable to severe disease. So please, do your part to keep your family, friends and community members safe.”

There are 59 people in hospital with two in ICU. Their ages range from 31 to 100 years old, and the average age is 69. Of the 59 in hospital, 55 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

“My heart goes out to the family and friends of the three Nova Scotians who died,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “There’s no doubt this wave is very different, but there’s also no doubt that the virus can have very severe impacts on some people. We all have a responsibility to protect the people around us who need it and our healthcare system. Follow restrictions and get your vaccine – whether it’s your first, second or booster dose.”

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:
-- 7 (11.9 per cent) people have had a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine
-- 35 (59.3 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 2 (3.4 per cent) are partially vaccinated
-- 15 (25.4 per cent) are unvaccinated.

REMARQUE : La Nouvelle-Écosse publiera des communiqués de presse abrégés sur la COVID-19 les 8 et 9 janvier. Le tableau de bord en ligne sera seulement mis à jour le lundi 10 janvier.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 7 janvier, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Une octogénaire est décédée dans le secteur du centre. 

Il n'est pas possible de confirmer à l'heure actuelle que cette personne était atteinte du variant Omicron, mais elle a été hospitalisée pendant la vague Omicron.

« Je transmets mes plus sincères condoléances à la famille et aux amis qui sont en deuil aujourd'hui, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous devons protéger tout le monde contre ce virus. Faites-vous vacciner et prenez votre dose de rappel dès que possible, faites-vous tester si vous ne vous sentez pas bien et respectez les mesures en matière de santé publique pour vous protéger et pour protéger vos communautés. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 678 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 aujourd'hui.

Il y a 394 cas dans le secteur du centre, 108 dans le secteur de l'est, 97 dans le secteur du nord et 79 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

« Mes pensées et mes prières accompagnent la famille de la dame qui est décédée, a déclaré le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous ne pouvons pas oublier que ce virus est partout, et je ne soulignerai jamais assez à quel point il est essentiel de respecter les mesures sanitaires afin de prévenir la maladie et les décès liés à la COVID-19. Ensemble, nous pouvons ralentir la propagation du virus. »

Quarante-huit personnes sont hospitalisées, dont sept aux soins intensifs. Ces personnes sont âgées de 31 à 94 ans, et l'âge moyen est de 67 ans. Parmi les 48 personnes hospitalisées, 44 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron. 

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 6 (12,5 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 25 (52,1 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 2 (4,2 %) n’ont reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 15 (31,3 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que seulement 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés. 

En raison d'une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. Toutes les personnes ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 doivent aviser leurs contacts étroits. La Santé publique priorise la recherche de contacts dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, les établissements de soins de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et les autres types d'habitation collective.

Les données sur les tests de dépistage rapide ne sont pas disponibles aujourd'hui. Dans le cadre de la nouvelle stratégie sur les tests de dépistage, la Province changera à l'avenir la manière dont elle présente ces données pour inclure le nombre de tests distribués.

Today, January 7, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A woman in her 80s in Central Zone has died. 

It cannot be confirmed that she had the Omicron variant at this time. However, she was hospitalized during the Omicron wave.

“I want to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends who are grieving the loss of their loved one today,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We need to protect everyone from this virus. Please get vaccinated and get your booster shot as soon as you can, get tested if you feel unwell and follow public health measures to help protect yourself and your communities.”

Nova Scotia is also reporting 678 new cases of COVID-19.

Together we can slow the spread of the virus.”

"Premier's Office / COVID - 19 / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Paid Sick Leave Program Opens Monday, January 10","COVID-19/PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Paid Sick Leave Program Opens Monday, January 10
----------------------------------------------------------------
To slow the spread of COVID-19, Nova Scotians are asked to stay home from work if they’re sick. Applications for the Province’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program open Monday, January 10, at 1 p.m. for people who cannot work remotely and must stay home due to COVID-19. 

“We know people want to do the right thing by staying home if they’re sick,” said Premier Tim Houston. “And we also know many workers face financial barriers that stand in the way of that decision. The paid sick leave program will help to remove those barriers. Workers should not have to lose pay for making a responsible decision that protects their co-workers and others.” 

The program is open to employers and self-employed workers. It is consistent with the previous Nova Scotia COVID-19 Sick Leave Program and covers up to four sick leave days for employees, including self-employed workers, up to a maximum of $20 per hour or $160 per day. The maximum payment over the 15-week period is $640 per worker. 

Eligible businesses that continue to pay their employees during their leave, and self-employed workers who miss time, may be reimbursed as quickly as five business days from their application.

The program covers workers who miss less than 50 per cent of their scheduled work time in a one-week period (for example, 15 hours or less in a scheduled 32-hour work week) who need to self-isolate due to exposure, close contact, or because they are experiencing symptoms or getting tested. They may also qualify if employees are going to a vaccine or booster appointment. 

“This is how we keep each other safe and how we keep our doors open for business,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “We are encouraging employers to access this voluntary program to support employees when they need to self-isolate, get tested and attend vaccination appointments.”

The program will be retroactive to include sick days starting December 20, 2021, and will continue until March 31, 2022.

The relaunch of Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program was announced on December 22, 2021. The Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration worked to reopen this voluntary program with assistance from the Department of Health and Wellness to ensure eligibility requirements align with current epidemiology and public health advice. 

The program complements the federal Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, which is available to employees and self-employed workers who have missed 50 per cent or more of their scheduled work week as a result of COVID-19. The federal program runs until May 2022.

Quick Facts:
-- the program originally launched May 26, 2021, and covered sick days from May 10 to July 31, 2021
-- about $600,000 was paid out to Nova Scotians and 4,000 sick days were covered
-- the total program cost, including administration, was just under $1 million

Il est important de noter que seulement 10 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés. 

En raison d'une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. Toutes les personnes ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 doivent aviser leurs contacts étroits. La Santé publique priorise la recherche de contacts dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, les établissements de soins de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et les autres types d'habitation collective.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","745 New Cases of COVID-19, Hospital Outbreaks","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--745 New Cases of COVID-19, Hospital Outbreaks
---------------------------------------------------------
Today, January 6, Nova Scotia is reporting 745 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 459 cases in Central Zone, 128 cases in Eastern Zone, 95 cases in Western Zone and 63 cases in Northern Zone.

There are 48 people in hospital with nine in ICU. Their ages range from 26 to 94 years old, and the average age is 68. Of the 48 in hospital, 44 were admitted during the Omicron wave.

The vaccination status of those in hospital is:

-- 28 (58.3 per cent) are fully vaccinated (two doses)
-- 2 (4.2 per cent) are partially vaccinated
-- 14 (29.2 per cent) are unvaccinated.

It is important to note that only 10 per cent of Nova Scotians are unvaccinated. 

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing delays in follow-up. All cases should contact their close contacts. Public health is prioritizing contact tracing in long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

Information about testing, self-isolation and case management is available at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus .

Hospital Outbreaks

The Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) is reporting a new outbreak at Inverness Consolidated Memorial Hospital. Fewer than five patients at the facility have tested positive. All patients are being closely monitored and other infection prevention and control measures are being put in place.

"Justice","Province Seeks Feedback on Intimate Images and Cyber-protection Act","JUSTICE--Province Seeks Feedback on Intimate Images and Cyber-protection Act 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is asking Nova Scotians for feedback on the Intimate Images and Cyber-protection Act, legislation that came into effect almost four years ago to help protect victims of cyberbullying.

The act provides victims with options to deal with individuals who want to cause them harm online.

“We want to help keep people safe online, so it is important that we review the legislation to ensure that it remains effective,” said Justice Minister and Attorney General Brad Johns. “The feedback we receive will be valuable in helping us see where we can improve the legislation.”

The consultation phase begins today, January 6, with the launch of an online survey. Submissions are also welcome by email, mail and phone. The deadline for submissions is January 28. The survey and more information on the consultation are available at: https://novascotia.ca/intimate-images-and-cyber-protection-act-survey/

A series of targeted focus group sessions is also planned with various people and stakeholder groups, including victims and their families, provincial and police victim-services staff, judges, police, lawyers, academics, advocates and people from diverse communities. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the focus groups will be held virtually.

The Intimate Images and Cyber-protection Act, proclaimed in July 2018, allows victims and families to:
-- participate in restorative approaches to resolve disputes
-- get protection orders for alleged offenders to stop the activity
-- request removal of online content
-- prohibit further contact
-- seek compensation.

Quick Facts:
-- the legislation includes a requirement for the minister to review the act and submit a report to the House of Assembly within four years 
-- Nova Scotia was the first province in Canada to adopt broad legislation addressing cyberbullying and the unwanted sharing of intimate images
-- since July 2018, there have been two court cases with applications for cyber-protection orders under the act
-- the CyberScan unit, which was created under the former Cyber Safety Act, continues to help victims understand their options and navigate the justice system
-- the CyberScan unit worked on 660 cases between July 5, 2018, and December 21, 2021

----------------------------------------------------------------
Le gouvernement provincial demande aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de lui faire part de leurs réactions concernant la loi sur les images intimes et la cybersécurité (Intimate Images and Cyber-protection Act), loi qui est entrée en vigueur il y a près de quatre ans afin de protéger les victimes de la cyberintimidation.

La loi fournit aux victimes des moyens pour composer avec les personnes qui veulent leur faire du mal en ligne.

« Nous voulons assurer la sécurité des gens en ligne et c’est pourquoi il est important d’examiner la loi pour nous assurer qu’elle demeure efficace, de préciser le ministre de la Justice et procureur général Brad Johns. Les commentaires que nous recevrons nous aideront à déterminer comment nous pouvons améliorer certains aspects de ce texte législatif. »

L’étape de la consultation commence aujourd’hui 6 janvier avec le lancement d’un sondage en ligne. Les gens peuvent aussi envoyer leurs commentaires par courriel, par la poste et par téléphone. La date limite pour participer au sondage est le 28 janvier. Le sondage et de plus amples renseignements sur la consultation se trouvent ici : https://novascotia.ca/intimate-images-and-cyber-protection-act-survey/fr/. 

Des groupes de discussion ciblés sont aussi prévus avec diverses personnes et divers groupes d’intéressés, notamment des victimes et leur famille, des employés de services aux victimes de la Province et de services de police, des juges, des policiers, des avocats, des universitaires, des défenseurs des victimes et des gens issus de communautés diversifiées. Compte tenu des restrictions liées à la pandémie, les groupes de discussion se réuniront virtuellement.

La loi sur les images intimes et la cybersécurité, entrée en vigueur en juillet 2018, permet aux victimes et aux familles :  
-- de participer à des démarches de justice réparatrice pour résoudre les conflits;
-- d’obtenir des ordonnances de protection obligeant le présumé contrevenant à cesser l'activité; 
-- de demander la suppression de contenu en ligne;
-- d’interdire tout autre contact avec la victime;
-- d’obtenir une indemnisation.

Faits en bref
-- La loi prévoit que le ministre fasse un examen de la loi et remette un rapport à la Chambre d’assemblée dans les quatre ans. -- La Nouvelle-Écosse a été la première province au Canada à adopter une loi de vaste portée pour lutter contre la cyberintimidation et la diffusion d'images intimes sans consentement.
-- Depuis juillet 2018, au titre de cette loi, deux causes ont été entendues par les tribunaux pour demander des ordonnances de protection. 
-- L'unité CyberScan, qui a été créée dans le cadre de l'ancienne loi sur la cybersécurité (Cyber Safety Act), continue d'aider les victimes à bien comprendre leurs options et à s'y retrouver dans le système juridique.
-- L’unité CyberScan s’est penchée sur 660 dossiers entre le 5 juillet 2018 et le 21 décembre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 5 janvier, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 842 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 498 cas dans le secteur du centre, 141 dans le secteur de l'est, 121 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 82 dans le secteur du nord.

Quarante-cinq personnes sont hospitalisées, dont huit aux soins intensifs. Ces personnes sont âgées de 26 à 98 ans, et l'âge moyen est de 70 ans. Parmi les 45 personnes hospitalisées, 40 ont été admises durant la vague Omicron. 

Parmi les personnes hospitalisées :
-- 5 (11,1 %) ont reçu une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19;
-- 24 (53,3 %) sont entièrement vaccinées (deux doses);
-- 2 (4,4 %) n’ont reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 14 (31,1 %) ne sont pas vaccinées.

Il est important de noter que seulement 10 p. 100 des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne sont pas vaccinés.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Restrictions prolongées, changements aux exigences en matière d'isolement","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE-- Restrictions prolongées, changements aux exigences en matière d'isolement
----------------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse prolonge les restrictions imposées en vue de ralentir la propagation de la COVID-19 jusqu'à la fin du mois de janvier et apporte des changements aux exigences en matière d'isolement.

La Province recommande également que les établissements de soins de longue durée ferment à la plupart des visiteurs pendant les deux prochaines semaines, et lancera le programme de congé de maladie payé la semaine prochaine.

« Le variant Omicron affecte les gens rapidement à l'échelle de la province et continue de se propager très rapidement, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La prolongation des restrictions contribuera à ralentir la propagation. Nous en apprenons davantage sur le variant Omicron tous les jours et nous ajustons les exigences en matière d'isolement pour mieux refléter la maladie actuelle. »

Les restrictions qui sont entrées en vigueur le 22 décembre devaient prendre fin le 12 janvier, mais elles sont maintenant prolongées jusqu'au 31 janvier. Aucune nouvelle restriction n'a été ajoutée.

Les changements aux exigences en matière d'isolement sont basés sur des études récentes qui démontrent qu'une personne ayant contracté le variant Omicron est plus contagieuse quelques jours avant et après l'apparition des symptômes, et que le virus se propage plus rapidement entre les cas et leurs contacts possibles.

Les changements ci-dessous entrent en vigueur pour la plupart des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse le vendredi 7 janvier à 6 h. Ces changements ne s'appliquent pas aux personnes qui travaillent dans des environnements de soins de santé à risque élevé, par exemple les hôpitaux, les services de soins à domicile et les établissements de soins de longue durée. Si une telle personne obtient un résultat positif au test de dépistage ou est considérée comme un contact étroit, elle doit aviser son employeur et respecter les exigences en matière de santé au travail de son employeur plutôt que les exigences ci-dessous.

Nouvelles exigences en matière d'isolement pour les gens qui contractent la COVID-19

Les nouvelles exigences tiennent compte de l'âge, du ménage et du statut vaccinal de la personne :

Personne entièrement vaccinée ou enfant de 11 ans ou moins
-- Isolement d'au moins 7 jours après l'apparition des symptômes ou après un résultat positif au test de dépistage si la personne est asymptomatique.
-- La personne peut mettre fin à son isolement après 7 jours si elle ne présente plus de symptômes ou si elle se sent mieux et elle n'a pas de fièvre depuis au moins 24 heures.

Personne non vaccinée ou partiellement vaccinée et personne immunodéficiente
-- Isolement d'au moins 10 jours. 
-- La personne peut mettre fin à son isolement après 10 jours si elle ne présente plus de symptômes ou si elle se sent mieux et elle n'a pas de fièvre depuis au moins 24 heures.

Les exigences en matière d'isolement s'appliquent peu importe le type de test de dépistage (test rapide ou test PCR en laboratoire).

Changements aux exigences en matière d'isolement pour les contacts étroits

Si une personne entièrement vaccinée ou de 11 ans ou moins est identifiée comme étant un contact étroit d'une personne ayant contracté la COVID-19 : 
-- Elle doit passer un test 72 heures après son exposition à cette personne et surveiller l'apparition de symptômes. 
-- Si elle passe un test PCR, aucun autre test n'est nécessaire sauf en cas d'apparition de symptômes. 
-- Si elle passe un test rapide, elle doit passer un deuxième test rapide 48 heures après le premier.

Jusqu'à l'obtention du premier résultat négatif, elle doit :
-- rester à la maison sauf pour aller à l'école, au travail ou à la garderie;
-- travailler de la maison dans la mesure du possible;
-- maintenir une distance physique de toute autre personne au travail ou à l'école, y compris en mangeant ou en buvant;
-- porter un masque bien ajusté à trois épaisseurs;
-- limiter les activités à celles qui sont essentielles comme faire l'épicerie ou passer prendre des médicaments sur ordonnance si aucune autre personne ne peut le faire pour elle.

Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit s'isoler entièrement et se faire tester.
 
Dans le cas de toute autre personne, y compris les personnes immunodéficientes qui n'ont pas reçu leur dose de rappel :
-- Elle doit s'isoler immédiatement pendant 7 jours.
-- Elle peut mettre fin à son isolement après deux tests rapides négatifs le 6e et le 8e jour ou après un test PCR négatif le 6e ou le 7e jour.
-- Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit s'isoler entièrement et se faire tester.

Isolement dans un ménage

Si une personne atteinte de la COVID-19 peut s'isoler entièrement des autres membres de son ménage, ces derniers peuvent suivre les directives à l'intention des contacts étroits. Toutefois, si l'isolement complet des autres membres du ménage est impossible, ces derniers doivent également s'isoler avec la personne atteinte de la COVID-19, peu importe leur statut vaccinal, et doivent passer un test de dépistage le 3e ou le 4e jour, et un deuxième test le dernier jour de la période d'isolement. L'isolement peut prendre fin si le résultat du dernier test est négatif.

Établissements de soins de longue durée

Le ministère des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée recommande fortement que les établissements de soins de longue durée n'acceptent plus de visiteurs à compter de 6 h vendredi.

Chaque résident peut tout de même recevoir la visite de deux aidants désignés qui offrent du soutien physique et mental.

Il y a actuellement une pénurie d'employés dans ce secteur parce qu'un grand nombre de gens sont en isolement. Il est donc fortement recommandé de ne plus accepter la plupart des visiteurs afin de minimiser le risque de transmission dans les établissements et l'impact d'une exposition au virus sur les résidents et le personnel.

Le Ministère réévaluera la situation le 17 janvier.

Lancement du programme de congé de maladie

Le gouvernement appuiera les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui doivent s'absenter du travail en raison de la COVID-19, soit pour obtenir un vaccin ou passer un test de dépistage, ou pour s'isoler en attendant de passer un test et en attendant les résultats.

Le programme de congé de maladie dans le cadre de la COVID-19 sera lancé le lundi 10 janvier et sera offert de façon rétroactive au 20 décembre 2021.

Faits en bref
-- Les exigences en matière d'isolement après un voyage ne changent pas.
-- Au 4 janvier, 89,7 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont obtenu au moins une dose du vaccin, et 82,7 % sont entièrement vaccinés.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Restrictions Extended, Changes for Self-Isolation, Close Contacts","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Restrictions Extended, Changes for Self-Isolation, Close Contacts
--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia will extend current COVID-19 restrictions until the end of January and make changes to self-isolation requirements.

The Province is also recommending long-term care facilities close to most visitors for two weeks and will launch the paid sick leave program next week.

“The Omicron variant has been rapidly making people sick across the province and continues to spread quickly,” said Dr. Robert Strang, the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Extending the restrictions will help stop the spread. We are learning more about Omicron every day and we are tweaking self-isolation requirements to better reflect the current disease.”

Restrictions that took effect on December 22 were set to expire on January 12 but will now continue until January 31. No new restrictions have been added.

The changes in self-isolation requirements are based on the latest evidence that shows a person with the Omicron variant is most infectious in the couple of days before and after symptoms develop, and the virus transmits more quickly between cases and their susceptible contacts.

The changes below take effect for most Nova Scotians on Friday, January 7, at 6 a.m. The changes do not apply to people who work in a high-risk healthcare setting, such as hospitals, home care and long-term care facilities – whether they test positive or are a close contact, they must notify their employer and follow their occupational health guidance, not the self-isolation requirements below.

New Self-Isolation Requirements for Positive Cases

The new requirements are determined by a person’s age, household situation and vaccination status:

Fully vaccinated person or a child 11 years old or younger
-- must isolate for a minimum of seven days following the onset of symptoms or a positive test if asymptomatic
-- can leave isolation after Day 7 if there are no symptoms or symptoms are improving and there has been no fever for at least 24 hours

Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated person or a person who is immunocompromised
-- must isolate for a minimum of 10 days 
-- can leave isolation after Day 10 if they no longer have symptoms or symptoms are improving and there has been no fever for at least 24 hours.

Isolation requirements apply regardless of the type of test taken (rapid test or lab-based PCR test).

Changes to Isolation Requirements for Close Contacts

If a fully vaccinated person or child who is 11 or younger is identified as a close contact of a positive case:
– they should get tested 72 hours after exposure and watch for symptoms
– if they take a PCR test, no further testing is needed unless they develop symptoms 
– if they take a rapid test, they should do a second rapid test 48 hours after the first.

Until they get their first negative test result, they should:
-- stay at home except to go to school, work or child care
-- work from home as much as possible
-- practise physical distancing when at work or school, including while eating or drinking
-- wear a properly fitted, three-layer mask
-- only do essential activities such as getting groceries or prescriptions if there is nobody else who can do it for them.

For all others, including immunocompromised people who haven’t had a booster:
-- they must immediately isolate for seven days
-- they can leave isolation after two negative rapid tests done on Day 6 and Day 8 or after one negative PCR test done on Day 6 or 7
-- if symptoms develop, they must remain isolated and get tested.

Isolating in Household

If someone with COVID-19 can isolate completely separately from the rest of their household, then other members of the household follow the direction for close contacts. However, if the person cannot isolate completely separately, then other members of the household must isolate along with them for the duration of their isolation – regardless of their vaccination status – and should be tested on Day 3 or 4 and again on the last day of isolation. They can leave isolation if the last test is negative.

Long-Term Care Facilities

The Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care is strongly recommending that long-term care facilities close to visitors, effective Friday at 6 a.m.

Two designated caregivers per resident should still be allowed to visit so they can provide physical and mental support.

The sector is currently experiencing staff shortages because people are in COVID-19 isolation. Temporarily closing to most visitors is strongly advised to minimize the risk of spread in facilities and the impact of exposures to both residents and staff.

The Department will reassess the situation on January 17.

Sick Leave Program Launch

The government will support Nova Scotians who need to miss work because of COVID-19, whether to get a vaccine shot or COVID-19 test, or isolate while waiting for a test or test results.

The Nova Scotia Paid Sick Leave Program will launch Monday, January 10, and is retroactive to December 20, 2021.

Quick Facts:
-- there are no changes to self-isolation related to travel
-- as of January 4, 89.7 per cent of Nova Scotians have at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine with 82.7 per cent fully vaccinated

"Education and Early Childhood Development / COVID - 19","Schools Move to At-Home Learning for One Week","COVID-19/EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Schools Move to At-Home Learning for One Week
----------------------------------------------------------------
Students in Nova Scotia’s public schools will move to at-home learning for one week beginning Monday, January 10. Schools will remain open for students who use learning centres and will reopen to in-person learning on January 17.

“We have heard concerns from families and staff about a return to in-person learning,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Becky Druhan. “By moving to at-home learning for one week, we can take the steps necessary to build confidence by purchasing HEPA filtration systems for schools and classrooms with passive ventilation systems, and by ensuring a good supply of 3-ply masks for all children and staff, including medical masks for staff. Our goal is to provide more comfort and confidence to staff and students as we continue to live with COVID.” 

More information will be sent to families soon from regional centres for education and Conseil scolaire acadien provincial (CSAP).

Schools will follow public health guidance regarding testing, isolation and case management and more information on enhanced public health measures in schools, including reporting of student and staff illness, will be shared with families next week.

During at-home learning, students who are in emergency need of food can call 211 for assistance from Feed Nova Scotia.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Nouvelles cliniques de dose de rappel dans la province","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Nouvelles cliniques de dose de rappel dans la province 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Des cliniques ouvrent leurs portes dans la province ce mois-ci pour administrer la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

De nouvelles cliniques communautaires offriront la dose de rappel sur rendez-vous à compter des dates suivantes :
-- jeudi 6 janvier au Forum d’Halifax;
-- lundi 10 janvier au Acadia Festival Theatre à Wolfville;
-- lundi 17 janvier au centre commercial Mic Mac Mall de Dartmouth;
-- lundi 24 janvier au campus de Truro du Nova Scotia Community College. 

Certains centres de dépistage de la COVID-19 déjà en place offriront aussi la dose de rappel sur rendez-vous. L’administration de la dose de rappel commencera aux endroits suivants dès le lundi 10 janvier :
-- Rath Eastlink Community Centre, Truro; 
-- Centre d’évaluation du comté de Pictou, New Glasgow;
-- Centre d’évaluation du comté de Cumberland, Amherst;
-- Antigonish Market Square, Antigonish;
-- Caserne des pompiers du chemin Grand Lake, Sydney;
-- Caserne des pompiers de Berwick, Berwick;
-- Mariners Centre, Yarmouth.

Le centre de dépistage de la gare de Digby offrira la dose de rappel sur rendez-vous à compter du lundi 24 janvier.

Les personnes de 30 ans et plus peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir leur dose de rappel au moins 168 jours après avoir reçu la deuxième dose de leur série vaccinale primaire. Pour les personnes afro-néo-écossaises et celles dans les communautés des Premières Nations, l’âge minimum pour l’admissibilité à la dose de rappel est fixé à 18 ans.

Même si beaucoup de rendez-vous dans les centres de vaccination courants sont déjà pris, les gens qui ont encore besoin d’un rendez-vous sont invités à être patients et à retourner sur le site de prise de rendez-vous, car de nouveaux rendez-vous sont ajoutés souvent, y compris pour les nouvelles cliniques communautaires. 

Beaucoup de personnes en Nouvelle-Écosse ont répondu à l’appel pour aider à l’effort d’administration de la dose de rappel du vaccin. Jusqu’à maintenant, la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse (la Régie) a reçu environ 2 350 offres de services de la part de personnes qui souhaitent apporter leur contribution dans les cliniques de vaccination. Environ 850 pourraient être des vaccinateurs et environ 1 500 pourraient remplir un rôle non médical. La Régie a commencé à étudier les offres de services, à affecter des gens à des rôles qui leur conviennent et à les former; ce travail se poursuivra selon les besoins.

Les cliniques existantes dans les pharmacies et les cabinets de médecins et celles à l’intention des travailleurs de la santé poursuivront leurs activités. Les cliniques de vaccination sans rendez-vous poursuivent aussi leurs activités et pourront accueillir plus de gens.

Les personnes qui n’ont pas encore reçu leur série vaccinale primaire peuvent toujours prendre rendez-vous. L’intervalle entre la première et la deuxième dose est maintenant de 56 jours, au lieu de 28, et ce, conformément aux lignes directrices du Comité consultatif national de l’immunisation. 

Faits en bref-- Les gens qui ont reçu deux doses du vaccin d'AstraZeneca ou le vaccin Janssen à une dose sont toujours admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel d'un vaccin à base d'ARNm.
-- Tous les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne, y compris les fournisseurs de soins de santé qui offrent des soins directs aux patients dans la communauté, et tous les aidants désignés sont toujours admissibles à la dose de rappel, peu importe leur âge. 
-- Il est fortement recommandé aux personnes de moins de 30 ans de prendre un rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer; un plus grand nombre de rendez-vous pour ce vaccin seront disponibles dès que la Province recevra un autre stock de ce produit.
-- On encourage les personnes de 30 ans et plus à prendre un rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin de Moderna afin de réserver le vaccin de Pfizer pour les personnes qui en ont besoin.

Ressources supplémentaires Les gens peuvent prendre rendez-vous en ligne pour leur série vaccinale primaire ou pour la dose de rappel à l’adresse https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou ils peuvent téléphoner sans frais au 1-833-797-7772.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinics are opening across the province this month to give Nova Scotians booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

New community clinics will offer vaccine by appointment starting:
-- Thursday, January 6, at the Halifax Forum
-- Monday, January 10, at the Acadia Festival Theatre in Wolfville
-- Monday, January 17, at Mic Mac Mall in Dartmouth
-- Monday, January 24, at the Nova Scotia Community College campus in Truro.

Some existing COVID-19 testing centres will also offer vaccine by appointment. The following centres will start vaccinations on Monday, January 10:

-- Pictou County Assessment Centre, New Glasgow
-- Cumberland County Assessment Centre, Amherst
-- Antigonish Market Square, Antigonish
-- Grand Lake Road Fire Hall, Sydney
-- Berwick Fire Hall, Berwick
-- Mariners Centre, Yarmouth.

The Digby Station testing centre will offer vaccine by appointment starting Monday, January 24.

People who are 30 or older can book a booster dose at least 168 days after they received the second dose of their primary series. For African Nova Scotians and people in First Nations communities, the age for boosters is 18 and older.

While many appointments at current vaccination locations have already been booked, Nova Scotians who still need to book one are encouraged to be patient and check back as appointments are being added often, including at the new community clinics. 

Many Nova Scotians have answered the call to help the booster-dose effort. To date, the Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) has about 2,350 applications from people offering to help at vaccination clinics. About 850 are potential immunizers and about 1,500 may be able to serve in non-clinical roles. The NSHA has begun screening, matching people with appropriate roles and training, and that will continue as needed.

Existing pharmacy, physician, IWK and healthcare worker clinics are continuing. Drop-in vaccination clinics are also continuing and will have increased capacity.

People who have not yet received their primary series of vaccine can still book appointments. The interval between first and second doses is now 56 days, up from 28, following National Advisory Committee on Immunization guidelines.

Quick Facts:
-- people who received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine or one dose of Janssen are still eligible to schedule a booster dose of mRNA vaccine
-- all frontline healthcare workers, including community healthcare providers who provide direct patient care, and all designated caregivers are still eligible for a booster dose regardless of age
-- it is strongly recommended that people under 30 book Pfizer appointments; more Pfizer appointments will be available once the province has received more supply of this vaccine
-- people who are 30 and older are encouraged to book Moderna appointments in order to prioritize Pfizer for those who need it

-----------------------------------------------------------------
La Province offre maintenant la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 à toute personne de 30 ans ou plus. 

La dose de rappel est administrée au moins 168 jours après la série principale de vaccins. Les gens qui ont reçu deux doses du vaccin d'AstraZeneca ou le vaccin Janssen à une dose sont toujours admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel d'un vaccin à base d'ARNm.

Les groupes suivants sont toujours admissibles à la dose de rappel, peu importe l'âge :
-- tous les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne, y compris les fournisseurs de soins de santé qui offrent des soins directs aux patients dans la communauté;
-- tous les aidants désignés.

Des études récentes démontrent que les jeunes adultes sont plus à risque de souffrir de myocardite ou de péricardite après l'administration du vaccin de Moderna comparativement au vaccin de Pfizer. Il est maintenant fortement recommandé que toute personne de moins de 30 ans reçoive le vaccin de Pfizer.

Les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne et les fournisseurs de soins de santé dans la communauté qui ont moins de 30 ans et qui sont admissibles à la dose de rappel devront présenter une preuve de leur désignation, et on les encourage à avoir leur permis professionnel, leur carte d'identité pour le travail ou une lettre de leur employeur. Les fournisseurs sont :
-- les médecins, les infirmières et les auxiliaires en soins continus qui travaillent en pratique communautaire ou qui assurent des soins à domicile;
-- les dentistes, les assistants dentaires, les hygiénistes dentaires et les denturologistes;
-- les pharmaciens, les assistants en pharmacie et les techniciens en pharmacie.

Toute personne admissible à recevoir une dose de rappel peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou en composant le numéro sans frais 1-833-797-7772.

On encourage les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à faire preuve de patience, car le nombre de rendez-vous est limité à l'heure actuelle. Si vous n'arrivez pas à trouver un rendez-vous dans votre région, d'autres rendez-vous seront ajoutés sous peu. Les rendez-vous sont ajoutés dans les cliniques à l'échelle de la province de façon continue. 

Faits en bref
-- Il y a environ 451 000 personnes de 30 ans et plus en Nouvelle-Écosse qui sont ou qui deviendront admissibles à la dose de rappel en janvier et qui pourront prendre rendez-vous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province has expanded eligibility for COVID-19 booster doses to include anyone 30 years of age and older. 

Booster doses are administered at least 168 days after the primary series. People who received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine or the one-dose Janssen vaccine are still eligible to schedule a booster dose of mRNA vaccine.

The following groups are still eligible for a booster dose regardless of age:
-- all frontline healthcare workers, including community healthcare providers who provide direct patient care
-- all designated caregivers

Recent evidence shows that there is an increased risk of myocarditis/pericarditis in young adults from Moderna vaccine as compared to Pfizer vaccine. It is now strongly recommended that those under age 30 receive Pfizer vaccine.

Frontline and community healthcare providers who are under the age of 30 and eligible for a booster dose should be prepared to provide proof of designation and are encouraged to bring their professional licence, work identification or letter from their employer to their appointment. Providers include:
-- doctors, nurses and continuing care assistants who work in community practice or provide care in the home
-- dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists and denturists
-- pharmacists, pharmacy assistants and pharmacy technicians.

Anyone eligible for a booster dose can schedule an appointment online at https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling the toll-free line: 1-833-797-7772.

Nova Scotians are encouraged to be patient as vaccine appointments are currently limited. If you cannot find an appointment in your area, more will be added. Appointments are added to clinics across the province on an ongoing basis. 

Quick Facts:
-- there are about 451,000 Nova Scotians age 30 and older who are or will become eligible to schedule a booster dose in January.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","La Nouvelle-Écosse accélère son programme de dose de rappel","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--La Nouvelle-Écosse accélère son programme de dose de rappel 
---------------------------------------------------- 
La Nouvelle-Écosse accélère l’administration des doses de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 en ajoutant plus de cliniques et plus de vaccinateurs un peu partout dans la province. 

Avec en main un stock suffisant du vaccin fourni par le gouvernement fédéral, le programme de vaccination sera considérablement élargi pour répondre à la demande des doses de rappel tout en continuant d’accorder la priorité aux première et deuxième doses ainsi qu’au vaccin administré aux enfants. 

À compter de la semaine prochaine, les rendez-vous ouvriront pour la dose de rappel pour les personnes de 30 ans et plus. On pourra prendre un rendez-vous au moins 168 jours après avoir reçu la série vaccinale primaire.

« Voilà deux ans que dure la pandémie, le nombre de cas augmente et il y a un variant facilement transmissible : tout cela montre pourquoi la vaccination continue d’être essentielle pour nous protéger et pour nous permettre de reprendre nos activités, a indiqué le premier ministre Tim Houston. Afin de fournir aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse la dose supplémentaire de protection dont ils ont besoin, nous élargissons nos efforts et nous ajoutons des cliniques et des vaccinateurs pour accélérer le plus possible le processus de vaccination. » 

Les pharmacies continueront de jouer un rôle clé dans l’administration du vaccin antiCOVID-19 dans la province. Les mesures additionnelles suivantes seront mises en place au cours des quelques prochaines semaines pour élargir notre capacité :
-- Une clinique de vaccination communautaire ouvrira ses portes dans le secteur du centre le 6 janvier au Forum d’Halifax. On pourra commencer à prendre rendez-vous au début de la semaine prochaine. D’autres cliniques sont à l’étude dans d’autres secteurs de la Régie de la santé.
-- Nous ouvrirons dès la mi-janvier des cliniques hybrides pour les tests et la vaccination en faisant appel aux centres d'évaluation primaire qui existent déjà dans les secteurs du nord, de l’est et de l’ouest.  Les rendez-vous pour les tests et pour la vaccination seront proposés à différents moments de la journée.
-- Nous déploierons également des cliniques mobiles de proximité sans rendez-vous pour accroître la capacité de vaccination là où c’est nécessaire. 

Le vaccin sera aussi administré dans une clinique au IWK, dans différentes cliniques de médecine familiale, et aux travailleurs de la santé dans les cliniques de Santé Nouvelle-Écosse. 

La Province travaille avec la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse pour retenir les services de toute personne capable d’administrer des vaccins, y compris les professionnels de la santé en poste et à la retraite. Toute personne qui a l’expérience et les connaissances pour administrer un vaccin ou les personnes qui veulent aider dans une clinique dans un rôle non médical peuvent manifester leur intérêt en suivant ce lien : https://www.nshealth.ca/covidjobs. 

« La dose de rappel est un outil important pour mieux vous protéger et pour mieux protéger les autres contre le virus, a souligné le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Je tiens à remercier l’équipe qui s’efforce d’augmenter le nombre de doses de vaccin que nous pouvons administrer dans la province et les personnes qui offriront leurs services pour aider aux efforts d’immunisation et pour travailler dans les cliniques. Encore une fois, nous avons besoin de votre aide et je sais que vous répondrez à notre appel. » 

À mesure que les nouvelles cliniques seront prêtes à fonctionner, elles seront ajoutées à la liste des cliniques dans la page de prise de rendez-vous pour le vaccin antiCOVID-19. 

Toute personne admissible à recevoir une dose de rappel peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou en composant le numéro sans frais 1-833-797-7772.

Faits en bref
-- Au 30 décembre, environ 102 000 doses de rappel ont été administrées dans la collectivité; plus de 25 000 ont été administrées dans d’autres milieux.-- Il y a environ 451 000 personnes de 30 ans et plus en Nouvelle-Écosse qui sont ou qui deviendront admissibles à la dose de rappel en janvier.
-- Il y a environ 87 000 personnes de 18 à 29 ans en Nouvelle-Écosse qui sont ou qui deviendront admissibles à la dose de rappel en janvier.
-- Le Programme de congé de maladie payé en raison de la COVID-19 de la Nouvelle-Écosse devrait être relancé le 10 janvier 2022. Le programme sera rétroactif pour englober les jours de maladie à compter du 20 décembre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is ramping up its delivery of COVID-19 booster doses, adding more clinics and more immunizers across the province. 

With adequate vaccine supply secured from the federal government, the vaccine program will be significantly expanded to meet the demand for booster doses, while still prioritizing first, second and pediatric doses. 

Starting next week, booking for booster doses will open to people age 30 and older. Appointments can be booked for at least 168 days after completing a primary series.

“Two years into this pandemic, rising case counts and a highly transmissible new variant demonstrate why vaccination continues to be critical to keep us safe and to move us forward,” said Premier Tim Houston. “To provide more Nova Scotians with the additional dose of protection they need, we are increasing our efforts and adding more clinics and immunizers to get vaccine into arms as quickly as possible.”

Pharmacies will continue to be key in delivering COVID-19 vaccine across the province. The following additions will take place over the next couple weeks, to expand capacity:
-- community vaccine clinic in Central zone starting January 6 at the Halifax Forum. Appointments will go live early next week. Additional clinics are being explored in other health zones
-- hybrid testing/vaccine clinics using existing Primary Assessment Centre locations in Northern, Eastern and Western Zones by mid-January. Testing and vaccine appointments will be provided at different times of day
-- drop-in mobile outreach clinics will also be deployed to increase vaccination capacity where needed. 

Vaccine will also be delivered through a clinic at the IWK, through various physician clinics and to healthcare workers via Nova Scotia Health clinics. 

The Province is working with the Nova Scotia Health Authority to enlist the services of anyone who is able to help administer vaccine, including existing and retired healthcare professionals. Anyone who has the expertise to administer a vaccine, or those interested in helping in a clinic in a non-medical role, can express their interest to support at https://www.nshealth.ca/covidjobs .

“Booster doses are an important part of further protecting yourself and others from the virus,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “I want to thank the team working to increase the amount of vaccine we can deliver across the province and those who will come forward to help immunize and work in clinics. Once again, we need your support and I know you will answer the call.” 

As additional clinics come online, they will be added to the list of clinics on the COVID-19 booking page. 

Anyone eligible for a booster dose can schedule an appointment online at https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling the toll-free line: 1-833-797-7772.

Quick Facts:
-- as of December 30, about 102,000 booster doses have been administered in community; more than 25,000 have been delivered in other settings 
-- there are about 451,000 Nova Scotians age 30 and older who are or will become eligible to schedule a booster dose in January
–there are about 87,000 Nova Scotians between the ages of 18 and 29 who are or will become eligible to schedule a booster dose in January
-- Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program is expected to relaunch January 10, 2022. The program will be retroactive to include sick days starting from December 20, 2021

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","Nova Scotia Sees Another Record-Setting Year for Immigration","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Nova Scotia Sees Another Record-Setting Year for Immigration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia continues to surpass previous immigration records as the Province’s population reaches an all-time high, exceeding one million.

The Province approved 4,100 applications, with a focus on attracting skilled newcomers to essential services used by Nova Scotians, such as healthcare, transportation, skilled trades, education and hospitality. 

In addition to strong immigration numbers, Nova Scotia experienced its sixth year of increased inter-provincial migration growth. Since 2015, inter-provincial migration has been increasing, leading to nearly 10,000 net new people coming to Nova Scotia from other provinces and territories in 2020-21. 

“Nova Scotia is rapidly growing, and with planned growth comes many opportunities,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “Newcomers fuel our economy, create new businesses and jobs, fill labour gaps and add to the diversity and culture in our communities. As we look ahead to 2022, we will continue to attract, welcome and retain global talent to enrich our province and create further economic growth.”

As of October 31, 6,169 permanent residents arrived in Nova Scotia this year, up from 3,001 over the same period last year. In 2019, Nova Scotia saw its highest number of immigrants landing in one year 7,580, and despite the pandemic, 2021 is on track to exceed that number.

Nova Scotia’s retention rate remains strong at 71 per cent – the highest in Atlantic Canada. Nova Scotia’s settlement partners play a lead role in helping newcomers adapt to life in the province and preparing employers through intercultural competency training. These efforts significantly impact retention. Throughout the pandemic, these dedicated organizations have adapted to ensure accessibility of their services and programming to support newcomers.

The Department continues to be innovative and responsive to current and emerging labour needs and is focused on and committed to working with businesses, across government, and other stakeholders to ensure the Province has immigration programs that benefit employers, Nova Scotians and communities.

Nova Scotia is aiming to double its population to two million by 2060 with a goal to attract 25,000 newcomers per year through a combination of migration from other parts of Canada and strategic immigration efforts.

Quick Facts:
-- of the approved 4,100 applications, 1,657 are from the Atlantic Immigration Program and 2,443 from the Provincial Nominee Program. On December 17, The Province and the Government of Canada announced that the Atlantic Immigration Program will be a permanent pathway for designated employers to hire skilled workers, coming into effect in January 2022
-- the Province has approved 1,534 registered nurses and continuing care assistants since 2015, which are the two most approved foreign professions in Nova Scotia
-- the Province approved applications of 68 early childhood educators in 2021
-- 1,735 international graduates have been approved to stay and live in Nova Scotia after their studies in 2021
-- from January 1 to April 1, 2021, 5,696 people moved to Nova Scotia from other countries and other parts of Canada, and the province’s population grew by 2,877 – the largest increase in a first quarter since 1971
-- In November the Department added food counter attendants, kitchen helpers, related support occupations, food and beverage servers and light duty cleaners to the Occupations in Demand immigration stream to help business owners in the service industry address labour shortages

-------------------------------------------------------
Le congé des fêtes sera prolongé. Les élèves retourneront en classe le lundi 10 janvier et les enseignants et autres membres du personnel le mardi 4 janvier.  

Le congé prolongé permettra aux familles de surveiller les élèves pour s'assurer qu'ils ne présentent aucun symptôme de la COVID-19 avant de retourner à l'école. Il permettra également aux écoles de mettre en place des mesures sanitaires plus rigoureuses. 

« Nous savons que le meilleur endroit pour les élèves est à l'école, où ils ont un accès continu à l'apprentissage, au soutien et aux services dont ils ont besoin pour leur bien-être émotionnel et mental, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Pour assurer la sécurité de notre personnel et de nos élèves et pour appuyer les efforts de la Santé publique visant à ralentir la propagation de la COVID-19 afin de protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables et notre système de soins de santé, nous mettons en place des mesures sanitaires supplémentaires. »

Le nombre élevé de cas causés par le variant Omicron de la COVID-19 a forcé la Nouvelle-Écosse à modifier son approche en matière de dépistage et de gestion des cas. La Santé publique concentre ses efforts sur les personnes qui sont à risque plus élevé de souffrir d'une maladie grave et d'être hospitalisées. On demande aux personnes qui ne sont pas considérées comme étant à risque élevé de faire des tests à la maison et de gérer leur cas elles-mêmes, y compris la communication avec tous les contacts étroits. Cette approche s'appliquera également aux écoles. La Santé publique cessera la recherche de contacts dans les environnements scolaires. Les élèves qui sont malades ou qui sont des contacts étroits doivent rester à la maison et suivre les conseils de la Santé publique, qui sont disponibles en ligne. 

Des renseignements sur le dépistage, l'isolement et la gestion des cas se trouvent au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus (en anglais seulement).

« Nous sommes à l'apogée de la vague la plus importante jusqu'à présent, et cette vague a un impact sur la façon dont nous gérons les cas de COVID-19 et dont nous intervenons, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous avons déjà modifié notre approche envers la gestion des cas et du dépistage pour concentrer nos efforts sur les personnes qui sont les plus à risque de souffrir d'une maladie grave et d'être hospitalisées. Nous appliquons maintenant cette approche aux écoles puisque la COVID-19 entraîne généralement des symptômes légers chez les enfants. Nous devons trouver l'équilibre entre le risque de propagation dans les écoles et les désavantages considérables qui découlent de l'absence de l'école et de l'apprentissage à la maison. Les écoles mettront en place des protections supplémentaires qui contribueront à minimiser la propagation et à assurer la sécurité des élèves et du personnel à l'école. »

Des mesures sanitaires plus rigoureuses seront mises en place dans toutes les écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse, notamment des mesures visant à contrôler le mouvement des élèves et les interactions entre les groupes afin de minimiser la propagation du variant Omicron, par exemple :
-- créer des cohortes strictes
-- ne permettre aucune assemblée, aucun rassemblement et aucun événement de grande envergure
-- ne permettre aucun visiteur non essentiel 
-- rappeler aux familles de garder les élèves à la maison lorsqu'ils sont malades
-- porter un masque de façon appropriée
-- continuer le lavage régulier des mains et le nettoyage plus fréquent 

On demandera aux élèves de porter les masques à trois épaisseurs qui ont été distribués au début de l'année scolaire, ou un masque équivalent. Des masques supplémentaires à trois épaisseurs ont été commandés, et chaque élève et membre du personnel recevra un masque supplémentaire. Les masques à une ou deux épaisseurs n'offrent pas une protection suffisante. Le port du masque sera toujours exigé en tout temps à l'intérieur, sauf pour manger et boire. 

Le plan de distribution d'autres tests rapides aux élèves dépend de l'approvisionnement du gouvernement fédéral. Les écoles transmettront des renseignements supplémentaires aux familles au sujet des mesures plus rigoureuses la semaine du 4 janvier.

Faits en bref
-- Les écoles respecteront les règles communautaires pour les sports. Des renseignements à ce sujet se trouvent au https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/restrictions-and-guidance/fr/#gatherings .
-- Le personnel scolaire se présentera au travail le 4 janvier en vue de la préparation pour le retour des élèves, d'une formation sur la sécurité liée à la COVID-19 et de perfectionnement professionnel. 
-- Les centres d'apprentissage ouvriront le 4 janvier (le 5 janvier au Centre régional pour l'éducation Chignecto-Central) pour les élèves qui dépendent des centres d'apprentissage et qui ont besoin de soutien supplémentaire.

"Education and Early Childhood Development / COVID - 19","Public School Holiday Break Extended; Contact Tracing in Schools to Stop","COVID-19/EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Public School Holiday Break Extended; Contact Tracing in Schools to Stop
------------------------------------------------------
The holiday break for students will be extended with students returning to class on Monday, January 10 and teachers and other school staff returning Tuesday, January 4.  

The extended break allows families to monitor students for COVID-19 symptoms before they return to school. It also allows more time for schools to ensure they have enhanced public health measures in place. 

“We know that the best place for students is in school where they have continued access to learning and the supports and services they need for their emotional and mental well-being,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “To support the safety of staff and students, and to support public health efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 to protect those who are more vulnerable for severe disease and our healthcare system, we are introducing additional public health measures.”

High case numbers driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 have led to changes in Nova Scotia’s approach to testing and case management. Public Health is focusing its efforts on those at highest risk of severe disease and hospitalization. Those not considered high risk are being asked to test at home and self-manage their case, including contacting all close contacts. This approach will be extended to schools. Public Health will no longer contact trace in school settings. Students who are sick or who are close contacts of a known case should stay home and follow public health guidance that is available online. 

Information about testing, self-isolation and case management is available at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus .

“We’re at the peak of the most significant wave that we’ve seen yet and it’s impacting how we manage and respond to COVID-19,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “We’ve already changed our approach to case management and testing to focus on those at highest risk of severe disease and hospitalization. We’re extending this method to schools as COVID-19 is generally a mild disease for children. We need to balance the risk of spread in schools with the significant harms that come from not being in school and learning at home. Schools will have layers of protection in place that will help minimize spread and keep students and staff safe in school.”

Stronger public health measures will be introduced to all of Nova Scotia’s public schools. This will include measures to control the movement of students and mixing of groups to minimize the spread of the Omicron variant. This will include:
-- strict cohorting 
-- no large assemblies, gatherings or events
-- no non-essential visitors 
-- reminding families to keep students home when they're sick 
-- proper mask wearing
-- continuation of regular hand hygiene and enhanced cleaning 

All students will be advised to wear the 3-ply cloth masks that were distributed at the start of the school year, or an equivalent. More 3-ply masks have been ordered and all staff and students will each receive an additional 3-ply mask. One and two-ply masks do not offer sufficient protection. Masks will continue to be required at all times indoors, except while eating and drinking. 

A plan to distribute more rapid tests to students is based on supply availability from the Federal Government. Schools will share more information with families about enhanced measures the week of January 4.

Quick Facts:
-- school sports will follow the community rules for sports. Information is available online at: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/restrictions-and-guidance/#gatherings
-- school staff will report to work on January 4 to prepare for the return of students, refresh COVID-19 safety training and professional development 
-- learning centres will open on January 4, or January 5 in Chignecto-Central Regional Centre for Education, for students whose needs are met through learning centres and require additional support

Aujourd'hui 28 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 561 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 430 cas dans le secteur du centre, 54 dans le secteur de l'est, 39 dans le secteur du nord et 38 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Le 27 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé 4 292 tests. 

La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse signale un cas supplémentaire lié à une éclosion dans une unité au Halifax Infirmary du Centre des sciences de la santé QEII. Six patients ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19. Tous les patients sont surveillés de près et d'autres mesures de contrôle et de prévention des infections sont mises en place. Des tests de dépistage sont en cours chez le personnel.

En raison d'une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. Toutes les personnes ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 doivent aviser leurs contacts étroits. La Santé publique priorise la recherche de contacts dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, les établissements de soins de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et les autres types d'habitation collective.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Le nombre élevé de cas causés par le variant Omicron de la COVID-19 force la Nouvelle-Écosse à modifier son approche de dépistage et de gestion des cas.

« Les ressources pour les tests analysés en laboratoire sont limitées, tout comme l'approvisionnement en tests rapides au cours des prochaines semaines. Nous devons utiliser ces ressources judicieusement compte tenu de l'épidémiologie actuelle, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Notre priorité pour les tests PCR doit être les personnes les plus vulnérables à la maladie et les personnes qui maintiennent le fonctionnement de notre système de soins de santé. Toutefois, chaque personne qui a besoin d'un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 pourra en obtenir un. »

Plus d'un million de tests rapides ont été distribués partout dans la province en décembre. Bien qu'initialement, on encourageait les gens à les utiliser à titre de précaution pour des rassemblements en toute sécurité, ces ressources devraient maintenant être utilisées principalement lorsque les gens présentent des symptômes ou sont identifiés comme étant des contacts étroits.

« Il ne faut pas utiliser ces précieuses ressources tous les deux ou trois jours simplement pour se sentir en sécurité. Nous devons mettre l'accent sur le dépistage pour les personnes qui présentent des symptômes ou qui sont des contacts étroits, souligne le Dr Strang. Pendant au moins quelques semaines, il faut limiter nos contacts sociaux à notre groupe toujours formé des mêmes 10 personnes, qui inclut les membres de notre ménage, donc il ne devrait pas être nécessaire de faire des tests avant les occasions sociales. »

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes ou qui est un contact étroit d'un cas confirmé de COVID-19 doit d'isoler immédiatement. Aujourd'hui 24 décembre et pendant la fin de semaine, un test PCR peut être fait si un rendez-vous est disponible dans la région. Sinon, vous pouvez utiliser un test rapide, si vous en avez un, ou vous rendre à une clinique temporaire. Les cliniques temporaires du Convention Centre à Halifax et d'Alderney Landing à Dartmouth se poursuivent. D'autres cliniques temporaires et les unités mobiles de santé publique seront organisées dans d'autres endroits de la province à compter de la semaine prochaine. 

À compter du lundi 27 décembre, les personnes qui sont des contacts étroits ou qui présentent des symptômes devront faire l'auto-évaluation en ligne pour déterminer quel genre de test ils doivent passer et prendre rendez-vous.

On demandera à la plupart des personnes qui sont des contacts étroits ou qui ont des symptômes de prendre rendez-vous pour obtenir un test rapide à faire à la maison auprès d'un centre d'évaluation.

Seules certaines personnes qui sont des contacts étroits ou qui présentent des symptômes pourront prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR à un centre de dépistage, y compris les personnes qui sont à risque élevé de maladie grave, qui vivent dans une habitation collective, qui sont hospitalisées ou qui sont essentielles au fonctionnement du système de soins de santé.

Les autres personnes qui pourront prendre rendez-vous pour passer un test PCR sont :
-- les voyageurs internes qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés et qui ont besoin de deux résultats négatifs pour mettre fin à leur isolement en Nouvelle-Écosse;
-- les travailleurs en rotation et les travailleurs spécialisés qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés et qui doivent se faire tester jusqu'à trois fois pendant qu'ils sont en Nouvelle-Écosse.

Les personnes qui obtiennent un résultat positif après un test de dépistage rapide doivent aviser la Santé publique en envoyant leur nom, leur date de naissance, leur numéro de carte santé (s'il y a lieu) et leurs coordonnées par courriel à l'adresse PublicHealthPOCT@nshealth.ca.  Ils doivent aviser tous leurs contacts étroits et suivre les directives à l'intention des personnes qui obtiennent un résultat positif au test de dépistage : https://www.nshealth.ca/testedpositiveforcovid (en anglais seulement).

Pour en savoir plus sur le dépistage, l'isolement et les mesures à prendre si vous obtenez un résultat négatif ou positif à un test PCR ou un test rapide, consultez le site Web de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus (en anglais seulement).

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Changes in COVID-19 Testing and Case Management","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Changes in COVID-19 Testing and Case Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High case numbers driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are forcing changes in Nova Scotia’s approach to testing and case management.

“We have finite resources for lab-based testing, and we also have a limited supply of rapid tests over the next few weeks. We need to use those resources wisely given the current epidemiology,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Our priority for PCR testing has to be on people who are most vulnerable to disease and people who are needed to keep our healthcare system running. But everyone who needs a COVID-19 test will get one.”

More than a million rapid tests were distributed around the province in December. While Nova Scotians were initially encouraged to use them as a precaution for safe gatherings, these resources should now primarily be used when people have symptoms or are identified as close contacts.

“Nobody should be using these precious resources every few days just to feel safe. We need to focus most testing on people who have symptoms or are close contacts,” said Dr. Strang. “For at least the next few weeks, everyone needs to limit socializing to their consistent group of 10 which includes their own household, so there shouldn’t be a need for a lot of testing for social occasions.”

Everyone who has symptoms or who is a close contact of someone who has COVID-19 must immediately self-isolate. Today, December 24, and over the weekend, they can book PCR tests if appointments are available in their area. If not, they can use a rapid test if they have one or go to a pop-up site. The Halifax Convention Centre and Dartmouth Alderney Landing pop-ups are continuing. Other pop-ups and the public health mobile unit are being organized to focus on other locations around the province starting next week. 

Starting Monday, December 27, people who are close contacts or have symptoms will need to complete the online self-assessment to find out which kind of test they need and book an appointment.

Most Nova Scotians who are close contacts or have symptoms will be directed to book an appointment to get a take-home rapid test from a testing centre.

Only certain people who are close contacts or have symptoms will be directed to book an appointment for a PCR test at a testing centre. This includes people who are at increased risk for severe disease, live in congregate settings, are being admitted to hospital or are integral to keeping the health system running.

The only other people who can book a PCR test are:
-- domestic travellers who are not fully vaccinated and need two negative test results to stop isolating in Nova Scotia
-- rotational workers and specialized workers who are not fully vaccinated and are required to get tested up to three times while in Nova Scotia.

When people test positive on a rapid test, they should notify public health by emailing their name, date of birth, health card number (if they have one) and contact information to PublicHealthPOCT@nshealth.ca. They need to advise their close contacts and follow directions for people who test positive at: https://www.nshealth.ca/testedpositiveforcovid .

More information and instructions on testing, isolation and next steps if either a PCR or rapid test result is negative or positive is available at the Nova Scotia Health Authority website: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus .

"Public Works","New Interchange Opens in Lantz","Public Works--New Interchange Opens in Lantz
----------------------------------------------------------------
A new interchange on Highway 102 will help reduce traffic congestion and provide a safer commute for Nova Scotians.

The Lantz interchange officially opened today, December 23. The completed project includes:
-- four new ramps forming a diamond interchange
-- a roundabout at each intersection of on- and off-ramps
-- a kilometre-long controlled access connector road linking Highway 102 to Trunk 2
-- a roundabout at Trunk 2
-- two new three-lane bridges over Nine Mile River on Highway 102
-- widening of both the northbound and southbound lanes of Highway 102. 

“We want to ensure our roads and highways are safe,” said Hants East MLA John MacDonald, on behalf of Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “The new Lantz interchange and connector will improve traffic and reduce traffic congestion. It will help families, residents and visitors reach their destinations more safely and efficiently.”

This is a $28-million project with the provincial and federal governments each contributing $14 million.

Quotes:
“I am proud of the investment our government has made to create the Lantz interchange. This will help reduce commuting times for residents and has also served as an economic catalyst for the area as we have already seen a significant growth in residential and commercial development since the announcement of the interchange, which bodes well for East Hants in the days ahead.”
     - Kody Blois, Member of Parliament for Kings-Hants

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 23 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 689 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 498 cas dans le secteur du centre, 55 dans le secteur de l'est, 79 dans le secteur du nord et 57 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

En raison d’une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d’isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu’un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

On trouvera ici des renseignements sur les tests, l’isolement et la gestion des cas (en anglais) : https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus.

Établissements de soins de longue durée, hôpitaux, écoles
La Province signale une éclosion à l’établissement Roseway Manor à Shelburne. Deux employés ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Aucun n’est hospitalisé ou n’a eu de contact avec les résidents. Tous les employés sont entièrement vaccinés et 98 p. 100 des résidents sont entièrement vaccinés et ont reçu leur dose de rappel. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour freiner la propagation du virus. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Aucun nouveau cas n'est signalé aujourd'hui au foyer de soins Parkstone Enhanced Care d’Halifax.  Deux résidents et un employé de l’établissement avaient reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage. Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés et tous les résidents admissibles ont reçu leur dose de rappel. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour freiner la propagation du virus. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","689 New Cases of COVID-19, Long-Term Care Outbreak","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--689 New Cases of COVID-19, Long-Term Care Outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 23, Nova Scotia is reporting 689 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 498 cases in Central Zone, 55 cases in Eastern Zone, 79 cases in Northern Zone and 57 cases in Western Zone.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

Information about testing, self-isolation and case management is at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus

Long-term Care Facilities, Hospitals, Schools

The Province is reporting an outbreak at Roseway Manor in Shelburne. Two staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. Neither is in hospital or has had contact with residents.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Changements à la façon dont les cas de COVID-19 sont signalés","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Changements à la façon dont les cas de COVID-19 sont signalés
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
À compter d'aujourd'hui 23 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse change la façon dont elle signale les cas de COVID-19 chaque jour en raison des retards dans la saisie des données entraînés par le nombre élevé de cas.

Pendant presque toute la pandémie, la Province a signalé les données du système Panorama, soit le système de renseignements sur les maladies de la Santé publique. Toutefois, depuis le 10 décembre, la Province signale plutôt le nombre de cas confirmés par le laboratoire afin de refléter plus exactement la situation de la COVID-19 dans la province, compte tenu du retard dans la saisie des données dans le système Panorama. Bien que ces données soient plus précises en général, elles contiennent un faible nombre de résultats en double parce que certaines personnes ont subi plus d'un test.

À compter d'aujourd'hui, les résultats en double seront éliminés du nombre de cas signalés. Chaque cas sera compté seulement lorsque la personne obtient son premier résultat positif. La Province continuera de signaler le nombre de cas tous les jours pendant la vague causée par le variant Omicron. Les données publiées du lundi au vendredi incluront le nombre de cas à l'exclusion des résultats en double, le nombre de cas par secteur, le nombre estimé de cas actifs, ainsi que les données sur la vaccination et le dépistage. 

La fin de semaine et les jours de congé, le nombre de cas sera publié selon les données brutes du laboratoire, qui pourraient inclure un faible nombre de résultats en double, ainsi que le nombre de cas par secteur. Les données sur le dépistage seront aussi publiées. Après la fin de semaine ou après un jour de congé, le nombre de cas sera mis en jour après l'exclusion des résultats en double. Le nombre de cas ne sera pas publié le jour de Noël et le jour de l'An.

De plus, à compter d'aujourd'hui, le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19 inclura temporairement le nombre estimé de cas actifs, et certaines données seront éliminées.

Ces changements à la façon dont le nombre de cas est signalé sont temporaires et dureront de quatre à six semaines. Après cette période, la Province recommencera à signaler seulement les données du système Panorama.
 
Faits en bref
-- Une personne peut obtenir plusieurs résultats positifs en laboratoire pour différentes raisons, y compris une série de tests jusqu'à l'obtention d'un résultat négatif aux fins d'un déplacement, ou une série de tests jusqu'à l'obtention d'un résultat négatif aux fins de changements dans la gestion clinique. 
-- Depuis le 15 novembre, 255 résultats positifs étaient des résultats en double.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting today, December 23, Nova Scotia will change how it reports daily COVID-19 data due to delays in data entry caused by the recent high number of cases.

Throughout most of the pandemic, the Province has reported data from Panorama, public health’s disease information system. However, since December 10, the Province has shifted to reporting the number of positive lab test results to more accurately reflect the COVID-19 situation in the province, given the backlog in Panorama data entry. Though this data is more accurate overall, it does contain a small number of duplicate results because some people have been tested more than once.

Starting today, duplicate results will be removed from reported case numbers. Each case will only be counted when the person first tests positive. The Province will continue to report case data daily throughout the Omicron wave. The data released Monday through Friday will include the number of positive cases after excluding duplicate lab results, the breakdown by zone, estimated active case count, and immunization data and testing data. 

On weekends and holidays, the number of positive cases will be reported based on raw lab data, which may include a small number of duplicates, with a breakdown by zone. Testing data will continue to be reported. Following weekends and holidays, the number of cases will be updated with the duplicates removed. There will not be reports on Christmas Day or New Year’s Day.

Also starting today, the COVID-19 dashboard will temporarily include the estimated number of active cases and some data will be removed.

These reporting changes are expected to be temporary and last four to six weeks. The Province will then resume reporting Panorama data.

Quick Facts:
-- a person may have multiple positive lab tests over time for a variety of reasons, including repeat testing until negative if required for travel, or repeat testing until negative in order to make changes in clinical management 
-- since November 15, 255 lab results were repeat positives

REMARQUE : Le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19 ne sera pas mis à jour avant le jeudi 23 décembre. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 22 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Un homme dans la cinquantaine est décédé dans le secteur du nord.

« Je suis attristé d'apprendre le décès d'un autre Néo-Écossais, particulièrement en cette période qui est censée être agréable et joyeuse. J'offre mes plus sincères condoléances à la famille et aux amis qui sont en deuil, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Ce n'est pas le moment de baisser la garde. Cette période des fêtes est différente, car nous devons prendre des mesures pour nous protéger les uns les autres et contenir la propagation de ce virus. Réduisez vos rassemblements, ralentissez et respectez toutes les lignes directrices en matière de santé publique pour protéger vos proches et vos communautés. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 537 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 aujourd'hui.

Il y a 434 cas dans le secteur du centre, 36 dans le secteur de l'est, 44 dans le secteur du nord et 23 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d'un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd'hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d'une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d'isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu'un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l'exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (analysé en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l'on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts (en anglais seulement).

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe ensuite un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu'elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Une mise à jour sur l'approche concernant le dépistage en Nouvelle-Écosse sera bientôt publiée. Les renseignements seront affichés au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus (en anglais seulement). 

Hôpitaux, établissements de soins de longue durée, écoles

La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse signale une éclosion à l'hôpital général de Dartmouth. Moins de cinq patients ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19 et on surveille étroitement tous les patients. Des mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections sont en place, et la Régie teste actuellement tous les patients et tous les employés qui ont été identifiés comme des contacts étroits. La Régie fournira une mise à jour lorsque de plus amples informations seront disponibles.

Un patient supplémentaire a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage à l'hôpital régional St. Martha's d'Antigonish. Le nombre total de cas est toujours inférieur à cinq. Par mesure de précaution, la Régie fait subir un test de dépistage aux contacts étroits qui ont été identifiés et d'autres mesures de prévention et de contrôle des infections sont mises en place. Tous les employés et les médecins de l'établissement qui le souhaitent pourront se faire tester sur place.

Aucun nouveau cas n'est signalé aujourd'hui au Halifax Infirmary du Centre des sciences de la santé QEII. Moins de cinq patients sont touchés par l'éclosion, et tous les patients sont surveillés de près. D'autres mesures de contrôle et de prévention des infections sont mises en place.

Un résident supplémentaire a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage au foyer de soins Parkstone Enhanced Care d'Halifax. En tout, deux résidents et un employé de l'établissement ont contracté la COVID-19. Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés, et tous les résidents admissibles ont reçu une dose de rappel. La Santé publique collabore avec l'établissement pour freiner la transmission. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Un nouveau cas est signalé aujourd'hui chez un résident de l'établissement Parkland d'Antigonish, un établissement résidentiel pour personnes âgées. En tout, trois résidents et deux employés de l'établissement ont contracté la COVID-19. Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés. La Santé publique collabore avec l'établissement pour freiner la transmission. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Aucun nouveau cas lié à l'établissement de soins Ocean View Continuing Care Centre d'Eastern Passage n'est signalé. En tout, trois employés ont contracté la COVID-19. Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et 97 % des résidents sont entièrement vaccinés et 86 % des résidents admissibles ont reçu une dose de rappel. La Santé publique collabore avec l'établissement pour freiner la transmission. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 21 décembre, on a avisé 11 écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Données sur les tests, les hospitalisations et la vaccination

Le 21 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé 7 816 tests.

Dix personnes sont hospitalisées, dont trois aux soins intensifs.

Au 21 décembre, 1 750 383 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 793 214 étaient une deuxième dose, et 98 652 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

NOTE: The online COVID-19 dashboard will not be updated until Thursday, December 23. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 22, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 50s in Northern Zone has died.

“I am saddened to hear about the loss of another Nova Scotian, so close to what is supposed to be a joyful time of year. I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends grieving,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Now is not the time to let our guard down. This holiday season is different as we take steps to protect each other and contain the spread of this virus. Please keep gatherings small, slow down your activities and follow all the public health guidelines to keep our loved ones and communities safe.”

Nova Scotia is also reporting 537 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 434 cases in Central Zone, 36 cases in Eastern Zone, 44 cases in Northern Zone and 23 cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

Further updates to Nova Scotia’s testing approach will be made soon. Information will be posted at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus 

Hospitals, Long-term Care Facilities, Schools

The Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) is reporting an outbreak at Dartmouth General Hospital. Fewer than five patients have tested positive for COVID-19, and all patients are being closely monitored. Infection prevention and control measures are being put in place, and NSHA is currently testing all patients and staff identified as a close contact. NSHA will provide a further update when more information is available.

An additional patient has tested positive at St. Martha’s Regional Hospital in Antigonish. The total number of cases is still fewer than five. As a precaution, NSHA is testing identified close contacts, and other infection prevention and control measures are being put in place. Testing will be made available for all staff and doctors on site who want to get tested.

There are no new cases reported at the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre. There have been fewer than five patients test positive, and all patients are being closely monitored and other infection prevention and control measures are being put in place.

An additional resident at Parkstone Enhanced Care in Halifax has tested positive. A total of two residents and one staff member at the facility have tested positive. No one is in hospital. All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all eligible residents have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

An additional resident at Parkland Antigonish, a seniors’ living community, has tested positive. A total of three residents and two staff members from the retirement home have tested positive. No one is in hospital. All staff and residents are fully vaccinated. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

There are no new cases linked to Ocean View Continuing Care Centre in Eastern Passage. A total of three staff members have tested positive. No one is in hospital. All staff and 97 per cent of residents are fully vaccinated. Eighty-six per cent of eligible residents have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On December 21, 11 schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

Test, Hospitalization, Vaccination Data

On December 21, NSHA’s labs completed 7,816 tests.

Ten people are in hospital, including three in ICU.

As of December 21, 1,750,383 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 793,214 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 98,652 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians who have been impacted by the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic may qualify for up to four paid sick days with the relaunch of Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program.

“We know people are feeling extra stressed at this holiday time, and we want them to know more assistance is coming with the relaunch of this temporary program,” said Premier Tim Houston. “People should continue to do the right thing – just as they did during the third wave – to keep our workplaces safe. Please follow public health protocols and stay home when you are not feeling well.”

People who cannot work remotely and miss less than 50 per cent of their scheduled work time in a one-week period due to COVID-19 may be eligible for the program. Full details, including eligibility for Nova Scotia’s program, will be provided online early in the new year.

Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program is expected to relaunch January 10, 2022, and be in place until March 31, 2022. The program will be retroactive to include sick days starting from December 20, 2021.

The program will again cover employee wages, including wages of self-employed people, up to a maximum of $20 per hour or $160 per day. The maximum payment over the 15-week period is $640 per worker. Eligible businesses that continue to pay their employees during their leave may be reimbursed by the program.

“My team is working diligently to relaunch the program early in the new year while making sure it aligns with the current public health protocols,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “We know how effective we can be against COVID when we work together to develop the right supports for Nova Scotians.”

The program complements the federal Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, which may apply after an employee has been off for 50 per cent or more of their scheduled work week. The federal program runs until May 2022.

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia’s COVID-19 paid sick leave benefit is a voluntary program for workers, businesses and self-employed people
-- the program originally launched May 26, 2021, and covered sick days from May 10 to July 31, 2021
-- about $600,000 was paid out to Nova Scotians and 4,000 sick days were covered
-- the total program cost, including administration, was just under $1 million

Additional Resources:
More information, including details on eligibility requirements, will be posted to the COVID-19 Paid Sick Leave Program website in early January: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/paid-sick-leave-program

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
La Province a élargi l’admissibilité à la dose de rappel du vaccin antiCOVID-19 pour inclure toutes les personnes de 50 ans et plus. 

La dose de rappel est administrée au moins 168 jours après la série vaccinale primaire. Les gens qui ont reçu deux doses du vaccin d'AstraZeneca ou le vaccin Janssen à une dose sont toujours admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel d'un vaccin à base d'ARNm.

Les groupes suivants sont toujours admissibles à une dose de rappel, peu importe l’âge :
-- tous les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne, y compris les fournisseurs de soins de santé qui offrent des soins directs aux patients dans la communauté, 
-- tous les aidants désignés.

On encourage les personnes de moins de 30 ans qui sont admissibles à une dose de rappel à choisir le vaccin de Pfizer. Le risque rare de myocardite et de péricardite associé aux vaccins à base d'ARNm est plus élevé avec le vaccin de Moderna qu’avec celui de Pfizer.

Les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne et les fournisseurs de soins de santé dans la communauté devront présenter une preuve de leur désignation et on les encourage à avoir leur permis professionnel, leur carte d'identité pour le travail ou une lettre de leur employeur lors de leur rendez-vous. Les fournisseurs sont :
-- les médecins, les infirmières et les auxiliaires en soins continus qui travaillent en pratique communautaire ou qui assurent des soins à domicile;
-- les dentistes, les assistants dentaires, les hygiénistes dentaires et les denturologistes;
-- les pharmaciens, les assistants en pharmacie et les techniciens en pharmacie.

Toute personne admissible à recevoir une dose de rappel peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou en composant le numéro sans frais 1-833-797-7772.

On encourage les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à être patients si un rendez-vous n’est pas disponible immédiatement dans leur région. Des rendez-vous sont ajoutés de manière continue dans les cliniques de la province. 

Faits en bref
-- Aujourd'hui 22 décembre, plus de 270 000 personnes de 50 ans ou plus sont admissibles à prendre rendez-vous pour leur dose de rappel.
-- La Province ajoutera 75 000 rendez-vous de plus cette semaine pour janvier.

The Province has expanded eligibility for COVID-19 booster doses to include anyone 50 years of age and older. 

Booster doses are administered at least 168 days after the primary series. People who received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine or the one-dose Janssen vaccine are still eligible to schedule a booster dose of mRNA vaccine.

The following groups are still eligible for a booster dose regardless of age:
-- all frontline healthcare workers, including community healthcare providers who provide direct patient care
-- all designated caregivers

People under age 30 who are eligible for a booster are encouraged to get the Pfizer vaccine. The rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with mRNA vaccines is higher with the Moderna vaccine than Pfizer.

Frontline and community healthcare providers should be prepared to provide proof of designation and are encouraged to bring their professional licence, work identification or letter from their employer to their appointment. Providers include:
-- doctors, nurses, and continuing care assistants who work in community practice or provide care in the home
-- dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists and denturists
-- pharmacists, pharmacy assistants and pharmacy technicians.

Anyone eligible for a booster dose can schedule an appointment online at https://novascotia.ca/vaccination or by calling the toll-free line: 1-833-797-7772.

Nova Scotians are encouraged to be patient if an appointment is not immediately available in their local area. Appointments are continually added to clinics across the province. 

Quick Facts:
-- as of today, December 22, more than 270,000 Nova Scotians age 50 and older are eligible to schedule their booster dose
-- the Province will open 75,000 more appointments this week for January

Le 20 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 10 201 tests.

Dix personnes sont hospitalisées, dont trois aux soins intensifs.

Le 20 décembre, on a avisé neuf écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures. 

Au 20 décembre, 1 740 158 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 792 848 sont une deuxième dose, et 90 369 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Peu importe votre statut vaccinal, si vous présentez des symptômes, vous devez vous isoler immédiatement et consulter le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour faire une auto-évaluation et prendre rendez-vous pour passer un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Conseils au sujet des tests pour les personnes asymptomatiques

Pour savoir si vous devez passer un test de dépistage même si vous êtes asymptomatique, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). Les personnes qui ne répondent pas à ces critères peuvent passer un test rapide dans une clinique temporaire ou une unité mobile. Les emplacements sont indiqués au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing (en anglais seulement).

Les personnes à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elles étaient des contacts étroits d’un cas positif ou qu’elles étaient dans un des endroits figurant à la liste des endroits où il y a eu exposition au virus de la COVID-19 doivent s’isoler immédiatement et surveiller leurs symptômes, même si elles sont entièrement vaccinées. Elles doivent aussi prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR 72 heures après l’exposition.

Si le résultat du test est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle est entièrement vaccinée. Si le résultat du test est positif, elle doit poursuivre son isolement et suivre les directives de la Santé publique qui se trouvent en ligne.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
La Province renforce les restrictions concernant le port du masque, les rassemblements et l'éloignement physique afin de protéger le système de soins de santé et d'autres secteurs essentiels contre le variant Omicron de la COVID-19.

« Nous ne voulions pas imposer plus de restrictions juste avant la période des fêtes. Toutefois, même si les symptômes de la maladie sont légers, la propagation exponentielle du variant Omicron présente une menace aux secteurs essentiels tels que les soins de santé, les services policiers et les services ambulanciers, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Ces restrictions supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour faire en sorte que nous ralentissions tous, que nous réduisions nos contacts sociaux et que nous limitions les occasions pour le virus de se propager. Vous devrez peut-être organiser un repas de Noël plus petit que prévu, mais mieux vaut prévenir que guérir. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse a annoncé 2 590 cas de COVID-19 depuis le 15 décembre, y compris les chiffres quotidiens les plus élevés depuis le début de la pandémie.

« En plus de protéger les secteurs essentiels, il faut limiter le nombre d'hospitalisations. Nous avons plusieurs hospitalisations supplémentaires en Nouvelle-Écosse, et nous voyons des tendances inquiétantes dans d'autres régions, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Avec un nombre de cas aussi élevé, même un faible pourcentage de maladie grave pourrait surcharger nos hôpitaux. Nous devons prendre ces mesures maintenant pour protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables et maintenir un système de soins de santé fonctionnel au cours des prochaines semaines. »

Les restrictions suivantes remplacent la liste publiée la semaine dernière et sont en vigueur à compter de 6 h le mercredi 22 décembre. Elles resteront en place au moins jusqu'au 12 janvier et seront réévaluées à cette date.

Exigences en matière d'éloignement physique et du port du masque

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Further Provincewide Restrictions to Slow Omicron Variant","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Further Provincewide Restrictions to Slow Omicron Variant 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is strengthening restrictions around masking, gatherings and physical distancing to protect the healthcare system and other critical workforces from the threat of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

“We did not want to impose more restrictions on Nova Scotians leading into the holidays. But even if illness remains mild, the exponential spread of the Omicron variant is threatening critical workforces like healthcare, fire, police and paramedics,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We need further restrictions to ensure everyone slows down, reins in their socializing, and limits opportunities for the virus to spread. It may mean a smaller Christmas dinner than you’d planned, but it’s better to be small and safe.”

Nova Scotia has announced 2,590 new cases of COVID-19 since December 15, including the highest daily totals since the pandemic started.

“In addition to protecting critical workforces, we have several new hospitalizations in Nova Scotia and we’re seeing concerning trends in other jurisdictions,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “With high case numbers, even a very small percentage with severe illness could overload our hospitals. We need to take these steps now to protect those who are most vulnerable and maintain a functional healthcare system in the weeks ahead.”

The updated restrictions below replace the list released last week and are effective at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, December 22. They will be in place until at least January 12 and will be re-evaluated then.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","522 New Cases of COVID-19, Long-Term Care Cases, Two Hospital Outbreaks","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--522 New Cases of COVID-19, Long-Term Care Cases, Two Hospital Outbreaks
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 21, Nova Scotia is reporting 522 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 382 cases in Central Zone, 59 cases in Eastern Zone, 38 cases in Northern Zone and 43 cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

The Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) is reporting an outbreak at the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre. Currently there are a very low number of patients impacted (less than five), and all patients are being closely monitored and other infection prevention and control measures are being put in place. NSHA will provide a further update when more information is available. 

NSHA is also reporting an outbreak at St. Martha’s Regional Hospital in Antigonish (also less than five patients). As a precaution, NSHA is testing identified close contacts. Testing will be made available for all staff and doctors on site who want to get tested. 

The Province is reporting cases linked to Ocean View Continuing Care Centre in Eastern Passage. Three staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. No one is in hospital. All staff and 97 per cent of residents are fully vaccinated. Eighty-six per cent of eligible residents have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place. 

There are no new cases reported at Parkstone Enhanced Care in Halifax. A total of one resident and one staff member at the facility have tested positive for COVID-19. No one is in hospital. All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all eligible residents have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place. 

On December 20, NSHA's labs completed 10,201 tests.

Ten people are in hospital, including three in ICU.

On December 20, nine schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of December 20, 1,740,158 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 792,848 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 90,369 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing Advice

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Regardless of vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment. They should also book a COVID-19 test if, in the past 48 hours, they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms but should get tested are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet any of the criteria for asymptomatic testing can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Rapid test locations are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact of a positive case or if they were at a site listed in a COVID-19 exposure notification should isolate immediately and monitor for symptoms, even if fully vaccinated. They should also book a PCR test for 72 hours after the exposure.

If the test result is negative, people can stop isolating if fully vaccinated. If it is positive, they should continue isolating and follow the public health direction that’s online.

"Finance and Treasury Board","Second 2021-22 Budget Update","FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD--Second 2021-22 Budget Update
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second update on Budget 2021-22 shows signs that Nova Scotia’s overall economy has been recovering despite continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This better-than-expected economic performance has had a positive impact on revenue, allowing the government to make investments in its priority areas.

Finance and Treasury Board Minister Allan MacMaster presented the update today, December 21, which forecasts a surplus of $108.2 million for the 2021-22 fiscal year. This is a $693.2-million change from the $584.9-million deficit presented in March and a $552.8-million change from the September forecast.

“With the recent increase in case numbers and the Omicron variant, we know that Nova Scotia, like the rest of the world, is still in a period of uncertainty,” said Minister MacMaster. “Although revenues were much higher than we expected, prudent fiscal management will allow us to continue to fight the pandemic and rebuild our economy by investing in key areas like healthcare, seniors, housing and the environment.”

Finance and Treasury Board provides budget updates to the public three times a year in September, December and as a final forecast with the following year’s budget. The final report on the budget is presented through public accounts in the summer.

Quick Facts:
-- total revenue is projected to be $12.8 billion, up $1.0 billion from budget, mainly due to higher personal income tax, HST revenues, Canada Health Transfer and Offshore Accord payments, as well as one-time prior year adjustments of $349.1 million
-- departmental expenses are projected to be $11.9 billion, up $429.2 million from budget, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and additional investments in government priority areas
-- additional appropriations totalling $97.1 million are required for seven departments and offices

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","485 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, éclosion dans un établissement de soins de longue durée","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--485 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, éclosion dans un établissement de soins de longue durée
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 20 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 485 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 317 cas dans le secteur du centre, 57 dans le secteur de l'est, 36 dans le secteur du nord et 75 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d'un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd'hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d'une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d'isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu'un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l'exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (analysé en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l'on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts (en anglais seulement).

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe ensuite un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu'elle est entièrement vaccinée.

La Province signale une éclosion à l'établissement Parkstone Enhanced Care à Halifax. Un résident et un membre du personnel ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés, et tous les résidents admissibles ont reçu une dose de rappel. La Santé publique collabore avec l'établissement pour freiner la transmission. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées. 

Le 19 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 9 198 tests.

Neuf personnes sont hospitalisées, dont deux aux soins intensifs.

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé 28 écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Au 19 décembre, 1 731 205 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 792 552 étaient une deuxième dose, et 83 071 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Peu importe votre statut vaccinal, si vous présentez des symptômes, vous devez vous isoler immédiatement et consulter le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour faire une auto-évaluation et prendre rendez-vous pour passer un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Conseils au sujet des tests pour les personnes asymptomatiques

Pour savoir si vous devez passer un test de dépistage même si vous êtes asymptomatique, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). Les personnes qui ne répondent pas à ces critères peuvent passer un test rapide dans une clinique temporaire ou une unité mobile.  Les emplacements sont indiqués au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing (en anglais seulement).

Les personnes à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elles étaient des contacts étroits d'un cas positif ou qu'elles étaient dans un des endroits figurant à la liste des endroits où il y a eu exposition au virus de la COVID-19 doivent s'isoler immédiatement et surveiller leurs symptômes, même si elles sont entièrement vaccinées. Elles doivent aussi prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR 72 heures après l'exposition.

Si le résultat du test est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle est entièrement vaccinée. Si le résultat du test est positif, elle doit poursuivre son isolement et suivre les directives de la Santé publique qui se trouvent en ligne.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","485 New Cases of COVID-19, Long-Term Care Outbreak","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--485 New Cases of COVID-19, Long-Term Care Outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 20, Nova Scotia is reporting 485 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 317 cases in Central Zone, 57 cases in Eastern Zone, 36 cases in Northern Zone and 75 cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

The Province is reporting an outbreak at Parkstone Enhanced Care in Halifax. One resident and one staff member have tested positive for COVID-19. No one is in hospital. All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all eligible residents have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place. 

On December 19, Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 9,198 tests.

Nine people are in hospital, including two in ICU.

Over the past three days, 28 schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of December 19, 1,731,205 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 792,552 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 83,071 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing Advice

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Regardless of vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment. They should also book a COVID-19 test if, in the past 48 hours, they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms but should get tested are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet any of the criteria for asymptomatic testing can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Rapid test locations are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact of a positive case or if they were at a site listed in a COVID-19 exposure notification should isolate immediately and monitor for symptoms, even if fully vaccinated. They should also book a PCR test for 72 hours after the exposure.

If the test result is negative, people can stop isolating if fully vaccinated. If it is positive, they should continue isolating and follow the public health direction that’s online.

"Premier's Office / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Help Wanted: Province Launches Recruitment Campaign to Increase Workers in Healthcare, Trades","PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Help Wanted: Province Launches Recruitment Campaign to Increase Workers in Healthcare, Trades
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Nova Scotia’s population passes the one million mark, the Province is launching a recruitment campaign to increase workers in healthcare and the skilled trades to support labour market needs.   

The campaign is part of a larger strategy to double the current population to two million people by 2060 – adding an average of 25,000 more people to Nova Scotia each year.

“Nova Scotia is no longer a ‘best kept secret’ – people are realizing this is one of the best places on earth to live and work,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Our population is growing at record rates. We want healthcare workers and skilled tradespeople to know there’s both a great life and a great job waiting for them. I invite them to come to Nova Scotia and see for themselves.”

To support this growth, Nova Scotia is creating a team of navigators to connect healthcare professionals and tradespeople with the information they need to support their move here. The Province will return provincial taxes on the first $50,000 of income for workers aged 30 years and under in designated trades.

The Province is also launching a targeted campaign to promote Nova Scotia’s growing job opportunities. It will include TV, radio, billboard, and all forms of digital advertising.

“We are unabashedly asking for workers in the trades and in healthcare to make Nova Scotia their home,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “We are an energetic, innovative province that welcomes ideas and contributions from all. For those just starting out in their careers, we offer financial incentives to attract young people and a lifestyle that’s sure to get them to stay. And we have opportunities in other sectors as well.  Everyone is welcome.”

The Department of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage is also relaunching the successful Work from Nova Scotia campaign from 2020-21. It encourages Canadians who work remotely to relocate or come to Nova Scotia for longer stays, highlighting the province’s communities, coastal lifestyle and world-class experiences.

Quotes:
“There is truly no better place to work, study, live and raise a family. As Nova Scotia continues to grow, we’ll continue to target and encourage the workforce we need to support that growth – that’s how everyone thrives.”
     - Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage

“As a private operator in seniors’ care, specifically long-term care, we were very encouraged by the announced investment in recruitment to Nova Scotia. We have welcomed nearly 500 families to Nova Scotia over the last 10 years. This additional investment means we get to continue bringing skilled nurses from around the world to join our growing global community.”
     - Mahmood Hussain, Director, People Relations, GEM Health Care Group

“We’re entering a period of unprecedented growth in the construction sector just as many of our people are reaching retirement. Nova Scotia has billions of infrastructure and housing in development, and that’s going to require a lot more people in the trades: at least 11,000 certified tradespeople in the next eight years.”
     - Duncan Williams, President and CEO, Construction Association of NS

“In the construction industry, and electrical in particular, we’re seeing increased demand across all areas of our business – from commercial and government projects to houses and service work. We hire people locally and from abroad to help satisfy the workload, and the fact is, we need more.”
     - Evan Henderson, President, Henderson Electrical Installations Ltd.

Quick Facts:
-- according to Statistics Canada, Nova Scotia’s population as of December 16 was more than one million people
-- Nova Scotia's population growth in the third quarter of 2021 reached a record level due to both international and interprovincial migration; from July 1 to October 31, the population grew 6,777– the fastest quarterly growth in records dating back to 1971
-- Halifax is rated No. 1 in Maclean’s magazine’s 2021 ranking of Canada’s best communities (out of 415 communities across the country)

"Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services","Illegal Vape Products Seized in Halifax Regional Municipality and Truro","SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES--Illegal Vape Products Seized in Halifax Regional Municipality and Truro
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Illegal vape products have been taken off the streets of Nova Scotia following an investigation by the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services’ compliance and special investigations unit.

On November 17, with the assistance of Halifax Regional Police and Truro Police, the compliance and special investigations unit searched four VaporHub vape shop locations in Halifax, Dartmouth, Lower Sackville and Truro. They seized 51,000 millilitres (51 litres) of illegal vape juice, valued at $70,000. The illegal products consisted of flavoured vape juice, products with nicotine amounts over the legal limit, and intentionally mislabeled products.

“Keeping illegal vaping products off the streets is about keeping it out of the hands of our youth,” said Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services Minister Colton LeBlanc. “These products and nicotine addiction can have serious effects on the health of our youth and we are committed to working with law enforcement to keep it off the streets.”

The estimated provincial tax value of the seizure is $25,000.

VaporHub Inc. is scheduled to appear in court at several locations in late January to face charges under the Tobacco Access Act.

Since January 1, 2021, Service Nova Scotia and Internal Service’s compliance and special investigations unit has conducted 29 seizures and seized 430,000 ml (430 litres) of illegal e-juice with a retail value of about $605,000 and a tax value of $215,000. A large amount of this product was flavoured with high levels of nicotine which is attractive to youth.

Anyone with information about the sale and manufacturing of illegal vape or tobacco products is asked to contact their local police or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

Quick Facts:
-- on April 1, 2020, Nova Scotia became one of the first provinces to announce measures to address vaping and the only province to announce a full flavour ban
-- Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services, through its audit and enforcement section of the alcohol, gaming, fuel and tobacco division, is responsible for reducing illegal vape and tobacco products in Nova Scotia by working with its law enforcement partners, and through education and enforcement

"Health and Wellness / Public Works","Work Underway at IWK Emergency Department Expansion Site","PUBLIC WORKS/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Work Underway at IWK Emergency Department Expansion Site
----------------------------------------------------------------
Work has started on the IWK Health Centre’s new emergency department, which will more than double its current size.

“Expanding the IWK’s emergency department is an exciting step forward,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “This project will mean a larger, more modern facility for patients, families, physicians and staff, and will also ensure the IWK continues to meet the standards of care that it is well known for around the Maritimes.” 

The new emergency department will be built on University Avenue in Halifax next to the existing parking garage near the front of the Children's Building. The current emergency department is on the opposite side of the complex on South Street.

The new department will help address the increase in patients being seen at the emergency department and meet new infection prevention and control measures. It will also meet future needs in support of the government’s goal of doubling Nova Scotia’s population by 2060.

The estimated cost of the project is $102 million. It will serve children and families from all three Maritime provinces for the next 50 years with a priority on a patient-focused experience.

EllisDon was awarded the construction manager contract for the IWK Emergency Expansion Project. The project is anticipated to be completed by March 2025.

Quotes:
“The IWK’s renovation project is more than an infrastructure project. It will enhance Nova Scotians’ access to care and will provide a healthier, safer environment for patients and staff.”
     - Kim Masland, Minister of Public Works

“The new emergency department will allow the IWK to modernize patient flow and improve patient care experiences. The design will allow enhanced infection prevention and control, as well as privacy for patients and families from triage and throughout their stay.”
     - Dr. Katrina Hurley, Chief, IWK Emergency Medicine

“The government’s commitment to the construction of the emergency department at the IWK, purpose-built to meet the physical and mental health needs for children and youth, will ensure our healthcare providers are able to meet the evolving needs of Maritime families by providing the highest level of care for years to come.”
     - Dr. Krista Jangaard, President and CEO, IWK Health

Quick Facts:
-- over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in patient visits, with the department seeing a 28 per cent increase in patient volume this fall compared to the same period in 2019
-- on average each day, there are 1,020 outpatient/clinic visits, 90-100 emergency visits and 20 surgeries at the IWK

The Department of Natural Resources and Renewables is investing another $57 million to expand energy efficiency programming for homes and businesses across the province.

“Nova Scotia is transitioning to a clean, more renewable energy future,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “We know that upgrading buildings to become more energy efficient reduces energy bills and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. We’re pleased to expand our investment.”

The majority of the funding, $50 million, will be focused on residential energy efficiency programs to address energy poverty and equity. The remaining $7 million is for energy efficiency programming for businesses.

The Department will work with partner organizations to finalize program details. More information will be shared in the new year.

Quotes:
“Mitigating the devastating impacts of climate change requires urgent action and Efficiency Nova Scotia has been widely recognized for its success as a single-administrator, one-window approach for efficiency services, supporting local jobs and contributing to a more sustainable province. Investments in energy efficiency are proven to be the fastest and lowest cost approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while lowering energy bills for Nova Scotians and reducing energy poverty.”
     - Stephen MacDonald, President and CEO of EfficiencyOne, the non-profit operator of Efficiency Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- this funding is added to the $42 million already provided in 2021-22 to energy efficiency programs
-- energy efficiency programs are saving Nova Scotians more than $1.4 billion in energy costs
-- the programs are helping low-income homeowners and renters save over $260 million on their energy bills
-- 25 per cent of Nova Scotia’s greenhouse gas emission reductions are attributable to energy efficiency programs
-- the growing energy efficiency industry has created over 2,500 jobs across Nova Scotia

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : La Nouvelle-Écosse publie un communiqué abrégé au sujet de la COVID-19 aujourd'hui. Le tableau de bord en ligne ne sera pas mis à jour.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 19 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 476 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 333 cas dans le secteur du centre, 82 dans le secteur de l'est, 43 dans le secteur du nord et 18 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d’un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd’hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d’une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d’isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu’un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l’exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (analysé en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l’on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts. 

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe ensuite un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu’elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Le 18 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 8 837 tests.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","476 New Cases of COVID-19","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--476 New Cases of COVID-19
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Nova Scotia is issuing an abbreviated COVID-19 news release today. The online dashboard will not be updated.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 19, Nova Scotia is reporting 476 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 333 cases in Central Zone, 82 cases in Eastern Zone, 43 cases in Northern Zone and 18 cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

On December 18, Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 8,837 tests.

Testing Advice

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Regardless of vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment. They should also book a COVID-19 test if, in the past 48 hours, they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms but should get tested are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet any of the criteria for asymptomatic testing can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Rapid test locations are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact of a positive case or if they were at a site listed in a COVID-19 exposure notification should isolate immediately and monitor for symptoms, even if fully vaccinated. They should also book a PCR test for 72 hours after the exposure.

If the test result is negative, people can stop isolating if fully vaccinated. If it is positive, they should continue isolating and follow the public health direction that’s online.

REMARQUE : La Nouvelle-Écosse publie un communiqué abrégé au sujet de la COVID-19 aujourd'hui et dimanche. Le tableau de bord en ligne ne sera pas mis à jour.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 18 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 426 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 296 cas dans le secteur du centre, 70 dans le secteur de l'est, 35 dans le secteur du nord et 25 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d’un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd’hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d’une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d’isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu’un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l’exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (analysé en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l’on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts. 

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe ensuite un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu’elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Le 17 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 8 996 tests.

The Province announced today, December 17, additional support for Nova Scotia businesses impacted by the new provincewide public health restrictions.

The Sector Impact Support Program will provide a one-time grant of up to $7,500 to help small business owners in industries such as restaurants, bars, gyms, live performing arts facilities and recreation facilities.

“With the rise in positive cases and the threat of the Omicron variant, we know these public health restrictions are necessary to help keep Nova Scotians safe,” said Premier Tim Houston. “But we also know these restrictions will have a significant impact on many businesses during what would typically be a busy time of year. That’s why we need to support our business sector and position ourselves for recovery as quickly as possible.”

The Sector Impact Support Program will be funded through the Nova Scotia COVID-19 Response Council. It is expected to cost about $10 million depending on participation.

Applications will open in early January. Eligible businesses can receive the following amounts based on November 2021 gross payroll costs:

-- payroll costs between $15,001 and $25,000 – grant of $5,000
-- payroll costs between $25,001 or more – grant of $7,500.

Quick Facts:
-- the program will be available to: restaurants offering in-person dining service; bars and other licensed drinking establishments; fitness, recreational and leisure facilities including gyms, yoga studios, indoor play areas, arcades, climbing facilities, dance programs and music lessons; boat and walking tours; private museums; rinks and arenas that are not municipally owned; and live performing arts facilities
-- businesses must be registered in Nova Scotia as a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, society, social enterprise, not-for-profit, charity in business, or other similar organization; have an active CRA Business Number (BN); and have gross revenue of $5 million or less in its most recently completed tax year

Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu'elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Le 16 décembre, on a avisé 16 écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures. 

Il y a eu 256 cas de COVID-19 dont l'épisode est survenu entre le 9 et le 16 décembre. De ce nombre : 

-- 172 personnes (67,2 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 6 personnes (2,3 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 78 personnes (30,5 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

Il y a eu 7 381 cas du 15 mars au 16 décembre. De ce nombre :

En tout, 63 399 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 10 au 16 décembre. Cela comprend 5 618 tests de dépistage rapide dans les cliniques temporaires d'Halifax et de Dartmouth, et 57 781 tests rapides administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. De plus, 66 992 tests rapides à faire à la maison ont été distribués dans les cliniques temporaires, 400 000 ont été distribuées dans les bibliothèques et 167 000 ont été distribués aux enfants de la prématernelle à la 6e année dans les écoles publiques. On a également distribué 60 000 tests aux partenaires communautaires pour les enfants de 3 à 11 ans qui ne fréquentent pas les écoles publiques.

Today, December 17, Nova Scotia is reporting 394 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 295 cases in Central Zone, 54 cases in Eastern Zone, 27 cases in Northern Zone and 18 cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms but should get tested are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet any of the criteria for asymptomatic testing can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Rapid test locations are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact of a positive case or if they were at a site listed in a COVID-19 exposure notification should isolate immediately and monitor for symptoms, even if fully vaccinated. They should also book a PCR test for 72 hours after the exposure.

If the test result is negative, people can stop isolating if fully vaccinated. If it is positive, they should continue isolating and follow the public health direction that’s online.

"Community Services / L'nu Affairs","Minister's Statement on the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre","COMMUNITY SERVICES/L’NU AFFAIRS--Minister's Statement on the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a statement from Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services and Minister of L'nu Affairs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I am deeply saddened by the decision of the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre to close the North Park Street shelter on December 31. The centre remains a valuable partner.

We are always focused on the safety and well-being of homeless individuals staying in shelters, and we recognize culturally safe places play a critical role in reducing harm.

The Department of Community Services will work collaboratively with the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre to transfer people to a hotel where they will receive supports to help them move into the community once ready. The $850,000 that was committed to flow to the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre emergency shelter will instead now be directed toward the hotel costs.

In addition, the Province recently announced $1.6 million for the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre to operate the Diamond Bailey House. An additional $76,000 will be provided in the first year for start-up costs. The Diamond Bailey House is expected to open in the spring.

Our first concern is always the well-being of the clients we serve. The Department of Community Services will continue to move quickly with a variety of interventions and supports to ensure those who need help receive it.

"Premier's Office / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Successful Atlantic Immigration Pilot Made Permanent","PREMIER’S OFFICE/LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Successful Atlantic Immigration Pilot Made Permanent
-----------------------------------------------------------------
After five years as a highly successful pilot program, the Atlantic Immigration Program is now a permanent pathway for designated employers to hire skilled workers. The Province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada announced the permanent program today, December 17.

The Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program was launched in 2017 under the Atlantic Growth Strategy with a goal to help employers hire foreign skilled workers and international graduates for vacancies they could not fill locally.

“We’re so pleased the Government of Canada has made this program permanent so we can continue this good work,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Incredibly, 4,485 people came to Nova Scotia as a result of the AIP pilot. This growth has been vital for our province and the rest of Atlantic Canada. The new Atlantic Immigration Program will be the next chapter for Nova Scotia as we work to our goal of becoming two million strong by 2060.”

Under the permanent program, employers can hire immigrant talent once they have demonstrated that they have attempted to find workers through domestic recruitment. International skilled workers and international students can move to or study and stay in Nova Scotia with a job and settlement support for them and their family. Designated employers are required to participate in new intercultural competency training to further support the creation of welcoming workplaces and help with international retention.

“The permanency of this program is a big opportunity for our province,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “The Atlantic Immigration Program is another tool that employers can use to fill labour gaps as they work to grow their businesses and fuel the provincial economy. We are excited to welcome skilled newcomers to our province and show them everything Nova Scotia has to offer.”

When it comes into effect in the new year, the permanent program will be modernized with a digital application system to improve processing times and reduce red tape for businesses. These enhanced program features will reduce barriers to accessing immigration programs and support greater employer participation.

The Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration continues to be innovative and responsive to current and emerging labour needs and is committed to working with employers, the public sector and other partners to ensure Nova Scotia has immigration programs that benefit employers, Nova Scotians and communities.

Quotes:
“Staffing is the most significant challenge facing long-term care and seniors’ living in this province and we have had great success recruiting new team members through the Atlantic Immigration Pilot. Our newcomers have been a welcome addition to our homes and quickly establish themselves as skilled, hard working and generous colleagues and members of the greater community.”
     - Jason Shannon, President and Chief Operating Officer, Shannex

Quick Facts:
-- since the launch in 2017, 4,485 people came through the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program to live and work in Nova Scotia
-- the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program has promoted more regional immigration in Nova Scotia, with about 40 per cent of designated businesses located outside of the Halifax Regional Municipality
-- from January 1 to April 1, 2021, 5,696 people moved to Nova Scotia from other countries and other parts of Canada, and the province’s population grew by 2,877 – the largest increase in the first quarter since 1971
-- Nova Scotia’s current immigrant retention rate is 71 per cent, the highest in Atlantic Canada

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","287 nouveaux cas de COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--287 nouveaux cas de COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 16 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 287 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 191 cas dans le secteur du centre, 57 dans le secteur de l'est, 24 dans le secteur du nord et 15 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d’un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd’hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d’une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d’isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu’un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l’exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (analysé en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l’on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts . 

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe ensuite un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu’elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Aucun nouveau cas n’a été signalé aujourd’hui à l’établissement Parkland d’Antigonish, un établissement résidentiel pour personnes âgées. Deux résidents et deux membres du personnel de cette résidence ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage, et un employé de Mary’s Court, la communauté de soins de longue durée, a aussi reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage. Personne n'est hospitalisé.

Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés, et tous les résidents de Mary’s Court ont reçu une dose de rappel. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour freiner la propagation du virus. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 15 décembre, on a avisé neuf écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures .  

Le 15 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 7 852 tests.

Six personnes sont hospitalisées, dont deux aux soins intensifs. Personne n’est hospitalisé dans le secteur de l’est.

Au 15 décembre, 1 708 855 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 791 766 sont une deuxième dose, et 66 461 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Peu importe votre statut vaccinal, si vous présentez des symptômes, vous devez vous isoler immédiatement et consulter le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour faire une auto-évaluation  et prendre rendez-vous pour passer un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Conseils au sujet des tests pour les personnes asymptomatiques

Pour savoir si vous devez passer un test de dépistage même si vous êtes asymptomatique, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement).  Les personnes qui ne répondent pas à ces critères peuvent passer un test rapide dans une clinique temporaire ou une unité mobile. Les emplacements sont indiqués au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing (en anglais seulement).

Les personnes à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elles étaient des contacts étroits d’un cas positif ou qu’elles étaient dans un des endroits figurant à la liste des endroits où il y a eu exposition au virus de la COVID-19 doivent s’isoler immédiatement et surveiller leurs symptômes, même si elles sont entièrement vaccinées. Elles doivent aussi prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR 72 heures après l’exposition.

Si le resultat du test est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle est entièrement vaccinée. Si le résultat du test est positif, elle doit poursuivre son isolement et suivre les directives de la Santé publique qui se trouvent en ligne.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 16, Nova Scotia is reporting 287 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 191 cases in Central Zone, 57 cases in Eastern Zone, 24 cases in Northern Zone and 15 cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

There are no new cases reported today at Parkland Antigonish, a seniors’ living community. Two residents and two staff members from the retirement home have tested positive and one staff member from Mary’s Court, the licensed long-term care neighbourhood, has tested positive. No one is in hospital.

All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all residents of Mary’s Court have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On December 15, nine schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

On December 15, Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 7,852 tests.

Six people are in hospital, including two in ICU. There are no hospitalizations in Eastern Zone.

As of December 15, 1,708,855 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 791,766 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 66,461 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

"Premier's Office","Nova Scotia Reaches One Million Population Milestone","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Nova Scotia Reaches One Million Population Milestone
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia marks a major population milestone as the province surpasses one million people, following record growth since July 2021.

“Reaching the one million mark is a significant moment in our province’s history. After years of a declining population, the world is learning how special Nova Scotia is; we have momentum and are growing,” said Premier Tim Houston. “More people make us stronger in every way. We all benefit from this growth with a greater tax base, new businesses and jobs, greater diversity and culture and improved infrastructure. I ask our citizens, employers, communities, schools and workplaces to open their arms to new Nova Scotians and provide a warm welcome to all who choose our spectacular province as their home.”

A key priority for government, as identified in Ministers’ mandate letters, is economic growth. In collaboration across the government, with businesses, communities and other stakeholders, the Province is working to attract and retain more young people, entrepreneurs and skilled workers who deliver essential services such as healthcare, education and construction.

Immigration has played a large part in growing the population in Nova Scotia. The Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration continues to work with employers to find innovative ways to respond to current and emerging needs in occupations where there are shortages and help to streamline the immigration process.

To grow Nova Scotia’s population to two million by 2060, the Province aims to attract 25,000 newcomers per year through a combination of migration from other parts of Canada and strategic immigration efforts.

While Canada’s real-time population clock website is currently offline, Statistics Canada’s The Daily report for today, December 16, indicates Nova Scotia has surpassed one million.

Quotes: 
“Nova Scotia is steadily growing, and we want to encourage those living across the country and around the world to build a life in our beautiful province. With a growing population comes increased opportunities. Newcomers fuel our economy, fill labour gaps and enrich our communities. We look forward to welcoming new people to Nova Scotia with open arms and experiencing the benefits of newcomers in all parts of the province.”
     - Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration

“Since moving here from Israel in 2020, I've rejoiced again and again over the spectacular natural beauty that is literally around every corner in Nova Scotia. But most of all, I love the people here. They are sincere, kind, friendly, with a lot of sensitivity to others' emotions and a genuine willingness to help anyone. That is the real treasure of our province.”
     - Bridgewater resident Sasha Raz

Starting in February, IWK surgeons and anesthesiologists will perform some less-complex procedures at Scotia Surgery in Dartmouth, with the clinic’s nurses. This 13-month initiative has the potential to significantly reduce the COVID-19 pandemic-related backlog for pediatric surgery.

“This government committed to finding solutions for Nova Scotians waiting months and years for surgery,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We need to use every available resource we have right now to address wait times for pediatric surgeries and this trial with Scotia Surgery will provide IWK surgeons and anesthesiologists a space to be able to do their jobs and provide care for those who need it now.”

Scotia Surgery operating rooms will be used for patients in need of non-complex, elective, outpatient surgeries, such as urology, orthopedic, plastic and dental procedures. It will free up space and resources at the IWK to allow more operating room time for procedures that can only be done in the main operating room, such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, spinal surgery or surgeries for patients with complex needs.

This partnership represents an investment of $1.16 million, covered through the IWK’s internal funding. An evaluation in March 2023 when the trial is complete will inform any future action.

Quotes: 
“Surgical wait times have gotten too long, and we need to get creative to address the issue. Children shouldn’t have to wait so long for these surgeries. This partnership allows patients to get the same high quality of care the IWK is known for sooner by using the Scotia Surgery facility.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“This partnership with Scotia Surgery will increase our operating room capacity and will be an important part of reducing surgical wait times for children across the Maritimes.”
     - Dr. Gerard Corsten, Chief, Pediatric Surgery, IWK Health

“We are pleased to partner with the IWK to help expedite outpatient surgeries.  We have partnered with the Nova Scotia Health Authority in a similar manner for over a decade now to effectively help reduce wait times and believe this initiative will help deliver the government’s promise to further reduce wait times.”
     -  Dr. Philip Cyr, CEO, Scotia Surgery 

Quick Facts:
-- IWK Health provides surgical services for more than 4,900 Nova Scotian and Maritime children and youth each year
-- on average each day, there are 1,020 outpatient/clinic visits, 90-100 emergency visits and 20 surgeries at the IWK

"Public Works","Cobequid Pass Tolls Eliminated for Nova Scotia-Registered Vehicles","PUBLIC WORKS--Cobequid Pass Tolls Eliminated for Nova Scotia-Registered Vehicles
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Effective today, December 16, at 11 a.m., the Province eliminated tolls for Nova Scotia-registered vehicles using the Cobequid Pass highway.

“Our government promised to remove tolls on the Cobequid Pass, and today it became a reality,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Tolls will remain for non-Nova Scotia passenger and commercial vehicles, ensuring that we keep this important transportation corridor maintained to the highest standard.”

At this time, there are no plans to increase tolls.

Nova Scotia motorists who do not have the transponder that allows vehicles to pass through the toll lanes without stopping will still need to stop at a booth to prove their vehicle is registered in the province. People who want a transponder can apply for one at https://www.cobequidpass.com/login and it will be mailed to them, free of charge, providing them an easier and quicker passage through the toll plaza.

There are currently no plans for physical changes to the toll plaza or the approaches to it. Because some vehicles will still be required to stop at the plaza, the rumble strips leading to it will remain in place to slow traffic for safety reasons.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotia-registered vehicles now have free passage through the Cobequid Pass, but I encourage Nova Scotians to apply for a free transponder to enable easier and quicker passage through the toll plaza.”
     - Kim Masland, Minister of Public Works

Quick Facts:
-- in 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an average of 7,600 cars and 2,100 trucks used the Cobequid Pass daily
-- about 50 per cent of the passenger vehicles which use the Cobequid Pass are registered out-of-province; about 70 per cent of commercial trucks are registered out-of-province
-- out-of-province tourists will continue to pay to use the highway
-- the last toll increase for passenger and commercial vehicles was January 1, 2004
-- the Cobequid Pass was opened in 1997 to replace the old Highway 104 which ran through the Wentworth Valley; it cost approximately $112.9 million to construct and took 20 months to complete

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
La plupart des élèves des écoles publiques seront en congé dès la fin des classes le vendredi 17 décembre.

Tous les membres du personnel se présenteront au travail la semaine prochaine sauf s'ils sont tenus de s'isoler pour des raisons de santé publique. Le début officiel du congé scolaire des fêtes demeure le mercredi 22 décembre.
Les centres d'apprentissage demeureront ouverts les 20 et 21 décembre pour les élèves qui dépendent des centres d'apprentissage et qui ont besoin de soutien supplémentaire.

« Je remercie tous nos élèves et notre personnel pour leur travail cette année, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Nous devons reconnaître que l'éclosion récente de cas dans notre province crée des pressions sur nos écoles, sur les employés et sur les élèves et les familles qui sont liés à nos classes. En raison de l'impact du variant Omicron du point de vue opérationnel et de la nécessité pour les contacts étroits de s'isoler, nous avons pris la décision de modifier le calendrier scolaire et d'appuyer ceux qui en ont le plus besoin. La décision prise aujourd'hui offre une certitude aux parents, aux tuteurs, aux élèves et au personnel. »

Quelques écoles sont passées à l'apprentissage à la maison, et il est prévu que quelques autres le feront également avant vendredi en raison de l'impact de la pandémie du point de vue opérationnel.

La ministre Druhan et le Ministère continueront de surveiller la situation pendant la période des fêtes et consulteront les responsables de la Santé publique avant la rentrée en classe. La décision d'entamer le congé des fêtes plus tôt est une décision opérationnelle prise en raison des pressions exercées sur notre personnel. Il ne s'agit pas d'une décision de la Santé publique.

Ces changements ont été faits en consultation avec les centres régionaux pour l'éducation et le Conseil scolaire acadien provincial, le Syndicat des enseignants de la Nouvelle-Écosse et l'Association des administratrices et administrateurs des écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Most public school students will start their holiday break after classes end Friday, December 17.

All staff will report to work as usual next week unless they are required to isolate for public health reasons. The start of the official school holiday break remains Wednesday, December 22.

Learning centres will remain open on December 20 and 21 for students whose needs are met through learning centres and require additional support.

“I want to thank all of our students and staff for their hard work this year,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “We need to recognize that the recent outbreak in our province has put pressure on our schools, the people who work there and the students and families who are connected to our classrooms. In light of the operational impacts stemming from the Omicron variant and the need for close contacts to self-isolate, we have made the decision to modify our school calendar and support those who need it most. Today’s decision will provide clarity and certainty to parents, guardians, students and staff.”

A small number of schools have had to move to at-home learning, and it is expected that a small number of others may need to do so before Friday due to operational impacts from the pandemic.

Minister Druhan said the Department will continue to monitor the pandemic over the holidays and consult public health before schools reopen. The decision to begin the school holiday break early is an operational decision based on staffing pressures and not a public health decision.

These changes were made in consultation with regional centres for education and Conseil scolaire acadien provincial, the Nova Scotia Teachers Union and the Public School Administrators Association of Nova Scotia.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","178 nouveaux cas de COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--178 nouveaux cas de COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 15 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 178 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 113 cas dans le secteur du centre, 55 dans le secteur de l'est, 5 dans le secteur du nord et 5 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d’un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd’hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d’une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans le suivi effectué par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d’isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu’un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l’exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (analysé en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l’on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts. 

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe ensuite un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu’elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Aucun nouveau cas n’a été signalé aujourd’hui à l’établissement Parkland d’Antigonish, un établissement résidentiel pour personnes âgées. Deux résidents et deux membres du personnel de cette résidence ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage, et un employé de Mary’s Court, la communauté de soins de longue durée, a aussi reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage. Personne n'est hospitalisé.

Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés, et tous les résidents de Mary’s Court ont reçu une dose de rappel. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour freiner la propagation du virus. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 14 décembre, on a avisé 14 écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Le 14 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 6 940 tests.

Six personnes sont hospitalisées, dont deux aux soins intensifs. Personne n’est hospitalisé dans le secteur de l’est.

Au 14 décembre, 1 698 007 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 791 379 sont une deuxième dose, et 58 047 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Peu importe votre statut vaccinal, si vous présentez des symptômes, vous devez vous isoler immédiatement et consulter le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour faire une auto-évaluation et prendre rendez-vous pour passer un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Conseils au sujet des tests pour les personnes asymptomatiques

Pour savoir si vous devez passer un test de dépistage même si vous êtes asymptomatique, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). Les personnes qui ne répondent pas à ces critères peuvent passer un test rapide dans une clinique temporaire ou une unité mobile. Les emplacements sont indiqués au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing (en anglais seulement).

Les personnes à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elles étaient des contacts étroits d’un cas positif ou qu’elles étaient dans un des endroits figurant à la liste des endroits où il y a eu exposition au virus de la COVID-19 doivent s’isoler immédiatement et surveiller leurs symptômes, même si elles sont entièrement vaccinées. Elles doivent aussi prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR 72 heures après l’exposition.

Si le resultat du test est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle est entièrement vaccinée. Si le résultat du test est positif, elle doit poursuivre son isolement et suivre les directives de la Santé publique qui se trouvent en ligne.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","178 New Cases of COVID-19","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--178 New Cases of COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 15, Nova Scotia is reporting 178 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 113 cases in Central Zone, 55 cases in Eastern Zone, five cases in Northern Zone and five cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

There are no new cases reported today at Parkland Antigonish, a seniors’ living community. Two residents and two staff members from the retirement home have tested positive and one staff member from Mary’s Court, the licensed long-term care neighbourhood, has tested positive. No one is in hospital.

All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all residents of Mary’s Court have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On December 14, 14 schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

On December 14, Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 6,940 tests.

Six people are in hospital, including two in ICU. There are no hospitalizations in Eastern Zone.

As of December 14, 1,698,007 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 791,379 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 58,047 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing advice:

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Regardless of vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment. They should also book a COVID-19 test if, in the past 48 hours, they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms but should get tested are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet any of the criteria for asymptomatic testing can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Rapid test locations are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact of a positive case or if they were at a site listed in a COVID-19 exposure notification should isolate immediately and monitor for symptoms, even if fully vaccinated. They should also book a PCR test for 72 hours after the exposure.

If the test result is negative, people can stop isolating if fully vaccinated. If it is positive, they should continue isolating and follow the public health direction that’s online.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Patients at the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre will soon have access to a new state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

The government is investing $5 million to cover the purchase, installation and operation of a new MRI unit, which is essential to meet the clinical requirements and acceptable wait time standards for cardiac and neurology health services.

“Nova Scotians deserve timely access to high-quality healthcare. This includes having access to the equipment needed for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “The new MRI at the Halifax Infirmary will provide patients and medical staff with up-to-date equipment and address wait times for required care.”

MRI machines use powerful magnets and computers to take detailed pictures of internal organs and systems inside the body. These pictures are necessary for clinicians to make important decisions about treatment.

The new scanner will replace the existing one at the Halifax Infirmary, which is the busiest in the province and has exceeded its lifespan. It will be the primary unit for both cardiac and neurosurgery for the province and neurology at the QEII.

The unit will operate seven days a week and average 100 hours of use per week. It is expected to be operational by fall 2022.

Quotes:
“This is fantastic news for the patients of Nova Scotia and the Maritimes. Our existing MRI at the Halifax Infirmary is the busiest in the province and getting a new system will reduce our downtime and increase the number of scans that we can perform. This will mean more access to better care for our patients.”
     - Dr. James Clarke, Chief of Diagnostic Imaging, Central Zone, Nova Scotia Health, 

Quick Facts:
-- MRIs in Nova Scotia are typically used for more than 6,400 scans per year 
-- the QEII Health Sciences Centre includes the Victoria General and Halifax Infirmary sites
-- the QEII Health Sciences Centre has on average each day 3,454 outpatient/clinic visits, 206 emergency visits and 75 surgeries
-- 102,215 patients visited the Halifax Infirmary site for outpatient care in 2019-2020
-- improved infrastructure helps with recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals

NOTE: The following is a statement from L’nu Affairs and Community Services Minister Karla MacFarlane.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our first concern as a Department is always the safety and well-being of the clients we serve, and that will not change. Our work in supporting those experiencing homelessness is a priority.

Recently, there has been information being reported about the closure of the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre emergency shelter that I would like to address.

I need to make this abundantly clear: our government has not pulled, stopped or denied funding to the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre emergency shelter.

The centre has funding and will continue to receive funding from the Province for as long as they choose to remain a shelter operator.

The Province approved $850,000 in funding to the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre for emergency shelter placements until May 31, 2022, at which time the new Diamond Bailey House will open and Indigenous clients will transition. Recently, we announced $1.6 million for the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre to operate the Diamond Bailey House. An additional $76,000 will be provided in the first year for start-up costs.

The Province is working in partnership with the Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Centre on its restructuring to ensure that culturally appropriate services are available to urban Indigenous Nova Scotians. We are always focused on the safety and well-being of homeless individuals staying in shelters and culturally safe places play a critical role in reducing harm.

We will continue to move quickly with a variety of interventions and supports to ensure those who need help receive it. We value our community partners and recognize the invaluable role they play in supporting vulnerable Nova Scotians.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","127 nouveaux cas de COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--127 nouveaux cas de COVID-19
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 14 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 127 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.

Il y a 68 cas dans le secteur de l'est, 42 dans le secteur du centre, 11 dans le secteur du nord et 6 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Compte tenu d’un retard dans la saisie de données dans Panorama (le système de gestion des cas de la Santé publique), le nombre de cas annoncé aujourd’hui provient des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non pas des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle.

En raison d’une montée en flèche du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans les suivis effectués par la Santé publique. La Santé publique tentera de joindre dans les 24 heures toutes les personnes qui ont un résultat positif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire, et ce, pour fournir des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d’isolement et de tests. On demandera à toutes les personnes visées de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Ce pourrait être le seul contact qu’un cas confirmé pourrait avoir avec la Santé publique. Les suivis détaillés sont priorisés pour appuyer la recherche de contacts dans les écoles, les établissements de soins de longue durée et de santé, les établissements correctionnels, les refuges et autres lieux de rassemblement.

Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler pendant 72 heures après l’exposition et obtenir ensuite un test de dépistage PCR (en laboratoire). Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent mettre fin à leur isolement après avoir reçu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage analysé en laboratoire. Celles qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent poursuivre leur isolement conformément aux directives pour les contacts étroits qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés, directives (en anglais) que l’on trouve ici : https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts. 

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole immédiatement et passe un test de dépistage PCR, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le résultat du test PCR est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement si elle ne présente pas de symptômes et qu’elle est entièrement vaccinée.

Aucun nouveau cas n’a été signalé aujourd’hui à l’établissement Parkland d’Antigonish, un établissement résidentiel pour personnes âgées. Deux résidents et deux membres du personnel de cette résidence ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage, et un employé de Mary’s Court, la communauté de soins de longue durée, a aussi reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage.

Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés, et tous les résidents de Mary’s Court ont reçu une dose de rappel. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 13 décembre, on a avisé cinq écoles qu’il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Le 13 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 303 tests.

Six personnes sont hospitalisées, dont deux aux soins intensifs. Personne n’est hospitalisé dans le secteur de l’est.

Au 13 décembre, 1 688 836 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 791 044 sont une deuxième dose, et 51 518 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Peu importe votre statut vaccinal, si vous présentez des symptômes, vous devez vous isoler immédiatement et consulter le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour faire une auto-évaluation et prendre rendez-vous pour passer un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Conseils au sujet des tests pour les personnes asymptomatiques

Pour savoir si vous devez passer un test de dépistage même si vous êtes asymptomatique, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). Les personnes qui ne répondent pas à ces critères peuvent passer un test rapide dans une clinique temporaire ou une unité mobile. Les emplacements sont indiqués au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing (en anglais seulement).|

Les personnes qui ont été avisées par la Santé publique qu'elles sont des contacts étroits pourraient devoir s'isoler.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","127 New Cases of COVID-19","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--127 New Cases of COVID-19
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 14, Nova Scotia is reporting 127 new cases of COVID-19.

There are 68 cases in Eastern Zone, 42 cases in Central Zone, 11 cases in Northern Zone and six cases in Western Zone.

Due to delays with data entry into Panorama (public health’s case management system), the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground.

Because of a spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow-up. Public health will try to contact anyone confirmed positive by the lab within 24 hours to provide information on required isolation and testing. All cases will be asked to contact their close contacts. This may be the only contact a positive case has with public health. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group settings.

All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate for 72 hours after the exposure and then get a lab-based (PCR) test. Those who are fully vaccinated can stop isolating after receiving a negative lab test. Those not fully vaccinated must continue to isolate, following the instructions for close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, found at https://www.nshealth.ca/information-covid-19-close-contacts

It is important that anyone who tests positive with a rapid test self-isolates immediately and gets a PCR test, regardless of vaccination status. If the PCR test is negative, they can stop isolating if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated.

There are no new cases reported today at Parkland Antigonish, a seniors’ living community. Two residents and two staff members from the retirement home have tested positive and one staff member from Mary’s Court, the licensed long-term care neighbourhood, has tested positive.

No one is in hospital. All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all residents of Mary’s Court have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On December 13, five schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

On December 13, Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 4,303 tests.

Six people are in hospital, including two in ICU. There are no hospitalizations in Eastern Zone.

As of December 13, 1,688,836 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 791,044 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 51,518 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing advice:

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Regardless of vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment. They should also book a COVID-19 test if, in the past 48 hours, they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms but should get tested are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet any of the criteria for asymptomatic testing can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Rapid test locations are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact of a positive case or if they were at a site listed in a COVID-19 exposure notification should isolate immediately and monitor for symptoms, even if fully vaccinated. They should also book a PCR test for 72 hours after the exposure.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 13 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 114 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.
 
Il y a 55 cas dans le secteur du centre, 52 cas dans le secteur de l'est, 5 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 2 dans le secteur du nord.

En raison de l'éclosion à l'Université St. Francis Xavier à Antigonish, le nombre de cas publié découle des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle. 

Les personnes infectées dans le cadre de cette éclosion éprouvent des symptômes très légers et il s'agit surtout de jeunes personnes entièrement vaccinées.
 
En raison de l'augmentation accrue du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans les suivis effectués par la Santé publique. Les personnes dont le résultat du test de dépistage est positif continueront de recevoir une communication initiale de la Santé publique dans un délai de 24 heures. Elles recevront des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d'isolement et de dépistage et on leur demandera de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Les suivis plus détaillés seront priorisés et pourraient être retardés. La Santé publique continuera d'appuyer la recherche de contact dans les écoles, dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, dans les établissements correctionnels, dans les refuges et d'autres situations.
 
Tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'ils reçoivent un résultat négatif au test de dépistage PCR (en laboratoire). Ce test doit avoir lieu au moins 72 heures après l'exposition. La Santé publique recommande fortement à toute la population de la Nouvelle-Écosse de subir régulièrement des tests rapides.
 
Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole et passe un test de dépistage en laboratoire, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le test de confirmation est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement à condition de ne présenter aucun symptôme. La capacité de dépistage a augmenté dans la région d'Antigonish. Les heures du centre de dépistage ont été prolongées et des unités mobiles ont été déployées. 

Le Laboratoire national de microbiologie a confirmé 40 cas du variant Omicron. Ces cas ont déjà été signalés.

La Province signale une éclosion à l’établissement Parkland d’Antigonish, un établissement résidentiel pour personnes âgées. Deux résidents et deux membres du personnel de cette résidence ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage, et un employé de Mary’s Court, la communauté de soins de longue durée, a aussi reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage.

Personne n'est hospitalisé. Tous les employés et tous les résidents sont entièrement vaccinés, et tous les résidents de Mary’s Court ont reçu une dose de rappel.  La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées. 

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé 17 écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 882 tests le 10 décembre, 4 766 tests le 11 décembre et 5 304 tests le 12 décembre.

Six personnes sont hospitalisées, dont deux au soins intensifs. Personne n’est hospitalisé dans le secteur de l’est.  

Au 12 décembre, 1 681 621 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 790 778 sont une deuxième dose, et 46 537 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

--------------------------------------------------------
En raison des récentes éclosions de cas de COVID-19 et du nouveau variant Omicron, les exigences en matière d'éloignement physique et les restrictions sur les rassemblements entreront de nouveau en vigueur afin de protéger les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et le système de soins de santé au cours des prochaines semaines. Les exigences liées au port du masque sont également resserrées et des mesures plus rigoureuses seront en vigueur dans les écoles.

« Nous ne connaissons pas ce variant assez bien pour ne pas agir maintenant, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Je ne prends aucun risque avec la vie des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ou la capacité de notre système de santé de prendre soin de notre population. Nous devons agir rapidement pour reprendre le contrôle. Nous allons lutter contre ce virus de la même façon que nous l'avons fait depuis le début. C'est pourquoi nous devons remettre en place certaines restrictions. »

À compter du mardi 14 décembre, des mesures sanitaires plus rigoureuses sont en place dans les écoles, et ce, jusqu'au congé des fêtes la semaine prochaine :
-- Sports scolaires limités à l'acquisition de compétences seulement
-- Aucune assemblée et aucun concert des fêtes
-- Aucune activité qui combine plus d'une classe, y compris les activités telles que « les camarades de lecture »
-- Visiteurs essentiels seulement dans les écoles
-- Masques exigés à l'intérieur lorsque l'éloignement physique n'est pas possible
-- Accès limité aux cafétérias

Les personnes entièrement vaccinées peuvent utiliser les gymnases et les théâtres dans les écoles après les heures scolaires lorsque cela est faisable d'un point de vue opérationnel.

« Nous avons agi rapidement et avec prudence pendant toute la pandémie, et cela nous a bien servi, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Nous concentrons nos efforts dans trois domaines clés pour tenter de reprendre le contrôle sur ce nouveau variant, soit le port du masque, les rassemblements et l'éloignement physique. Ces restrictions sont temporaires afin de nous permettre d'en apprendre davantage sur ce variant et de permettre à un plus grand nombre de personnes de se faire vacciner. »

À compter de 9 h le vendredi 17 décembre, et ce, jusqu'à la nouvelle année au plus tard, les restrictions suivantes seront en place :

Exigences en matière d'éloignement physique et du port du masque
-- Une distance physique de deux mètres (six pieds) est exigée à l'intérieur comme à l'extérieur, sauf entre les personnes d'un même ménage ou d'un groupe social formé des mêmes 20 personnes au maximum.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Restrictions Return Provincewide","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Restrictions Return Provincewide
--------------------------------------------------------
In light of recent COVID-19 outbreaks and the threat of the new Omicron variant, physical distance and gathering limits are returning to help protect Nova Scotians and the health system over the next few weeks. Mask requirements are also being tightened and there are enhanced measures at schools.

“We don’t know enough about this variant to let things go,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I’m not taking chances with the lives of Nova Scotians or the ability of our health system to care for people. We need to act quickly to get things under control. The way we fight this is no different than what we’ve done all along. That’s why we need to bring back some of the previous restrictions.”

Effective Tuesday, December 14, enhanced public health measures at schools until the holiday break next week include:
-- school sports are limited to team skills training only
-- no assemblies and no holiday concerts
-- no mixing of classes, including a pause on activities like Reading Buddies
-- essential visitors only in schools
-- masks are required indoors where physical distancing cannot be maintained
-- limited access to cafeterias

Fully vaccinated community members can use school gyms and theatres after hours if operationally feasible.

“We have acted quickly and cautiously throughout this pandemic and that has served us well,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “We’re focusing on tightening up in three key areas to try to get this latest variant under control – masking, gathering limits and physical distancing. These restrictions are an interim step while we learn more about this variant and get more people vaccinated.”

Starting at 9 a.m. on Friday, December 17, and lasting until at least the new year, the following restrictions will be in place:

Physical distance and mask requirements
-- physical distance of two metres (six feet) is required indoors and outdoors, except among people in the same household or a consistent social group of up to 20 people
--places like fitness and recreation facilities, retail businesses, malls, museums, libraries and personal services like hair salons can operate at the maximum capacity possible with physical distancing
-- food establishments and liquor-licensed establishments must have physical distance between tables and a limit of 20 people per table
-- people must be seated to remove their mask for eating or drinking; all other mask requirements for indoor public places remain, including wearing them when seated for other activities 
-- masks are required in areas of workplaces where physical distance cannot be achieved, as well as common areas, areas where people are serving the public and areas with poor ventilation 
-- individuals, businesses and organizations all have responsibility for ensuring mask requirements are followed and can all be subject to enforcement action

Gathering limits
-- indoor and outdoor informal gatherings, typically at home, are limited to 20 people from the same household or consistent social group; physical distance and proof of full vaccination are not required; masks are not required except in indoor public places
-- gathering limits of 50 per cent of capacity to a maximum of 150 people indoors and 250 outdoors apply to social gatherings, regular faith services, weddings, funerals and their associated receptions and visitation, special events, meetings, training, festivals, and audiences for sports events and arts and culture events (like performances and movie theatres) that are hosted by a recognized business or organization, including faith organizations 
-- a limit of 60 participants indoors and outdoors applies to sports practices, games, and regular league play; tournaments are not allowed; physical distance is not required, and masks are recommended when possible indoors and outdoors
-- a limit of 60 participants indoors and outdoors applies to professional and amateur arts and culture rehearsals and performances; competitions are not allowed; professionals must have a plan for their workplace; physical distance is not required, and masks are recommended when possible indoors and outdoors
-- children age 11 and younger continue to be restricted from entering Nova Scotia to participate in sports and arts and culture events and from participating in them outside Nova Scotia
-- specific organizational plans will be considered for large venues such as Scotiabank Centre, Halifax Exhibition Centre and Halifax Convention Centre
-- spectators at sports games or arts and culture performances cannot eat or drink in the main seating area of the recreation facility or event venue; people must go to a designated area for eating and drinking.

Long-term care
-- a limit of two visitors at a time with long-term care residents; it does not have to be the same two visitors each time
-- it is strongly recommended that visitors have a rapid test within 24 hours of the visit
-- visitors can have quick close contact like a hug but then need to stay physically distanced for the rest of the visit
-- the requirement for visitors to wear masks and be fully vaccinated, except for end-of-life visits, remains
-- except for medical appointments, residents in long-term care can only leave the facility if they are fully vaccinated, and it is strongly recommended that they have their booster dose as well.

Residents in Disability Support Program homes licensed under the Homes for Special Care Act have the same restrictions as residents in long-term care.

There is no change in the requirement for proof of full vaccination for discretionary activities. It is still required for attendees and volunteers, even in places where gathering limits and physical distance will apply.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","114 New Cases of COVID-19, Omicron Variant Cases, Long-Term Care Outbreak","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--114 New Cases of COVID-19, Omicron Variant Cases, Long-Term Care Outbreak 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 13, Nova Scotia is reporting 114 new cases of COVID-19.
 
There are 55 cases in Central Zone, 52 cases in Eastern Zone, five cases in Western Zone, and two cases in Northern Zone.

Because of the outbreak at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflect the situation on the ground. 

Those infected in the outbreak are experiencing relatively mild symptoms and the cases are mostly young people who are fully vaccinated.
 
Due to the spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow up. People whose lab test is positive will continue to receive an initial contact from public health within 24 hours and they will be provided information on required isolation and testing and asked to contact their close contacts. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized and may be delayed. Public health will continue to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, correctional facilities, shelters and other settings.
 
All close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate until they have a negative result from a lab-based (PCR) test. The lab test should be performed at least 72 hours after the exposure. Public health strongly recommends regular rapid testing for all Nova Scotians.
 
It is important that people who test positive with a rapid test self-isolate and get a lab test regardless of vaccination status. If that confirmatory test is negative, they may stop isolating if they have no symptoms. Testing has been increased in the Antigonish area, including extended hours at the testing centre, and mobile units have been deployed. 

The National Microbiology Lab has confirmed 40 Omicron variant cases. These cases were previously reported.

The Province is reporting an outbreak at Parkland Antigonish, a seniors living community. Two residents and two staff members from the retirement home have tested positive and one staff member from Mary’s Court, the licensed long-term care neighbourhood, has tested positive.

No one is in hospital. All staff and residents are fully vaccinated, and all residents of Mary’s Court have had a booster shot. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

Over the past three days, 17 schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs completed 3,882 tests on December 10; 4,766 tests on December 11; and 5,304 tests on December 12.

Six people are in hospital, including two in ICU. There are no hospitalizations in Eastern Zone.  

As of December 12, 1,681,621 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 790,778 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 46,537 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing advice:
Symptoms and self-assessment:
 
Regardless of your vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment and book a COVID-19 test if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:
 
-- cough (new or worsening)
 
Or two or more of the following symptoms:
 
-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
 
People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.
 
Testing advice for people without symptoms:
 
People who do not have symptoms and should get tested are listed at https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site. People who do not meet this criteria can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Locations are listed at https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .
 
People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact may need to self-isolate. Information about self-isolation requirements for different situations is at https://www.nshealth.ca/what-do-i-need-know-about-covid-19-self-isolation .

"Agriculture / Education and Early Childhood Development","Province Invests in Student Health and Well-being, Covers School Milk Price Increase","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT/AGRICULTURE--Province Invests in Student Health and Well-being, Covers School Milk Price Increase 
--------------------------------------------------
Schools play a pivotal role in supporting the health of students. To support student success and well-being, the government is investing $2 million in the new Healthy Schools Fund and covering the increased cost of milk for the remainder of the 2021-22 school year.

The Healthy Schools Fund will provide each school across the province with $5,000 and an additional $1 per student annually for programs and activities that support mental and physical health or cultural awareness.

“We are providing schools with additional resources so they can deliver programs centered around student well-being,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Schools can choose how to spend the money based on local needs and can use funds for activities including outdoor play, cultural awareness and programs that support mental health.”

Schools will work with students, teachers and school advisory councils to determine how to best spend money from the Healthy Schools Fund.

Nova Scotia’s School Milk Program prices will not increase for the current school year. The price was scheduled to increase in January due to rising production costs for dairy producers and processors. The government will absorb this increase to lessen the impact on students and families who are struggling financially.

“We want to support families who are feeling the impacts of inflation, as well as dairy producers and processors who are experiencing rising production costs,” said Agriculture Minister Greg Morrow. “By covering the increased costs for the rest of this year, we’re providing students with nutritious local milk each day through the Nova Scotia School Milk Program.”

The School Milk Program is cost shared between the Department of Agriculture and dairy producers and processors. It has provided milk daily to students in grades primary to 12 at a reduced price since 1974.

Quotes:
“We know student success is directly linked to overall student well-being. This funding will provide schools an opportunity to directly improve our students’ mental, physical, social, and emotional health. We look forward to working with our school community to put these funds to use, whether that be increasing fitness activities, supporting our student-led groups and clubs, or expanding upon our cultural experiences.”
     - Stephen Johnson, Principal, Hebbville Academy

Quick Facts:
-- programs and activities through the Healthy School Fund must be aligned with the province’s curriculum
-- a key priority for the government, as identified in the ministers’ mandate letters, is to expand healthy living opportunities for students by increasing personal fitness and mental health opportunities
-- in 2019-2020, about 330 schools participated in the School Milk Program; some schools opted not to take part this year due to COVID-19 concerns
-- the next increase in the price for school milk products will take effect in September 2022 and will be the first increase in more than eight years
-- milk prices are set by the Natural Products Marketing Council, an adjudicative board established in legislation by the Department of Agriculture; the Council had approved an increase to the price of school milk for January 1, 2022; however, the Province agreed to cover the increase for the current school year

-----------------------------------------------------
Les écoles jouent un rôle primordial dans la santé des élèves. Ainsi, afin de favoriser leur réussite et leur mieux-être, le gouvernement va investir deux millions de dollars dans le nouveau Fonds pour les écoles-santé et prendre en charge l’augmentation du prix du lait pendant le reste de l’année scolaire 2021-2022.

Chaque école de la province recevra 5,000 $ au titre de ce fonds, ainsi que 1 $ par élève et par année pour les programmes et activités liés à la santé mentale et physique et à la sensibilisation culturelle.

« Nous donnons aux écoles des ressources supplémentaires afin qu’elles puissent offrir des programmes axés sur le mieux-être des élèves, a indiqué Becky Druhan, ministre de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Les écoles peuvent décider de la façon dont elles dépensent cet argent en fonction de leurs besoins. Elles peuvent par exemple s’en servir pour offrir des jeux en plein air, des activités de sensibilisation culturelle et des programmes liés à la santé mentale. »

Les écoles, les élèves, les enseignants et les conseils consultatifs scolaires détermineront ensemble la meilleure façon de dépenser l’argent accordé au titre du Fonds pour les écoles-santé.

Les prix liés au Programme lait-école de la Nouvelle-Écosse n’augmenteront pas pendant le reste de l’année scolaire. Ces prix devaient augmenter en janvier en raison de la hausse des coûts des producteurs laitiers et des transformateurs, mais le gouvernement prendra en charge l’augmentation afin de faciliter les choses pour les élèves ainsi que les familles éprouvant des difficultés financières.

« Nous voulons aider les familles qui subissent les conséquences de l’inflation, ainsi que les producteurs laitiers et les transformateurs dont les coûts de production augmentent, a expliqué Greg Morrow, ministre de l’Agriculture. En prenant en charge l’augmentation des coûts pendant le reste de l’année, nous pouvons chaque jour offrir aux élèves du lait produit localement grâce au Programme lait-école de la Nouvelle-Écosse. »

Le ministère de l’Agriculture ainsi que les producteurs laitiers et les transformateurs financent conjointement ce programme, qui permet d’offrir chaque jour aux élèves de la maternelle à la 12e année, depuis 1974, du lait à prix réduit.


Citations :
« Nous savons que la réussite des élèves est directement liée à leur bien-être général. Cet argent permettra donc aux écoles d’améliorer directement la santé mentale, physique, sociale et psychologique des élèves. Nous serons heureux de collaborer avec la communauté scolaire pour utiliser ces fonds, que ce soit pour multiplier les activités physiques, soutenir les groupes et clubs dirigés par des élèves ou développer les expériences culturelles. »
     - Stephen Johnson, directeur, Hebbville Academy

Faits en bref :
-- Les programmes et activités financés au titre du Fonds pour les écoles-santé doivent correspondre au programme d’études provincial.
-- L’une des grandes priorités du gouvernement, comme l’énoncent les lettres de mandat des ministres, est de multiplier, pour les élèves, les occasions d’avoir une vie saine en offrant davantage de possibilités liées aux activités physiques et à la santé mentale.
-- En 2019-2020, quelque 330 écoles ont participé au Programme lait-école; certaines écoles ont décidé cette année de ne pas y participer en raison de la COVID-19.
-- La prochaine augmentation du prix des produits laitiers consommés dans les écoles aura lieu en septembre 2022; il s’agira de la première augmentation en plus de huit ans.
-- Les prix du lait sont fixés par le Natural Products Marketing Council, qui a été établi par voie législative par le ministère de l’Agriculture. Ce conseil avait autorisé une augmentation du prix du lait consommé dans les écoles pour le 1er janvier 2022, mais la Province a accepté de prendre en charge cette augmentation pour le reste de l’année scolaire.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Tests rapides offerts dans les bibliothèques pendant la période des fêtes","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Tests rapides offerts dans les bibliothèques pendant la période des fêtes
-----------------------------------------------------
À compter d'aujourd'hui 13 décembre, les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse peuvent passer prendre des trousses de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 dans les bibliothèques publiques à l'échelle de la province.

« Nous avons cessé de recommander les tests pour les personnes asymptomatiques il y a quelque temps, mais nous reconnaissons qu'il s'agit d'une autre façon de protéger tout le monde pendant les rassemblements des fêtes. C'est pourquoi nous offrons les tests de dépistage rapide à plus grande échelle pendant cette saison, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Un test rapide est une protection supplémentaire si vous organisez un rassemblement ou si vous y participez. Vous devriez également vous faire vacciner, éviter les déplacements, limiter votre cercle social, porter un masque lorsque c'est exigé ou si vous êtes en contact étroit avec des gens à l'extérieur de votre cercle social, et rester à la maison si vous êtes malade. »

En tout, 400 000 tests sont disponibles. Chaque trousse contient cinq tests, et chaque personne peut se procurer une trousse. Les tests peuvent être faits à la maison pour toute personne de trois ans ou plus. Si votre résultat est positif, vous devez vous isoler et prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR analysé en laboratoire afin de confirmer le résultat.

Les trousses de dépistage rapide sont toujours offertes dans les cliniques temporaires et les unités mobiles dans les collectivités où le nombre de cas est plus élevé. Les emplacements et des renseignements supplémentaires se trouvent au https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting (en anglais seulement).

Les voyageurs qui arrivent aux aéroports d'Halifax et de Sydney peuvent se procurer des tests rapides à l'aéroport. Les voyageurs internes qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés peuvent se procurer un test PCR à faire à la maison pour le premier des deux tests exigés pour mettre fin à leur isolement après sept jours.

Environ 2 000 entreprises et organismes à l'échelle de la province offrent des tests rapides à leurs employés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. Ils appuient les efforts de surveillance de la Santé publique. Ils ont reçu la permission d'offrir ces tests aux familles des employés pendant la saison des fêtes. 

Des trousses de dépistage rapide sont également distribuées aux enfants de 3 à 11 ans par l'entremise des écoles publiques et privées, des centres agréés et non agréés de garde d'enfants et des centres de ressources familiales. Les familles devraient utiliser ces tests dans les situations suivantes :
-- L'enfant présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 et il est difficile de se rendre à un centre de dépistage.
-- L'enfant présente seulement un symptôme léger, donc un test PCR analysé en laboratoire n'est pas nécessaire, et la famille est à l'aise de faire un prélèvement nasal peu profond sur l'enfant.

Toute autre personne qui présente des symptômes doit prendre rendez-vous pour un test PCR dans un centre de dépistage. Les gens qui ont voyagé, qui ont peut-être été exposés au virus ou qui ont reçu la directive de se faire tester pour une raison quelconque doivent également prendre rendez-vous pour un test. Les gens peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage au https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Rapid Tests Available at Libraries for Holiday Season","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Rapid Tests Available at Libraries for Holiday Season
--------------------------------------------------------
Starting today, December 13, Nova Scotians can pick up COVID-19 rapid test kits at public libraries across the province.

“While we stopped recommending general asymptomatic testing a while ago, we recognize it’s another way to keep gatherings safe over the holidays so we’re making rapid tests more widely available for the season,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “Doing a rapid test can add an extra layer of protection if you’re hosting or attending gatherings. Everyone should also get vaccinated, avoid travel, keep your social circle small, wear a mask where required or if you’re in close contact with people outside your circle, and stay home if you’re sick.”

There are 400,000 tests available. They are packaged in kits of five, and there is a limit of one kit per person. The tests can be used at home for people ages three and up. Anyone who has a positive result needs to self-isolate and book a lab-based PCR test at a testing site to confirm the result.

People can continue to get rapid test kits from pop-up sites and mobile units that are serving communities with higher case numbers. Locations and details are available at https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting

Incoming travellers can get rapid test kits at the Halifax and Sydney airports. Domestic travellers who are not fully vaccinated can get a take-home PCR test to use as the first of two tests required to stop isolating after seven days.

About 2,000 businesses and organizations around the province are providing rapid tests for employees through the employer screening program. They support public health’s surveillance efforts. They have permission to give tests to their employees’ families for the holiday season. 

Rapid test kits are being distributed for children ages three to 11 through public and private schools, licensed and unlicensed child-care centres, and family resource centres. Families should use these tests if:
-- the child has symptoms of COVID-19, and it is difficult to get to a testing site
-- a child only has one mild symptom, so a lab-based PCR test isn’t necessary, and the family is comfortable doing a shallow nose swab.

Other people who have symptoms should book a PCR test at a testing site. People should also book tests if they travelled, may have been exposed or were directed to get tested for certain reasons. Tests can be booked at https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en

---------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians with uninsurable damage from the heavy rain and windstorm on November 23 can apply for disaster financial assistance starting today, December 13.

“We know many Nova Scotians are dealing with storm-related damage, and this program will help ensure that they receive the support they need,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Minister responsible for the Emergency Management Office. “This storm created a lot of fear and stress for many people. We want them to have peace of mind and be able to move forward.”

The disaster financial assistance program helps municipalities, small businesses, not-for-profit groups and Nova Scotians get back on their feet after a disaster. The program supports those whose losses aren’t covered by insurance. The program will cover uninsurable losses of up to $200,000 per household. There is no deductible.

Applications are available online and will also be available at Access Nova Scotia centres, MLA offices, municipal offices and by calling 211. The application period will be open for about three months. 

Nova Scotians affected by this storm should continue to assess damage, keep all receipts, take pictures and video and work with their insurance companies.

The Canadian Red Cross will administer emergency funding on behalf of the Province to a list of identified, eligible households. The Province has been working closely with the Red Cross since the storm and will continue to work with them to ensure that eligible households receive the financial assistance they need.

Quotes:
“We’ve gained extensive experience in recent years at rapidly distributing emergency financial aid on behalf of provincial governments after disasters like flooding and welcome the chance to help Nova Scotians the same way.”
     - Christina Baert-Wilson, Provincial Director, Nova Scotia, Canadian Red Cross

Quick Facts:
-- this disaster financial assistance program applies to structural damage to homes, as well as damage to uninsurable items like basic household goods and appliances, such as washers, dryers and furnaces
-- anyone who isn’t sure if their insurance covers their losses should contact their insurance broker or company or the Insurance Bureau of Canada at 1-844-227-5422

-----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : La Nouvelle-Écosse publie un communiqué abrégé au sujet de la COVID-19 aujourd'hui. Le tableau de bord en ligne ne sera pas mis à jour. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 12 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 111 nouveaux cas de COVID-19.
 
Il y a 63 cas dans le secteur du centre, 42 dans le secteur de l'est, 5 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

En raison de l'éclosion à l'Université St. Francis Xavier à Antigonish, le nombre de cas publié découle des résultats des tests en laboratoire et non des données dans le système Panorama. Ces données continuent de mieux refléter la situation réelle. 
 
La Santé publique souligne que certains cas liés à cette éclosion sont comptabilisés dans le secteur du centre en raison de l'adresse indiquée sur la carte santé de l'étudiant. C'est pourquoi tous les cas liés à l'université ne sont pas nécessairement inclus dans le nombre de cas du secteur de l'est.
 
Les personnes infectées dans le cadre de cette éclosion éprouvent des symptômes très légers et il s'agit surtout de jeunes personnes entièrement vaccinées.
 
En raison de l'augmentation accrue du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans les suivis effectués par la Santé publique. Les personnes dont le résultat du test de dépistage est positif continueront de recevoir une communication initiale de la Santé publique dans un délai de 24 heures. Elles recevront des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d'isolement et de dépistage et on leur demandera de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Les suivis plus détaillés seront priorisés et pourraient être retardés. La Santé publique continuera d'appuyer la recherche de contact dans les écoles, dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, dans les établissements correctionnels, dans les refuges et d'autres situations.
 
En raison de cette éclosion, tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'ils reçoivent un résultat négatif au test de dépistage PCR (en laboratoire). Ce test doit avoir lieu au moins 72 heures après l'exposition. La Santé publique recommande fortement à toute la population de la Nouvelle-Écosse de subir régulièrement des tests rapides.
 
Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole et passe un test de dépistage en laboratoire, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le test de confirmation est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement à condition de ne présenter aucun symptôme. Si la personne présente des symptômes et reçoit un résultat négatif au test PCR, elle doit répéter le test. La capacité de dépistage a augmenté dans la région d'Antigonish. Les heures du centre de dépistage ont été prolongées et des unités mobiles ont été déployées. Les endroits où les gens peuvent se faire tester dans la région d'Antigonish cette fin de semaine se trouvent au https://www.nshealth.ca/news/public-health-mobile-unit-providing-covid-19-testing-st-fx-university-weekend (en anglais seulement).
 
Le nombre de tests analysés par les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse le 11 décembre n'est pas encore disponible.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","111 New Cases of COVID-19","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--111 New Cases of COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Nova Scotia is issuing an abbreviated COVID-19 news release today. The online dashboard will not be updated. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 12, Nova Scotia is reporting 111 new cases of COVID-19.
 
There are 63 cases in Central Zone, 42 cases in Eastern Zone, 5 cases in Northern Zone, and 1 case in Western Zone.

Because of the outbreak at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, the number of positive cases being released today are lab results, not Panorama results. This continues to better reflects the situation on the ground. 
 
Public health notes that some cases associated with this outbreak are being counted in Central Zone because of the address on the student's health card. That is why not all of these cases are reflected in the Eastern Zone numbers.
 
Those infected in the outbreak are experiencing relatively mild symptoms and the cases are mostly young people who are fully vaccinated.
 
Because of the spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow up. People whose lab test is positive will continue to have receive an initial contact from public health within 24 hours and they will be provided information on required isolation and testing plus asked to contact their close contacts. Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized and may be delayed. Public health will continue to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, correctional facilities, shelters and other settings.
 
Due to this outbreak, all close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate until they have a negative result from a lab-based (PCR) test. The lab test should be performed at least 72 hours after the exposure. Public health strongly recommends regular rapid testing for all Nova Scotians.
 
It is important that people who test positive with a rapid test self-isolate and get a lab test regardless of vaccination status. If that confirmatory test is negative, they may stop isolating if they have no symptoms. If they have symptoms and the PCR test is negative, they should repeat the test. Testing has been increased in the Antigonish area, including extended hours at the testing centre and mobile units have been deployed. Testing locations in Antigonish this weekend can be found at https://www.nshealth.ca/news/public-health-mobile-unit-providing-covid-19-testing-st-fx-university-weekend .
 
The number of tests completed by the Nova Scotia Health Authority's labs is not yet available for December 11.
 
Testing advice:
 
Symptoms and self-assessment:
 
Regardless of your vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment and book a COVID-19 test if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:
 
-- cough (new or worsening)
 
Or two or more of the following symptoms:
 
-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
 
People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.
 
Testing advice for people without symptoms:
 
People who do not have symptoms and should get tested are listed at https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . People who do not meet this criteria can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Locations are listed at https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing .
 
People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact may need to self-isolate. Information about self-isolation requirements for different situations is at https://www.nshealth.ca/what-do-i-need-know-about-covid-19-self-isolation .

REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 10 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 123 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 16 rétablissements. 

Il y a 56 cas dans le secteur du centre, 60 dans le secteur de l'est, 6 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'ouest. 

En raison de l'éclosion à l'Université St. Francis Xavier à Antigonish, à compter d'aujourd'hui, le nombre de cas positifs signalés par les laboratoires, plutôt que les données dans le système Panorama, sera publié afin de mieux refléter la situation. Les résultats seront tout de même publiés par secteur.

La Santé publique souligne que certains cas liés à cette éclosion sont comptabilisés dans le secteur du centre en raison de l'adresse indiquée sur la carte santé de l'étudiant. C'est pourquoi tous les cas liés à l'université ne sont pas nécessairement inclus dans le nombre de cas du secteur de l'est.

Les personnes infectées dans le cadre de cette éclosion éprouvent des symptômes très légers et il s'agit surtout de jeunes personnes entièrement vaccinées. 

En raison de l'augmentation accrue du nombre de tests et de cas, il y a des retards dans les suivis effectués par la Santé publique. Les personnes dont le résultat du test de dépistage est positif continueront de recevoir une communication initiale de la Santé publique dans un délai de 24 heures. Elles recevront des renseignements sur les exigences en matière d'isolement et de dépistage et on leur demandera de communiquer avec leurs contacts étroits. Les suivis plus détaillés seront priorisés et pourraient être retardés. La Santé publique continuera d'appuyer la recherche de contact dans les écoles, dans les établissements de soins de longue durée, dans les établissements correctionnels, dans les refuges et d'autres situations.

En raison de cette éclosion, tous les contacts étroits, y compris ceux qui sont entièrement vaccinés, doivent maintenant s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'ils reçoivent un résultat négatif au test de dépistage PCR (en laboratoire). Ce test doit avoir lieu au moins 72 heures après l'exposition.  La Santé publique recommande fortement à toute la population de la Nouvelle-Écosse de subir régulièrement des tests rapides.

Il est important que toute personne qui reçoit un résultat positif au test rapide s'isole et passe un test de dépistage en laboratoire, peu importe son statut vaccinal. Si le test de confirmation est négatif, la personne peut mettre fin à son isolement à condition de ne présenter aucun symptôme. Si la personne présente des symptômes et reçoit un résultat négatif au test PCR, elle doit répéter le test. La capacité de dépistage a augmenté dans la région d'Antigonish.

Le 9 décembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Il y a eu 126 cas de COVID-19 dont l'épisode est survenu entre le 2 et le 9 décembre. De ce nombre : 

-- 61 personnes (48,4 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 6 personnes (4,8 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 59 personnes (46,8 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

Il y a eu 6 853 cas du 15 mars au 9 décembre. De ce nombre :

-- 776 personnes (11,3 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 420 personnes (6,1 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 5 657 personnes (82,5 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 341 personnes ont été hospitalisées. De ce nombre :

-- 23 personnes (6,7 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 33 personnes (9,7 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 285 personnes (83,6 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 44 personnes sont décédées. De ce nombre :

-- 11 personnes (25 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (6,8 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 30 personnes (68,2 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 44 341 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 3 au 9 décembre.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","123 New Cases of COVID-19, 16 Recoveries, State of Emergency Renewed","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--123 New Cases of COVID-19, 16 Recoveries, State of Emergency Renewed 
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Nova Scotia is not issuing COVID-19 news releases or updating the COVID-19 data dashboard on weekends. Monday updates will include weekend data.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 10, Nova Scotia is reporting 123 new cases of COVID-19 and 16 recoveries. 

There are 56 cases in Central Zone, 60 cases in Eastern Zone, 6 cases in Northern Zone, and one case in Western Zone. 

Because of the outbreak at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, beginning today, the number of positive cases using lab results, not Panorama results, will be reported to better reflect the situation on the ground. The results will continue to be reported by zone.

Public health notes that some cases associated with this outbreak are being counted in Central Zone because of the address on the student’s health card. That is why not all of these cases are reflected in the Eastern Zone numbers.

Those infected in the outbreak are experiencing relatively mild symptoms and the cases are mostly young people who are fully vaccinated. 

Because of the spike in testing and positive cases, public health is experiencing some delays in follow up. People whose lab test is positive will continue to receive an initial contact from public health within 24 hours and they will be provided information on required isolation and testing plus asked to contact their close contacts.  Detailed follow-ups are being prioritized and may be delayed. Public health will continue to support contact tracing in schools, long-term care, correctional facilities, shelters and other settings.

Due to this outbreak, all close contacts, including those who are fully vaccinated, now need to isolate until they have a negative result from a lab-based (PCR) test. The lab test should be performed at least 72 hours after the exposure.  Public health strongly recommends regular rapid testing for all Nova Scotians.

It is important that people who test positive with a rapid test self-isolate and get a lab test regardless of vaccination status. If that confirmatory test is negative, they may stop isolating if they have no symptoms. If they have symptoms and the PCR test is negative, they should repeat the test. Testing has been increased in the Antigonish area, including extended hours at the testing centre and mobile units have been deployed. Testing locations in Antigonish this weekend can be found at https://www.nshealth.ca/news/public-health-mobile-unit-providing-covid-19-testing-st-fx-university-weekend

On December 9, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures .

There have been 126 cases of COVID-19 with an episode date between December 2 and December 9. Of those:

-- 61 (48.4 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 6 (4.8 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 59 (46.8 per cent) were unvaccinated

There have been 6,853 cases from March 15 to December 9. Of those:

-- 776 (11.3 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 420 (6.1 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 5,657 (82.5 per cent) were unvaccinated

There were 341 people hospitalized. Of those:

-- 23 (6.7 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 33 (9.7 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 285 (83.6 per cent) were unvaccinated

Forty-four people died. Of those:

-- 11 (25.0 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 3 (6.8 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 30 (68.2 per cent) were unvaccinated

There were 44,341 rapid tests administered between December 3 and 9. This includes 2,091 rapid tests at the pop-up sites in Halifax, Dartmouth, and Tantallon and 42,250 through the workplace screening program. Another 17,314 home rapid tests were distributed at the pop-up sites.

On December 9, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 4,730 tests.

As of December 9, 1,671,588 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 790,288 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 40,860 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose. 

Since August 1, there have been 2,695 positive COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,442 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

The Province is renewing the state of emergency to protect the health and safety of Nova Scotians and ensure safety measures and other important actions can continue. The order will take effect at noon, Sunday, December 12, and extend to noon, Sunday, December 26, unless the government terminates or extends it.

Testing advice:

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Regardless of your vaccination status, anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment and book a COVID-19 test if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Testing advice for people without symptoms:

People who do not have symptoms and should get tested are listed at https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site. People who do not meet this criteria can get a rapid test at a pop-up site or a mobile unit. Locations are listed at https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus/covid-19-rapid-testing.

People who were advised by public health that they were a close contact may need to self-isolate. Information about self-isolation requirements for different situations is at https://www.nshealth.ca/what-do-i-need-know-about-covid-19-self-isolation.

"Environment and Climate Change","Nova Scotia Taking Action to Reduce Waste","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Nova Scotia Taking Action to Reduce Waste  
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes are coming to how solid waste is managed in Nova Scotia which will reduce waste in our landfills and create a greener and healthier environment.

The Department of Environment and Climate Change is working with municipalities and other stakeholders to expand the Province’s extended producer responsibility (EPR) program to include packaging, single-use plastics and paper. Nova Scotia already uses extended producer responsibility for many common household items such as electronics, computers and paint.

“Nova Scotians are proud of their record on waste reduction, but they want to do more,” said Environment and Climate Change Minister Tim Halman. “Extended producer responsibility is one of the most effective ways to keep waste out of landfills and move us from a throw-away economy to a circular economy. EPR drives innovation as producers design products with less environmental impact and creates economic opportunities and jobs in the recycling and packaging sector. EPR will bring many benefits to our communities, our environment and our economy.”

The changes will require the producers of these items to develop new ways to extend and manage the lifecycle of these items.

The Department will begin targeted stakeholder consultation on January 10 with:
-- municipalities
-- Divert Nova Scotia
-- the retail sector, specifically, large grocery and retail store chains, the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses and the Retail Council of Canada
-- waste management facility operators and haulers
-- apartment building property groups and associations
-- academia
-- industry and business associations
-- environmental stewardship organizations 
-- and other relevant stakeholders.

Their input will help design the new waste management model, regulations, timelines and exemptions for single-use plastics, packaging and paper.

Quotes:
“Expanding extended producer responsibility to include packaging, single-use plastics and paper will help keep valuable materials out of Nova Scotia’s landfills, help with our transition to a lower carbon circular economy and empower producers to design products with less environmental impacts. EPR is good for our environment, our economy and will help our recycling industry grow and prosper. We look forward to participating in the consultation and working with the provincial government and other partners to make expanded EPR a reality.”
     - Scott Skinner, CEO, Clean Foundation of Nova Scotia

“EPR for printed paper and packaging is a long-running priority of Nova Scotian municipalities. The legislation and the regulations to follow will be positive steps towards ensuring environmentally mindful practices of producers and fiscal sustainability of our municipal solid waste network. Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities looks forward to continuing our work supporting this important legislation and participating in the upcoming targeted stakeholder consultation.” 
     - Amanda McDougall, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities

“This highly anticipated announcement is a positive step forward in promoting the circular economy and improving the management of difficult to recycle packaging in Nova Scotia. Municipalities are ready to work together with the Province and the business sector to improve efficiencies in our waste management system.”
     - Tony Mancini, Chair, HRM Environment and Sustainability Standing Committee and District 6 Councillor
 
Quick Facts:
-- the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities passed a resolution in 2018 supporting extended producer responsibility for packaging, plastics and paper  
-- Nova Scotia began an extended producer responsibility program for used oil, glycol, paint, computers and electronics, such as microwaves and televisions, in 2019 
-- the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act has 28 goals to address climate change, reduce waste, and guide the province to cleaner and more prosperous future; one of the goals is to support the growth of a circular economy by expanding expanded producer responsibility 
-- the circular economy retains and recovers as much value as possible from resources by reusing, repairing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, repurposing or recycling products and materials  
-- Nova Scotians currently produce 400 kilograms of waste per person, per year; the Province’s goal is to reduce solid waste disposal rates to no more than 300 kilograms per person, per year by 2030

"Health and Wellness","VirtualCareNS Pilot Program Expansion","HEALTH/WELLNESS--VirtualCareNS Pilot Program Expansion
---------------------------------------------------------------
People in central and eastern Nova Scotia who are on the Need a Family Practice Registry will start receiving invitations for VirtualCareNS next week.

VirtualCareNS gives people on the registry the option to access a primary-care provider online. It is a free program for patients delivered through Maple – one of Canada’s leading virtual-care platforms – with Nova Scotia primary-care providers.

“Nova Scotians have made it clear that access to healthcare is a priority,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We know we need to do things differently, and virtual care is an efficient way of making sure every Nova Scotian on the registry has access to primary care while we focus on recruitment efforts and other improvements.”

The government is investing $1.3 million in the expansion of VirtualCareNS, which is already available in the Northern and Western health zones.

Beginning Monday, December 13, Nova Scotia Health will be contacting people who live in Central and Eastern zones by email, starting in communities with the largest number of people on the registry. People who have been on the registry the longest will be contacted first. Anyone who wants to update their email address on file can call 811 to do so.

To be eligible for VirtualCareNS, people must:
-- be on the Need a Family Practice Registry
-- hold a valid Nova Scotia health card number
-- be able to access the internet through a computer or mobile device
-- have an email address that they regularly use
-- be in the province when accessing VirtualCareNS.

During a virtual appointment, primary-care providers can prescribe medications, order tests and make referrals for specialized care. If a patient’s health concerns can’t be resolved virtually, they will be provided with options for in-person care.

The VirtualCareNS pilot program launched in Northern and Western zones last spring. People on the Need a Family Practice Registry in those zones with an email address on file have been invited to join VirtualCareNS. Those without an email address on file soon will receive a letter by mail with more information on how to participate.

Quotes:
“Beginning the expansion of VirtualCareNS into the Central and Eastern zones ensures that every Nova Scotian on the Need a Family Practice Registry will have timely access to a family doctor or nurse practitioner to receive the care that they need. We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both patients and providers about this initiative and are continuously looking at ways to enhance virtual care options for Nova Scotians.”
     - Gail Tomblin Murphy, Vice-President, Research, Innovation and Discovery, and Chief Nurse Executive, Nova Scotia Health

“Virtual care enables us to provide timely care and bridge the access gap for people who are unattached. We continue to recruit more family physicians and nurse practitioners to provide care through VirtualCareNS so we can ensure that everyone on the Need a Family Practice Registry can access care virtually until they are connected to a family practice.”
     - Dr. Maria Alexiadis, Senior Medical Director, Primary Health Care and Chronic Disease Management Network, Nova Scotia Health, and family physician, VirtualCareNS

“Since the launch of the pilot program earlier this year, we’ve seen tremendous success in bringing accessible care to Nova Scotians in the Northern and Western zones. We’re proud to continue working with Nova Scotia Health to expand the program into the Central and Eastern zones and to continue to deliver an exceptional virtual care experience for patients and providers across the province.”
     - Shelly-Ann Rampersad, Vice-President of Clinical Operations, Maple

Quick Facts:
-- since launching in Northern and Western zones in May, 10,293 people have registered for a VirtualCareNS account and 3,778 virtual visits have taken place
-- there are now 29 primary-care providers (25 family physicians and four nurse practitioners) delivering care through VirtualCareNS, with more providers to be added
-- expanding VirtualCareNS addresses the mandate of the Minister of Health and Wellness to provide Nova Scotians on the Need a Family Practice Registry with access to a virtual-care service
-- as of December 1, there were 82,088 Nova Scotians on the registry

---------------------------------------------------------------
Learning centres in Nova Scotia’s public schools will open on Tuesday, January 4, and Wednesday, January 5, to support students and families.

In consultation with public health, the Department made the decision to extend the holiday break by two days, with students returning to class Thursday, January 6. However, Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, said students whose needs are met through learning centres require additional support and schools and staff will be there to help.

“We heard from families about the impact of previous closures on students who use learning centres. We understand that some may want to send their children to school on those days, so staff will be there to support them,” said Minister Druhan.

Schools will be in contact with families whose children’s needs are met through learning centres and the staff who work there. Learning centres are used to co-ordinate and provide individual specialized programming and interventions to support students with disabilities and/or complex healthcare needs.

School staff will also report to work on January 4 and 5 for professional development.

The extended break allows families to monitor students for COVID-19 before they return to school, public health to assess COVID-19 in the province, and staff to undertake further professional development to support their teaching. It will also allow more time for families to book vaccination appointments for their children.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Les centres d'apprentissage dans les écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse seront ouverts le mardi 4 janvier et le mercredi 5 janvier à l'appui des élèves et des familles.

En consultation avec la Santé publique, le ministère a pris la décision de prolonger le congé des fêtes de deux jours. Les élèves retourneront donc en classe le jeudi 6 janvier. Toutefois, Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, affirme que les élèves qui dépendent des centres d'apprentissage ont besoin de soutien supplémentaire, et que les écoles et le personnel seront là pour les aider.

« Les familles nous ont fait part de l'impact des fermetures précédentes sur les élèves qui utilisent les centres d'apprentissage. Nous savons que certains parents voudront envoyer leurs enfants à l'école pendant ces deux jours, alors le personnel y sera pour les accueillir, affirme la ministre Druhan.

Les écoles communiqueront avec les familles dont les enfants utilisent les centres d'apprentissage et avec le personnel des centres. Les centres d'apprentissage servent à coordonner et à offrir des interventions et des programmes individuels spécialisés pour appuyer les élèves qui vivent avec un handicap ou qui ont des besoins complexes en matière de santé.

Le personnel sera sur place les 4 et 5 janvier pour du perfectionnement professionnel.

Le congé prolongé permet aux familles de surveiller les élèves pour voir s'ils présentent des symptômes de la COVID-19 avant de retourner à l'école, permet à la Santé publique d'évaluer la situation de la COVID-19 dans la province et permet au personnel de faire du perfectionnement professionnel supplémentaire à l'appui de leur enseignement. De plus, les familles auront plus de temps pour prendre rendez-vous pour faire vacciner leurs enfants.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Un plus grand nombre de personnes peuvent maintenant prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir une dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 en Nouvelle-Écosse.

À compter d'aujourd'hui 10 décembre, les personnes suivantes sont admissibles à recevoir la dose de rappel : 
-- Toute personne de 60 ans ou plus
-- Tous les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne, y compris les fournisseurs de soins de santé qui offrent des soins directs aux patients dans la communauté, peu importe l'intervalle entre les deux premières doses
-- Tous les aidants désignés, peu importe l'intervalle entre les deux premières doses

Les doses de rappel sont administrées au moins 168 jours après la série principale de vaccins. Les gens qui ont reçu deux doses du vaccin d'AstraZeneca ou le vaccin Janssen à une dose sont toujours admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel d'un vaccin à base d'ARNm.

On encourage les personnes de moins de 30 ans qui sont admissibles à une dose de rappel de choisir le vaccin de Pfizer. Le risque rare de myocardite et de péricardite associé aux vaccins à base d'ARNm semble plus courant après l'administration du vaccin de Moderna que du vaccin de Pfizer.

Les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne et les fournisseurs de soins de santé dans la communauté devront présenter une preuve de leur désignation et on les encourage à avoir leur permis professionnel, leur carte d'identité pour le travail ou une lettre de leur employeur. Les fournisseurs incluent : 
-- les médecins, les infirmières et les auxiliaires en soins continus qui travaillent en pratique communautaire ou qui assurent des soins à domicile;
-- les dentistes, les assistants dentaires, les hygiénistes dentaires et les denturologistes;
-- les pharmaciens, les assistants en pharmacie et les techniciens en pharmacie.

Toute personne admissible à recevoir une dose de rappel peut prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr ou en composant le numéro sans frais 1-833-797-7772.

Faits en bref
-- Aujourd'hui 10 décembre, environ 105 000 personnes de 60 ans ou plus seront admissibles à prendre rendez-vous pour leur dose de rappel.
-- Les doses de rappel sont offertes depuis le 23 novembre aux personnes de 70 ou plus, aux personnes ayant reçu deux doses du vaccin d'AstraZeneca et à certains travailleurs de la santé de première ligne.
-- On continue d'offrir les doses de rappel dans les communautés des Premières Nations, les communautés afro-néo-écossaises et les établissements de soins de longue durée à l'échelle de la province.
-- Depuis le 1er décembre, 25 % des enfants de 5 à 11 ans ont reçu leur première dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : En raison de problèmes techniques, les données sur la vaccination ne sont pas incluses dans le communiqué d'aujourd'hui ni sur le tableau de bord. Les données sur la vaccination seront mises à jour le vendredi 10 novembre.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 9 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 52 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 19 rétablissements. 

Il y a 29 cas dans le secteur du centre, 18 dans le secteur de l'est, 3 dans le secteur du nord et 2 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a une grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Trente-huit nouveaux cas sont signalés aujourd’hui, donc 59 cas en tout jusqu’à maintenant, et ils sont liés à la flambée de cas à l’Université St. Francis Xavier à Antigonish. Pour le moment, les personnes infectées éprouvent des symptômes très légers puisqu’il s’agit surtout de jeunes personnes entièrement vaccinées. Nous nous attendons à encore d’autres cas dans les prochains jours. L’université indique qu’environ 98 p. 100 de ses étudiants sont vaccinés. 

Rien ne prouve qu’il y a eu transmission dans les classes ou les résidences jusqu’à maintenant, et il n’y a pas de transmission secondaire dans la collectivité. L’enquête a révélé que l’essentiel de la transmission est survenu lors de petits rassemblements privés.  La plupart des cas sont liés aux personnes qui ont assisté à des activités entre les 2 et 5 décembre, sur le campus et à l’extérieur du campus. L’enquête se poursuit concernant l’application et le respect des mesures sanitaires. 

L’université, les étudiants et les gens de la localité sont très coopératifs et suivent les conseils de la Santé publique durant l’enquête, y compris en matière de tests de dépistage. Pour aider à dépister les cas, le centre de tests de dépistage de Santé Nouvelle-Écosse a augmenté ses heures d’ouverture, l’unité mobile de la Santé publique sera sur place au cours des prochains jours et Santé Nouvelle-Écosse et l’université distribuent des trousses de dépistage à utiliser à la maison.

« Pour le moment, notre priorité est d’aider les personnes qui sont atteintes par le virus et de contenir toute propagation possible sur le campus et dans la collectivité, a indiqué le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse.  Le vaccin fait son travail en limitant la propagation et en minimisant les symptômes; cette flambée de cas est très différente de ce que nous avons vu dans les autres flambées durant la quatrième vague.  Nous sommes moins inquiets dans ce cas-ci, compte tenu du taux élevé de vaccination et des symptômes que nous observons. Il est important que les gens de la localité et les étudiants suivent attentivement les mesures de santé publique, surtout le port du masque et l’isolement si c’est nécessaire, et qu’ils passent un test de dépistage s’ils ont des symptômes et s’ils ont participé à l’une ou l’autre des activités ou s’ils ont eu des contacts avec les personnes malades. Nous remercions les gens qui sont venus rapidement se faire tester. »

Le 8 décembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  
Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 194 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, neuf personnes sont hospitalisées, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

Le 8 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 454 tests.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 636 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 426. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Due to technical issues, immunization data is not included in today’s release or on the COVID-19 data dashboard. Immunization data will be updated Friday, December 10.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 9, Nova Scotia is reporting 52 new cases of COVID-19 and 19 recoveries. 

There are 29 cases in Central Zone, 18 cases in Eastern Zone, three cases in Northern Zone and two cases in Western Zone. There is a cluster of cases in a localized community in Northern Zone and there is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and parts of northern Nova Scotia.

There are 38 new cases being reported today, and 59 in total so far, related to the outbreak at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish. So far, those infected are experiencing very mild symptoms because the cases are mostly young people who are fully vaccinated. More new cases are expected in the coming days. The university reports that about 98 per cent of the student body is vaccinated. 

There has been no evidence of spread in classrooms or residences to date, and no secondary transmission in the community. Currently, the investigation has found the majority of spread happened in smaller, private gatherings.  Most cases are related to those who attended activities December 2-5, both on and off campus. There is an ongoing enforcement investigation. 

The university, students and community have been very cooperative and are complying with public health investigation advice, including testing. To help with finding cases, Nova Scotia Health’s testing centre has increased its hours of operation, the Public Health Mobile Unit will be in the community over the next several days and take-home test kits are being distributed by Nova Scotia Health and the university.

“Our priority right now is supporting those who are positive and containing any further spread on campus and in the community,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The vaccine is doing its job by limiting spread and keeping symptoms mild, so this outbreak is very different from what we’ve seen in previous wave 4 outbreaks.  Our concern level is lower because of wide-spread vaccinations and the symptoms we are seeing. It is important that community members and students diligently practice public health measures, especially masking and isolation if need be, and get tested if they have symptoms and attended any of the activities or had interactions with the people involved. A thank you to the people who have quickly come forward to be tested.”

On December 8, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures .
As of today, Nova Scotia has 194 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, nine people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

On December 8, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 4,454 tests.

Since August 1, there have been 2,636 positive COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,426 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to December 12, 2021

"Health and Wellness","Construction Completed on New Building for Kentville Family Medicine Residents","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Construction Completed on New Building for Kentville Family Medicine Residents 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Kentville is now home to a new facility to train family medicine residents.

Construction of a new building, located next to Valley Regional Hospital, is complete. It represents an investment of $1.47 million and will train 10 residents each year.

“Nova Scotia’s family medicine residency program is critical to training family doctors and to our recruitment efforts,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “If they have a positive experience and train in a high-quality facility, it increases the chance that they’ll want to stay and practice family medicine in Nova Scotia.” 

Six hospitals are receiving upgrades to accommodate additional spaces for family medicine residents. The remaining projects are in New Glasgow, Truro, Amherst, Antigonish and Inverness. Work is ongoing or complete at each location and ranges from renovating or creating space for training, adding a room for residents to stay when they are on call and new furniture or technology. The Valley Regional Hospital site was the only location that required construction of a new building. 

The building is expected to officially open in January, pending COVID-19 precautions allow workers to complete final touches on construction.

Quotes:
“We know that an effective way to recruit family doctors is by retaining the talent we are training right here in Nova Scotia. If we train residents locally, involve them in local communities so that they form connections and relationships, then they are more likely to stay in those supportive environments. This infrastructure supports a sustainable training program and reflects our commitment to family medicine education.” 
        - Dr. Kevin Orrell, Deputy Minister/CEO, Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

“This new building is the physical representation for the ‘home’ of family medicine training here in the Annapolis Valley. It represents the commitment and dedication of family medicine physicians and preceptors, Dalhousie University Department of Family Medicine, Nova Scotia Health and Department of Health and Wellness to the training of competent family medicine physicians who can provide care for Nova Scotians in all communities throughout Nova Scotia.”
        - Dr. Roop Conyers, Nova Scotia Health Authority Site Director, Dalhousie University, Family Medicine, Annapolis Valley Site

“The investment by government and community partners to construct a new training facility in Kentville compliments the excellent medical education our family medicine residents receive at our Annapolis Valley site. Thank you to all involved for their strong support and in particular, our colleagues at Nova Scotia Health.”
       - Dr. David Anderson, Dean, Dalhousie Faculty of Medicine

Quick Facts:
-- residents spend two years in a family practice where they follow patients and gain skills and experience in areas like maternal care, mental health and senior care
-- the residency training program is an effective recruitment tool; for example, 31 of 38 residents who trained at the Annapolis Valley site (2014-21) stayed to practice in the same or similar communities
-- family medicine training sites are located in North Nova (Truro, Amherst, New Glasgow), Cape Breton (Sydney and Inverness), Annapolis Valley, South West Nova (Yarmouth) and Halifax
-- residency training is a joint effort of the Department of Health and Wellness, Dalhousie Medical School, and Nova Scotia Health

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","34 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 18 cas résolus, flambée de cas à l’Université St. Francis Xavier","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--34 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 18 cas résolus, flambée de cas à l’Université St. Francis Xavier  
---------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 8 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 34 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 18 rétablissements. 

Il y a 14 cas dans le secteur de l'est, 13 dans le secteur du centre, 6 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a une grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

La Santé publique annonce également une flambée de cas à l’Université Saint Francis Xavier à Antigonish (secteur de l’est). Vingt et une personnes ont reçu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Le nombre de cas d’aujourd’hui comprend les 12 cas que l’université a annoncés mardi 7 décembre. Les résultats de certains cas liés à cette frambée sont arrivés après l’heure de tombée des statistiques et seront inclus dans le nombre de cas annoncés jeudi et dans la mise à jour du tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19.

La Santé publique collabore avec l'université pour freiner la transmission. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 7 décembre, on a avisé une école qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans son établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 162 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 11 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 4 aux soins intensifs.

Le 7 décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 565 tests.

Au 7 décembre, 1 673 788 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 796 117 sont une deuxième dose, et 34 366 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles. 

Le nombre de personnes qui ont reçu leur deuxième dose englobe les personnes qui ont reçue la deuxième dose à l’extérieur de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Ces dernières seront retirées des statistiques au cours des prochains jours pour assurer l’uniformité avec le nombre total de doses administrées dans la province. Cet ajustement ne changera pas le taux de vaccination de la Nouvelle-Écosse dans le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 585 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 407. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.
Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :
-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)
ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :
-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.
Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 8, Nova Scotia is reporting 34 new cases of COVID-19 and 18 recoveries. 

There are 14 cases in Eastern Zone, 13 cases in Central Zone, six cases in Northern Zone and one case in Western Zone. There is a cluster of cases in a localized community in Northern Zone and there is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and parts of northern Nova Scotia.

Public health is also reporting an outbreak at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish (Eastern Zone). Twenty-one people have tested positive for COVID-19. Today’s case count includes the 12 cases announced by the university Tuesday, December 7. Some cases connected to this outbreak came in after the cut-off for reporting and will be included in Thursday’s case and COVID-19 data dashboard updates.

Public health is working with the university to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On December 7, one school was notified of an exposure(s) at the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures .

As of today, Nova Scotia has 162 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 11 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

On December 7, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,565 tests.

As of December 7, 1,673,788 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 796,117 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 34,366 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose. 

The number of people who have received their second dose includes people who received the second outside Nova Scotia. Those will be removed over the coming days for consistency with the total number of doses administered in the province. This will not change Nova Scotia’s vaccination rate on the COVID-19 data dashboard.

Since August 1, there have been 2,585 positive COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,407 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to December 12, 2021

"Economic Development","Forestry Innovation Transition Trust Approves Project in Weymouth","ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT--Forestry Innovation Transition Trust Approves Project in Weymouth
---------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This release is on behalf of the Forestry Innovation Transition Trust
---------------------------------------------------------------
The board of the Forestry Innovation Transition Trust announced today, December 8, a $2.5 million investment in a project at Lewis Mouldings and Wood Specialties Ltd. in Weymouth.

The funding will allow the company to acquire two new pieces of equipment as it rebuilds a plant that was extensively damaged by fire earlier this year.

The equipment will be used to make high-value moulding products from low-value wood supply, such as tree tops. This work will support ecological and sustainable forestry practices, while also creating an economic benefit for woodlot owners.

To date, the Forestry Innovation Transition Trust has approved 10 projects, committing more than $25 million of the $50 million fund. The fund may be used by companies, organizations or post-secondary institutions working and researching in the forestry and biological resources sectors, and forestry workers can access funding for training. The three-member trustee board reviews the submissions and makes spending decisions.

Quotes:
“This project advances innovation in and renewal of the sector, furthering sustainable forestry practices in the province. With this equipment, Lewis Mouldings will produce high-value products from low-value wood fibre that would otherwise be unused, a goal of the Lahey Report. There is a strong market for these mouldings. The Trust is pleased to support this project and an important employer and contributor to the forestry sector.”
     - Rosalind Penfound, Chair, Forestry Innovation Transition Trust

“Lewis Mouldings is very appreciative of this support. This investment will help us purchase equipment to create high value products out of low-grade fibre. Ecological forestry demands that markets exist for forest products of varied quality and volumes. FITT's investment will help create such a market.”
     - Jamie Lewis, President, Lewis Mouldings and Wood Specialities Ltd.

Quick Facts
-- the Trust will remain open until March 31, 2025, or until funds have been spent
-- the trustees are Rosalind Penfound, Douglas Hall and David Saxton
-- projects may include the development of high-value products and/or new and enhanced business models, processes or services, inclusive economic growth opportunities and new ecological services
-- the Trust accepts applications from businesses, organizations and post-secondary institutions three times a year; the next round will be in the spring
-- forestry workers can apply at any time for funding to support training or retraining

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Investments to Attract, Retain Continuing Care Workers, Add More Beds","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Investments to Attract, Retain Continuing Care Workers, Add More Beds
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing about $57 million to support those working in continuing care, add more staff and open more beds more quickly to seniors waiting for long-term care.

Investments are aimed at hiring additional continuing care assistants and improving working conditions, improving care for seniors, and making empty beds in other facilities available to seniors.

“Seniors deserve dignity, and we will make sure that the supports are in place to care for them and give them what they need as they age,” said Premier Tim Houston. “They have given us so much, and it’s our turn to take care of them. Our vision for the future is twofold – a modern system that meets the needs of seniors and a skilled workforce to provide the care and support that seniors need. These investments will help us do just that.”
 
The single biggest investment is $22 million over the next two years to cover 100 per cent of tuition costs for over 2,000 students in continuing care assistant programs. Students will have the option of taking full- or part-time studies or participating in a new ‘work and learn’ training program that allows them to earn money while learning. Students in the new program will be in the workforce starting in February.

Other human resources investments in the next two and a half years include:
-- $8 million to provide long-term care homes with funding to offer their casual and part-time employees full-time positions or to hire more staff to provide direct care
-- $3.1 million to hire temporary staff through employment agencies while the Province builds a larger workforce 
-- $3.1 million in tuition rebates for current continuing care assistant students
-- $2.1 million to recruit continuing care assistants nationally and internationally
-- $1.4 million to improve staff scheduling and delivery of care
-- $1.3 million to increase professional development opportunities for staff
-- $1.3 million to attract workers to parts of the province where staffing is the most challenging
-- $630,000 to double the number of people (to 600) having their prior skills and experience recognized so they can apply for the many available positions in continuing care
-- $466,000 to provide injured or ill employees access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social work services and psychological services.

Investments over the next two and a half years to make more beds available to seniors waiting for long-term care include:
-- $6.1 million to convert and license beds in residential care facilities and assisted living facilities to nursing home level care
-- $5.9 million to license and fund 30 Veterans Affairs Canada beds for Nova Scotians who need them
-- $1.8 million to extend an agreement with Shannex and the Sisters of Charity to keep 23 temporary nursing home beds open for another year.

Quotes:
“There are hundreds of elderly parents and grandparents in hospital waiting for a bed in a long-term care home and even more waiting in community. These investments will help seniors get the care they deserve and alleviate pressures in other areas of the healthcare system. These are first steps and just part of our commitment to improving the continuing care system for employees and seniors needing care.”
     - Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care

“Our members are committed to ensuring that seniors receive safe, reliable, and high-quality care in the place they call home. Having sufficient human resources and ensuring that staff have a quality of work life that is meaningful and rewarding is essential to meeting this goal of continuing care excellence. Today’s announcements are exceptionally welcome news and represent another step forward in promoting positive change in Nova Scotia’s continuing care sector. We look forward to our continued partnership with the government in supporting implementation of many of these important initiatives.”
     - Mary Lee, President and CEO, Health Association of Nova Scotia

“CBBC Career College is excited to be part of this critical training initiative announced here today. Since 1958, we have helped transform the lives of thousands of graduates across Nova Scotia. The unique CCA delivery model designed by the college will introduce students to the career of continuing care assistant while they train. This early exposure will help new graduates integrate quickly into the career and will ultimately help address the staff shortages currently experienced across the entire provincial health sector.”
     - Henry Devlin, President and CEO, CBBC Career College

“Working as a continuing care assistant is so rewarding. The simplest of things like making someone a cup of tea can hugely impact their day. I have always thought of this line of work as bridging the gap between dependence and independence. We are there to make our clients’ lives as easy for them as possible while maintaining their dignity. Today’s investments show that our provincial government recognizes just how important and needed CCAs are in our healthcare system, as well as in the lives of those we care for daily.”
     - Tori Jackson, continuing care assistant and Nova Scotia Community College graduate

Quick Facts:
-- hiring more healthcare workers is a key government commitment and part of the Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister’s mandate
-- in addition to doctors and nurses, the government has committed to hiring 1,400 additional continuing care assistants
-- the government is also continuing work to renovate and build 2,500 new single-bed rooms over the next three years

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Mise à jour sur la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Mise à jour sur la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19
---------------------------------------------------------------
Un plus grand nombre de personnes seront bientôt admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

La Province a accepté toutes les nouvelles recommandations du Comité consultatif national de l’immunisation (CCNI) annoncées le 3 décembre au sujet des doses de rappel. Les dates précises de mise en oeuvre des mesures suivantes seront annoncées sous peu :
-- Offrir une dose de rappel aux personnes de 60 ans et plus, puis aux autres groupes d'âge en ordre décroissant.
-- Permettre aux travailleurs de la santé de première ligne, y compris les fournisseurs de services dans la communauté comme les dentistes et les pharmaciens, de prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir une dose de rappel, peu importe l'intervalle entre leur première dose et leur deuxième dose.
-- Augmenter l'intervalle entre la première dose et la deuxième dose de 28 jours à 8 semaines. Toutefois, les gens qui ont déjà pris rendez-vous pour leur deuxième dose 28 jours après la première dose pourront la recevoir à cet intervalle.

Les doses de rappel sont administrées au moins 168 jours après la série principale de vaccins.

« Nous allons progressivement offrir la dose de rappel à un plus grand nombre de personnes, mais notre principale priorité continuera d'être la vaccination des gens qui ont reçu une seule dose ou aucune dose du vaccin, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Il est important que tout le monde reçoive au moins deux doses du vaccin. »

Certaines personnes qui sont à risque plus élevé sont déjà admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel. Les personnes de 70 ans ou plus devraient recevoir une dose de rappel et les personnes immunodéficientes devraient recevoir une troisième dose dans le cadre de leur série principale de vaccins. Les personnes immunodéficientes seront également admissibles à recevoir une dose de rappel 168 jours après leur troisième dose.

La Province offrira des vaccins à base de vecteurs viraux aux personnes qui ne peuvent pas recevoir un vaccin à base d'ARNm. Un nombre limité de doses du vaccin Janssen seront offertes dans quelques cliniques la semaine prochaine. Les rendez-vous peuvent être fixés en ligne. Un lot de vaccins d'AstraZeneca arrivera également plus tard ce mois-ci, et des renseignements sur les endroits où les gens pourront obtenir ce vaccin seront publiés dès que possible.

Les gens qui choisissent de recevoir un vaccin à base de vecteurs viraux devraient considérer les choses suivantes :
-- Seules les personnes de 18 ans ou plus peuvent recevoir l'un de ces vaccins.
-- Ces vaccins sont moins efficaces que les vaccins à base d'ARNm.
-- Il n'y a pas de dose de rappel à base de vecteurs viraux pour l'instant; la dose de rappel doit être un vaccin à base d'ARNm.
-- Il existe un risque d'un trouble grave, mais rare de coagulation sanguine, soit la thrombocytopénie thrombotique immunitaire induite par le vaccin (TTIV), jusqu'à six semaines après l'administration du vaccin.

Le CCNI recommande également que les personnes de moins de 30 ans reçoivent le vaccin de Pfizer parce que le risque rare de myocardite et de péricardite associé aux vaccins à base d'ARNm semble plus courant après l'administration du vaccin de Moderna que du vaccin de Pfizer. La Nouvelle-Écosse n'offre pas le vaccin de Moderna aux personnes de 17 ans ou moins. On encourage fortement toute personne de 18 à 29 ans à recevoir le vaccin de Pfizer pour la première dose, la deuxième dose ou la dose de rappel.

Faits en bref
-- Environ 65 000 enfants de 5 à 11 ans sont admissibles à recevoir le vaccin contre la COVID-19.
-- Depuis le 1er décembre, presque 29 000 rendez-vous ont été pris pour ce groupe d'âge.
-- Depuis le 22 novembre, environ 39 700 doses de rappel ont été administrées ou sont prévues.

The Province has accepted all of the new booster recommendations announced on December 3 by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). Specific dates for implementing the following will be announced soon:
-- expand eligibility for a booster dose to include people who are 60 and older and then work backward in descending age groups
-- allow all frontline healthcare workers, including community providers like dentists and pharmacists, to schedule a booster dose regardless of the interval between their first two doses
-- increase the minimum interval between first and second doses from 28 days to eight weeks; any second dose appointments currently scheduled on a 28-day interval will be honoured.

Booster doses are administered at least 168 days after the primary series.

“While we will gradually roll out booster doses to more Nova Scotians, our first priority continues to be vaccinating people who have one dose or no doses of vaccine,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “It is important that everyone gets at least two doses of vaccine.”

Some people at greater risk of severe infection are already eligible for more than two doses. People who are 70 and older should get a booster dose and people who are immunocompromised should get a third primary series dose. Anyone who is immunocompromised will also become eligible for a booster dose 168 days after their third dose.

The Province will also make viral vector vaccines available this month for people who cannot get vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine. There will be limited doses of Janssen vaccine available at select clinics next week. Appointments can be booked online. A shipment of AstraZeneca vaccine is also expected later this month and information about where it will be offered will be released when available.

People who choose to receive a viral vector vaccine should be aware that:
-- they must be 18 or older to receive one of these vaccines
-- these vaccines are less effective than mRNA vaccines
-- there are no viral vector booster doses at this time; booster doses must be an mRNA vaccine
-- there is a risk of a serious but rare blood clotting disorder – vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) – up to six weeks after vaccination.

NACI also recommends that people under age 30 receive the Pfizer vaccine because the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with mRNA vaccines appears more common after Moderna than Pfizer vaccine. Nova Scotia has not made Moderna available to people 17 and under. Anyone 18 to 29 in Nova Scotia is strongly encouraged to receive the Pfizer vaccine for their first, second or booster doses.

Quick Facts:
-- there are about 65,000 children ages 5 to 11 who are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine
-- since December 1, almost 29,000 appointments have been scheduled for this age group
-- since November 22, there have been about 39,700 booster doses scheduled or administered

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19 connaît à l’heure actuelle un problème technique et sera mis à jour une fois le problème réglé.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 7 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 22 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 27 rétablissements. 

Dix-huit cas ont été dépistés dans le secteur du centre et quatre dans le secteur du nord. Il y a une grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Le 6 décembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 147 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 11 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 4 aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé, le 6 décembre, 2 783 tests effectués sur des Néo-Écossais.

Au 6 décembre, 1 657 071 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 793 905 sont une deuxième dose, et 28 489 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles. Le pourcentage de personnes ayant reçu une troisième dose est maintenant affiché sur le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19.

Le nombre de personnes qui ont reçu leur deuxième dose englobe les personnes qui ont reçue la deuxième dose à l’extérieur de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Ces dernières seront retirées des statistiques au cours des prochains jours pour assurer l’uniformité avec le nombre total de doses administrées dans la province. Cet ajustement ne changera pas le taux de vaccination de la Nouvelle-Écosse dans le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 552 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 389. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

The proposed Northern Pulp mill revitalization and new pulp effluent treatment plant project was registered for a Class II environmental assessment today, December 7.

The company’s registration document is available at: https://www.novascotia.ca/nse/ea/ .

The Department is now preparing draft terms of reference to guide the preparation of a Class II environmental assessment report by Northern Pulp Nova Scotia Corporation.

The terms of reference will be made public on December 21, and a 30-day public comment period will begin that day. The Environment Act’s environmental assessment regulations state December 23 to January 2 count as one day, so comments will be accepted until January 31, 2022. The Province will also consult directly with the Mi’kmaq.

Quick Facts:
-- on July 15, the Province announced that Northern Pulp’s mill revitalization and effluent treatment plant project must undergo a Class II environmental assessment
-- the company’s new proposal involves changes to the pulp mill itself, as well as the design and construction of a new effluent treatment plant
-- a Class II environmental assessment typically takes 275 calendar days to complete, not including the time it takes the company to prepare an environmental assessment report; the company has up to two years, outside of the review time, to prepare its environmental assessment report
-- in a Class II process, an environmental assessment panel is appointed to review the project and provide a report and recommendation to the minister
-- Northern Pulp formally withdrew its previous replacement effluent treatment project from the environmental assessment process on May 5, 2021

---------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 6, Nova Scotia is reporting 45 new cases of COVID-19 and 92 recoveries since the last update December 3. 

There are 38 cases in Central Zone, six cases in Northern Zone and one case in Eastern Zone. There is a cluster of cases in a localized community in Northern Zone and there is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and parts of northern Nova Scotia. 

Over the past three days, seven schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious.

As of today, Nova Scotia has 153 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 11 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,120 tests on December 3; 2,698 tests on December 4; and 2,684 tests on December 5.

As of December 5, 1,649,412 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 793,954 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 28,481 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 6 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 45 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 92 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 3 décembre. 

Il y a 38 cas dans le secteur du centre, 6 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'est. Il y a une grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé sept écoles d'une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures. 

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 153 cas actifs de COVID-19. Onze personnes sont hospitalisées, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 120 tests le 3 décembre, 2 698 tests le 4 décembre et 2 684 tests le 5 décembre.

Au 5 décembre, 1 649 412 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 793 954 étaient une deuxième dose, et 28 481 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles. Le pourcentage de personnes ayant reçu une troisième dose est maintenant affiché sur le tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 531 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 362. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Fifth Update on Vaccination Mandates","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Fifth Update on Vaccination Mandates
---------------------------------------------------------------
With final data in, Nova Scotia is reporting high rates of COVID-19 vaccination for employees under both the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for key sectors and the provincial vaccine mandate for civil servants.

Under the key sectors mandate, of those reporting, 99.2 per cent of 58,519 frontline workers in healthcare, continuing care, emergency health services, education and other sectors that work with vulnerable Nova Scotians have at least one dose of vaccine, and 97.0 per cent are fully vaccinated. There are 1,923 people still to report for various reasons.

There are 960 employees, or 1.3 per cent of the full workforce in those sectors, now on unpaid leave because they are not vaccinated or did not report their vaccine status.

Among civil servants who have reported their vaccination status, 99.1 per cent have at least one dose, and 97.2 per cent are fully vaccinated. There are 621 employees still to report for various reasons; most of them are currently on approved leaves of absence.

There are 93 civil servants now on unpaid leave because they are not vaccinated or didn’t report their vaccine status.

“I am very proud of the Nova Scotians who stepped up to ensure the people they serve are well-protected from this virus, especially given there is now a new variant of concern,” said Premier Tim Houston. “The civil service also showed its dedication to the people of the province with a very high rate of vaccination. The few in both mandates who didn’t get vaccinated have made their choice. It’s unfortunate they are no longer in the workplace, but I’m glad they won’t be putting patients, students, seniors and other vulnerable people at risk.”

The following have vaccination rates above 99 per cent:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority – 99.6
-- IWK Health Centre – 99.7
-- Education – 99.0
-- Correctional Services – 99.6
-- Emergency Health Services – 99.6
-- Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia – 99.4

A table with more detailed results of the two mandates, as of December 2, can be found at: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/covid-19-vaccine-mandate-numbers-en.pdf . Data collection continues. Questions about an organization’s data or contingency plans should be directed to that organization.

Under both the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for key sectors and the provincial civil service vaccination directive, all employees were required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30.

Employees who did not have a first dose by November 30 faced employment consequences, including unpaid leave, which began December 1. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subject to other health and safety measures, including testing.

Quick Facts:
-- under the COVID-19 vaccination mandate, employees were required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination up to 70 days after their first dose; those who were partially vaccinated may be subjected to other health and safety measures, including testing; those who did not have a first dose by November 30 were placed on unpaid leave
-- under the provincial civil service vaccination directive, employees had to have a first dose of the vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination up to 56 days after their first dose; those who did not have a first dose by November 30 faced employment consequences up to and including unpaid leave
-- 84.9 per cent of all Nova Scotians have at least one dose of vaccine and 81.3 per cent are fully vaccinated

---------------------------------------------------------------
Les données finales démontrent que le taux de vaccination contre la COVID-19 est très élevé chez les employés touchés par la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 dans les secteurs clés et dans la fonction publique provinciale.

Parmi les employés des secteurs clés qui ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal, 99,2 % des 58 519 personnes qui travaillent dans les domaines des soins de santé, des soins continus, des services de santé d'urgence, de l'éducation et autres employés qui travaillent avec des personnes vulnérables en Nouvelle-Écosse ont reçu au moins une dose du vaccin, et 97 % d'entre eux sont entièrement vaccinés. Il y a toujours 1 923 personnes qui n'ont pas déclaré leur statut vaccinal, pour différentes raisons.

En tout, 960 employés (1,3 % des effectifs dans ces secteurs) sont maintenant en congé non rémunéré parce qu'ils ne sont pas vaccinés ou qu'ils n'ont pas déclaré leur statut vaccinal.

Parmi les fonctionnaires provinciaux qui ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal, 99,1 % ont reçu au moins une dose et 97,2 % sont entièrement vaccinés. En tout, 621 employés n'ont pas déclaré leur statut vaccinal pour différentes raisons; la plupart d'entre eux sont actuellement en congé autorisé.

Au total, 93 fonctionnaires sont maintenant en congé non rémunéré parce qu'ils ne sont pas vaccinés ou qu'ils n'ont pas déclaré leur statut vaccinal.

« Je suis très fier des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui ont fait le nécessaire pour bien protéger ceux et celles qui les entourent contre ce virus, surtout puisqu'il y a maintenant un nouveau variant préoccupant, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. La fonction publique a également démontré son dévouement aux gens de la province par un taux élevé de vaccination. Les quelques personnes touchées par les politiques de la vaccination obligatoire qui n'ont pas reçu le vaccin ont fait leur choix. Il est regrettable que ces personnes ne soient plus au travail, mais je suis content qu'ils n'exposeront pas les patients, les élèves, les personnes âgées et toute autre personne vulnérable à des risques. »

Les groupes suivants ont des taux de vaccination supérieurs à 99 % :
-- Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse – 99,6 %
-- IWK Health Centre – 99,7 %
-- Éducation – 99 %
-- Services correctionnels – 99,6 %
-- Services de santé d'urgence – 99,6 %
-- Centres de traitement des troubles de l'audition et du langage – 99,4 %

Un tableau qui présente des données plus détaillées sur les taux de vaccination, en date du 2 décembre, se trouve au https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/covid-19-vaccine-mandate-numbers-fr.pdf . La collecte des données se poursuit. Toute question au sujet des données ou des plans de contingence d'un organisme doit être adressée à l'organisme en question.

En vertu de la politique sur la vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 dans les secteurs clés et de la directive concernant la vaccination de la fonction publique provinciale, tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre.

Les employés qui n'ont pas reçu leur première dose au 30 novembre ont subi des conséquences liées à leur emploi, y compris un congé non rémunéré, à compter du 1er décembre. Les personnes partiellement vaccinées peuvent devoir faire l'objet d'autres mesures de sécurité, y compris le test de dépistage.

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","Digital Training Leads to Quick Employment for Young Nova Scotians","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Digital Training Leads to Quick Employment for Young Nova Scotians
---------------------------------------------------------------
More than 100 young Nova Scotians have recently landed jobs or pursued further education in the province’s information technology (IT) sector after graduating from NPower Canada’s digital training program.

The 2021 year-end results of a $1.3 million provincial investment in NPower Canada show that program participants in Nova Scotia are finding employment opportunities in the IT sector faster than other regions in Canada.

As of October, 80 per cent of the program’s September graduates had already found jobs or pursued further education within four weeks of graduation. In other regions in Canada, it can take four to six months for NPower Canada graduates to reach the 80 per cent success target.

“We are thrilled with the success of the program and congratulate all the graduates,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “This supports our mandate to attract and support entrepreneurs and youth who can secure good jobs provincewide, and it demonstrates the strength of Nova Scotia’s thriving digital sector.”

NPower Canada helps reduce poverty in Canada by helping youth facing employment barriers launch IT careers. For example, Alex Andrew, of Dartmouth, is legally blind and thought that could prevent him from getting an IT job. NPower Canada accommodated his learning needs, and he successfully completed the program and found work in IT.

Up to 350 youth can enroll in a free 15-week technical and professional skills training program over a three-year period. Participants receive mentoring and other supports, including individual counselling, and graduate with industry-recognized credentials. Participants are supported for at least five years with career help, job placement, retention coaching, connections with industry mentors, and professional development.

NPower is currently recruiting for its winter cohort beginning in January 2022.

Quotes:
“NPower Canada is excited to equip growing numbers of Nova Scotian jobseekers with the digital skills required by local employers. Our program serves as a bridge between supply and demand, connecting Nova Scotians eager to join the digital economy with companies urgently seeking tech talent.”
     - Andrew Reddin, Chief Operating Officer, NPower Canada

“NPower Canada’s program allowed me to branch out my networks and tap into a job market I had not had experience in before, through new tech skills as well as interpersonal skills.”
     - Alex Andrew, NPower Junior IT Analyst Program graduate, May 2021

Quick Facts:
-- according to Digital Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia’s ICT (information and communications technology) and digital technologies sector is valued at $2.5 billion
-- Nova Scotia invested $1.3 million in NPower Canada through the Canada-Nova Scotia Labour Market Transfer Agreements
-- the full cost of the NPower program is $2.7 million; funding partners include the Government of Canada under the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, Google.org, the Future Skills Centre and RBC
-- since February 2021, NPower has supported 140 program participants in Nova Scotia
-- of those participants, some have voluntarily reported that they self-identify as: members of racialized communities – 71 (51 per cent); African Nova Scotian – 38 (21 per cent); members of 2SLGBTIQ+ communities – 25 (18 per cent); Indigenous and/or as First Nation, Metis or Inuit – 4 (three per cent); persons with disabilities – 33 (24 per cent); newcomers, including permanent residents, convention refugees, refugee claimants and work permit holders – 36 (26 per cent)

"Premier's Office / Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Premier to Attend Boston Tree Lighting, Conclude First International Mission","PREMIER’S OFFICE/COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE--Premier to Attend Boston Tree Lighting, Conclude First International Mission
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians and Bostonians are eagerly awaiting the Christmas tree lighting on the Boston Common tonight, December 2, at 8 p.m. AST.

“Nova Scotia will never forget the generosity shown by the City of Boston after the Halifax Explosion, and to say thank you, we send the annual gift of a beautiful Christmas tree,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Nova Scotia has had a strong relationship with Massachusetts for hundreds of years, cementing dependable ties along the way. We are not only proud to share this history, but also our business exports, our creative industries and our remarkable landmarks with our United States neighbours.”

Prior to the visit to Boston, Premier Houston travelled to Washington, D.C., to attend meetings with government, trade and business leaders as part of his first international trade and economic mission. Similar meetings were also held in Boston, and the mission will conclude with participation in the annual Holiday Lights event featuring the Nova Scotian tree.

The tree lighting ceremony is broadcast to an audience of more than 200,000 viewers and attracts 20,000 people to Boston Common. The Premier will be joined by Nova Scotia musicians Beòlach with Heather Rankin and R&B artist Keonté Beals.

This year’s tree, a 60-year-old, 48-foot white spruce, was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a non-profit organization that creates safe, supportive homes and meaningful work for people with disabilities. This organization has grown internationally to include over 150 communities in more than 30 countries around the world.

Quotes:
“The generous and selfless response offered by the people of Boston to the citizens of Halifax in the wake of the horror of the Halifax Explosion will never be forgotten. This year marks the 50th anniversary of this sincere gesture of thanks from the people of Nova Scotia to the City of Boston, and the fabulous 48-foot white spruce, donated by the wonderful community of L’Arche Cape Breton, is every bit worthy for this occasion.”
     - Rodger Cuzner, Consul General of Canada in Boston 

“We are thrilled to be featured on this year’s Holiday Lights show. With this year’s tree coming from Orangedale, it feels like a great time to feature Cape Breton tunes on the broadcast. I have performed in Boston the most of all the cities in the United States, and I look forward to seeing some of my American friends.”
     - Wendy MacIsaac, artist, Beòlach

Quick Facts:
-- 2021 marks the 104th anniversary of the Halifax Explosion and the 50th anniversary of the Tree for Boston tradition 
-- the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917, when the Norwegian vessel SS Imo collided with the SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship laden with explosives, in Halifax Harbour
-- Nova Scotia exported $3.8 billion in goods to the United States in 2019; trade with the U.S. supports 26,700 Nova Scotian jobs
-- the Tree for Boston event builds participation in several trade initiatives planned for 2022 in support of the Nova Scotia craft sector

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 2 décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 40 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 29 rétablissements. 

Il y a 20 cas dans le secteur du nord, 18 dans le secteur du centre et 2 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a une nouvelle grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Le 1er décembre, on a avisé trois écoles d'une ou de plusieurs expositions au virus dans leur établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.   

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 214 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 13 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont cinq aux soins intensifs.

Le 1er décembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 330 tests.

Au 1er décembre, 1 643 212 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 792 716 sont une deuxième dose, et 24 844 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 466 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 236. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

"Justice","Directive Strengthens Street Checks Ban","JUSTICE--Directive Strengthens Street Checks Ban
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Province has strengthened the existing ban on street checks to provide clearer direction to police and ensure no Nova Scotian is subjected to the practice.

Attorney General and Justice Minister Brad Johns today, December 2, issued a new law enforcement directive to address concerns about an earlier directive that potentially allowed police to continue to illegally collect and record identifying information of individuals.

The new directive removes the term “suspicious activity” and replaces it with “reasonable suspicion” in cases where a crime is about to occur or has occurred. Reasonable suspicion is the legal standard to be used by police to detain individuals suspected of unlawful activity.

“Street checks are banned, and we have taken additional steps to better protect racialized communities by making changes to the directive that reflect the feedback we received,” said Minister Johns. “Today’s change makes it clear that police must use the criminal law standard of reasonable suspicion before detaining a person or collecting identifying information without their consent.”

The updated directive comes after consultation with both the African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition (ANSDPAD) and police. It supports government’s commitment to implement the recommendations of the 2019 Wortley Report on street checks and ensure street checks end.

Quotes:
“The ANSDPAD Coalition is pleased that the practice of street checks has been found to be illegal and has been banned by the provincial directive. We believe that police behaviour should be strictly guided by what is legal and believe that the current directive is an improvement. Ultimately, however, we need to fully address the historical problems that exist with policing Black bodies.  We have proposed the need for an African Nova Scotian Policing Strategy and look forward to working with justice and policing officials to improve policing practices for all Nova Scotians.”
     - Vanessa Fells, Director of Operations, African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent

“Police leaders in Nova Scotia share the provincial commitment to make required changes in public safety to address concerns about systemic racism and build trust with the community. Gathering information is an essential part of our duty to public safety, and the new directive will ensure fair and consistent policing across the province while allowing police to carry out required duties to ensure public safety.”
     - Chief Robert Walsh, President, Nova Scotia Chiefs of Police Association

Quick Facts:
-- the independent review of street checks in the Halifax Regional Municipality by Prof. Scot Wortley in 2019 found that African Nova Scotians were six times more likely to be randomly stopped or street checked by police than the rest of the population

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","New Long-term Care Facility for Liverpool","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--New Long-term Care Facility for Liverpool
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new long-term care home in Liverpool will increase single-bed rooms and improve accommodations in the area. 

The new facility will include 96 beds and replace Queens Manor and Hillsview Acres, which currently have a combined total of 90 beds. A request for proposals will be issued for a project manager who will support design and construction.

“There are long wait lists for long-term care and that’s not acceptable. That’s why we are taking action and building or renovating more than 2,500 new single-bed rooms over three years,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “This new facility in Liverpool will be among the first of these projects. With the addition of these beds, we can provide peace of mind and improve access to care for more Nova Scotians.”

The facility will be built to the highest standard across Canada for long-term care facilities. All residents will have single rooms and washrooms. Planning and design work will begin immediately once a project manager is chosen. Construction will start once the design is approved.

Quick Facts:
-- the government is committed to renovating and building more than 2,500 new single-bed rooms over three years, including all projects already announced in 2021
-- construction has already started on Villa Acadienne in Meteghan, Mahone Bay Nursing Home in Mahone Bay and Kiknu in Eskasoni
-- design work continues for long-term care facilities attached to the healthcare projects in North Sydney and New Waterford 
-- as stated in the Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister’s mandate letter, the government will support hiring 1,400 more continuing care assistants and 600 more nurses to ensure all residents of long-term care facilities get at least 4.1 hours of care

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","35 New Cases of COVID-19, 31 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--35 New Cases of COVID-19, 31 Recoveries 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Today, December 1, Nova Scotia is reporting 35 new cases of COVID-19 and 31 recoveries. 

There are 16 cases in Northern Zone, 16 cases in Central Zone and three cases in Western Zone. There is a new cluster of cases in a localized community in Northern Zone, and there is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and parts of northern Nova Scotia. 

On November 30, six schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures 

As of today, Nova Scotia has 203 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 15 people are in hospital, including eight in ICU.

On November 30, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,013 tests.

As of November 30, 1,638,694 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 791,542 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 22,548 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 2,426 positive COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,207 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to December 12, 2021

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 1er décembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 35 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 31 rétablissements. 

Il y a 16 cas dans le secteur du nord, 16 dans le secteur du centre et 3 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a une nouvelle grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Le 30 novembre, on a avisé six écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures. 

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 203 cas actifs de COVID-19. Quinze personnes sont hospitalisées, dont huit aux soins intensifs.

Le 30 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 013 tests.

Au 30 novembre, 1 638 694 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 791 542 étaient une deuxième dose, et 22 548 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 426 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 207. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Les demandes sont acceptées pour l’Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés","AÎNÉS ET SOINS DE LONGUE DURÉE--Les demandes sont acceptées pour l’Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés
---------------------------------------------------------------
Les personnes âgées de 65 ans et plus peuvent maintenant demander une nouvelle Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés qui les aidera à rester dans leur propre maison plus longtemps. Les demandes sont acceptées à compter d’aujourd’hui 1er décembre.

La Province a annoncé récemment qu’elle s'acquitte de son engagement à aider les personnes âgées à vivre dans leur maison plus longtemps en investissant jusqu'à 32 millions de dollars par année dans l'allocation.

L’allocation fournit jusqu’à 500 $ aux personnes admissibles qui ont besoin d’aide pour certaines choses à faire à la maison, par exemple le déneigement, des petites rénovations, l’entretien du gazon ou la livraison de l’épicerie.

« Nous savons que de nombreux aînés en Nouvelle-Écosse font face à certains défis à la maison, et souvent il suffit d'un coup de main avec des petits travaux ici et là, affirme Barbara Adams, ministre des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée. Cet investissement permettra aux personnes âgées d'entretenir leur maison et de pouvoir y demeurer avec la dignité qu'elles méritent. »

Pour être admissibles, les personnes âgées doivent vivre de façon indépendante dans une maison dont elles sont propriétaires ou locataires, et le revenu net annuel du ménage ne doit pas dépasser 37 500 $.

Les demandes peuvent être envoyées en ligne, par courriel ou par télécopieur. Le formulaire de demande est disponible en ligne (en anglais seulement) à l'adresse https://beta.novascotia.ca/apply-help-household-costs-seniors-care-grant. La version papier du formulaire sera disponible dans les centres Accès Nouvelle-Écosse et dans les bureaux des députés. Vous pouvez également composer le 1-800-670-4357 pour demander qu'on vous envoie un formulaire par la poste. La date limite de présentation des demandes est le 31 mai 2022, et les fonds peuvent être utilisés jusqu'au 30 novembre 2022.

Le gouvernement offre également des programmes pour aider les personnes âgées à payer les frais de chauffage et les impôts fonciers.

« C’est un programme fantastique pour les aînés. Tous les jours, il est inquiétant et difficile pour beaucoup d’aînés en Nouvelle-Écosse de maintenir la qualité de vie nécessaire pour rester suffisamment en santé, mentalement et physiquement, pour rester dans leur propre maison plus longtemps. Pour moi, l’Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés est tellement utile, elle élimine le fardeau et l’inquiétude, que ce soit pour tenter d’aller à un rendez-vous médical ou d’aller faire l’épicerie, ou pour des corvées à faire à la maison. Cette aide supplémentaire a une valeur inestimable, elle est très appréciée et elle apporte une tranquillité d’esprit incroyable. »
     – Marion Cranston, personne âgée d’Halifax

« Le réseau des agences de Home Services Nova Scotia aide les aînés qui ont besoin de faire des petits travaux à la maison. Les services sont assurés par des personnes ayant une déficience. Cette nouvelle Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés permettra à plus d’aînés néo-écossais d’obtenir l’aide dont ils ont besoin pour s’occuper de leur propriété et créera des possibilités d’emploi dans la province. »
     – Mike Townsend, directeur général, Directions Council for Vocational Services Society 

« Prescott Group est ravi d’être un partenaire d’aiguillage pour ce programme, par le truchement de Nova Scotia Home Services. Prescott Group propose une gamme de services pour aider les aînés à rester dans leur maison, par exemple, des visites, des petites courses ou des petits travaux autour de la maison, ou même du ménage. Pour les aînés dans nos localités, le fait d’avoir un peu plus d’argent se traduit par plus de possibilités pour nous d’aider ceux qui ont besoin d’aide, de faciliter leur vie un peu et, en même temps, de fournir un emploi à salaire équitable à des personnes ayant des déficiences. »
     – Alice Evans, directrice générale, Prescott Group

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Seniors Care Grant Open for Applications","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Seniors Care Grant Open for Applications
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians aged 65 and older can now apply for a new Seniors Care Grant that will help them stay in their own homes longer. Applications opened today, December 1.

The Province recently announced that it is following through on its commitment to help seniors stay in their homes longer by investing up to $32 million each year in the grant.

The grant provides up to $500 in funding for eligible seniors who need help around their homes. Covered expenses include snow removal, small household repairs, lawn care, grocery delivery and other needs.

“We know many Nova Scotia seniors face challenges staying in their homes, and often they just need a helping hand with small jobs here and there,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “This investment makes it easier for older Nova Scotians to maintain and afford their homes with the dignity they deserve.”

To qualify, older Nova Scotians must live independently in a home they own or rent and have an annual household income of $37,500 or less.

Applications can be submitted online, by mail or by fax. The application is available online at: https://beta.novascotia.ca/apply-help-household-costs-seniors-care-grant . Print applications will be available at Access Nova Scotia Centres and MLA offices, or by calling 1-800-670-4357 to request that one be mailed. The deadline for applications is May 31, 2022, and funds can be used through November 30, 2022.

The government also offers support programs to help seniors with the costs of heating and property tax.

Quotes:
“This is a fantastic program for seniors. It is a daily concern and challenge for many older Nova Scotians to maintain the quality of living that is necessary to stay mentally and physically healthy enough to stay in their own homes for longer. I see this Seniors Care Grant as being so very helpful, taking a lot of the burden and worry away, whether it’s trying to go for medical appointments or grocery shopping, or having difficult chores around the home. This extra help is immeasurable, very appreciated and provides incredible peace of mind.”
     - Halifax senior citizen Marion Cranston

“The Home Services Nova Scotia network of agencies supports seniors who need work completed around their homes. These services are provided by individuals having a disability. This new Seniors Grant Program will allow more older Nova Scotians to get the assistance they need to look after their properties and create employment opportunities across the province.”
     - Mike Townsend, Executive Director, Directions Council for Vocational Services Society

“Prescott Group is delighted to be a referral partner for this program via Nova Scotia Home Services. At Prescott, we provide a range of services to help seniors stay in their homes, from social visits to small errands and light yardwork or cleaning. Having more income available for seniors in our communities means more possibilities for us to help those people in need, making their lives a little easier and at the same time providing fair-wage employment to people with disabilities.”
     - Alice Evans, Executive Director, Prescott Group

Quick Facts:
-- only one grant of up to $500 will be available to each eligible household each year; seniors need to apply for the grant once per year
-- people 65 and older who rent or own their home are eligible to receive the grant; the property or lease must be in their name

----------------------------------------------------------------
À compter d'aujourd'hui, des restrictions s'appliquent aux déplacements à l'extérieur de la province pour les enfants de 11 ans et moins aux fins de participation à des activités sportives, artistiques et culturelles.

Les enfants de 11 ans et moins de l'extérieur de la province ne pourront pas non plus venir en Nouvelle-Écosse pour participer à ces activités. 

« Il y a de la transmission entre les enfants qui participent à de tels événements. Puisque la vaccination pour ce groupe d'âge ne fait que commencer, nous devons prendre cette mesure pour protéger nos enfants et les autres, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. J'encourage fortement les parents à prendre rendez-vous pour faire vacciner leurs enfants dès que possible. Il s'agit de la meilleure façon de se protéger contre le virus, et la meilleure façon de réduire les restrictions. »

Les particuliers, les entreprises et les organismes de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne peuvent pas organiser de matchs, de compétitions et de tournois ou de performances artistiques et culturelles auxquels participent des enfants de 11 ans et moins de l'extérieur de la province. Les enfants de 11 ans et moins ne peuvent pas non plus participer à ce genre d'activité à l'extérieur de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Il n'est pas possible non plus pour les enfants de s'isoler ou de passer un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 après un déplacement pour participer à de telles activités. Cette restriction demeurera en place au moins jusqu'au début janvier et elle sera réévaluée à ce moment.

Les enfants peuvent continuer de se déplacer pour assister à ce genre d'activité à titre de spectateurs. Ils peuvent également continuer de se déplacer pour des entraînements, des leçons et des répétitions. Il s'agit d'activités à plus faible risque, car les enfants interagissent toujours avec le même groupe de personnes.

Toutes les autres restrictions sur les déplacements demeurent en place. Des renseignements supplémentaires se trouvent au https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/travel/fr

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Travel Restriction for Children Age 11 and Younger Participating in Sports or Arts and Culture Events","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Travel Restriction for Children Age 11 and Younger Participating in Sports or Arts and Culture Events
----------------------------------------------------------------
Effective immediately, there are restrictions on out-of-province travel for children age 11 and younger for the purposes of participating in sports or arts and culture events.

Children age 11 and younger are also restricted from entering Nova Scotia for these activities. 

“We are seeing cases spreading among children through these types of events. Given that vaccination for this age group is only just starting to roll out, we need to take this step to help keep our children and others safe,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nova Scotia. “I strongly encourage parents to book vaccination appointments for their children as soon as possible. It is our best defence against this virus and our best path forward to living with fewer restrictions.”

Individuals, businesses and organizations in Nova Scotia cannot host sports games, competitions and tournaments or arts and culture performances that include children 11 and younger from outside the province as participants. They also cannot participate in these types of events outside Nova Scotia.

Children cannot self-isolate after travelling or get tested for COVID-19 in order to participate in these types of events. This restriction will remain in place until at least early January and will be re-evaluated then.

Children can continue to travel to attend these types of events as spectators. They can continue to travel for regular practices, lessons and rehearsals, which is lower risk because they are interacting with the same group all the time.

All other travel restrictions remain in place. They are outlined at: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/travel/ .

"Health and Wellness","Nova Scotia Marks HIV/AIDS Awareness Week","HEALTH AND WELLNESS--Nova Scotia Marks HIV/AIDS Awareness Week
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is marking two HIV/AIDS awareness weeks in November and December and World AIDS Day today, December 1.

They honour people living with HIV/AIDS and those who have lost their lives to AIDS worldwide. HIV/AIDS Awareness Week is November 24 to December 1 and Indigenous AIDS Awareness Week is December 1 to 7.

A red ribbon flag was raised at Province House today on World AIDS Day.

The theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities. End AIDS. End Pandemics. It highlights the need to end the inequities, stigma and discrimination that worsen pandemics like HIV/AIDS and COVID-19.

“We know the pandemic has been difficult for many people, including people either currently living with HIV/AIDS or at risk of contracting the virus,” said Health and Wellness  Minister Michelle Thompson. “There has been great progress in recent decades, but we need to further reduce stigma and ensure we don’t leave anyone behind.”

The Nova Scotia Advisory Commission on AIDS is an arm’s-length agency that provides advice to the provincial government on HIV/AIDS and related matters.

Quotes:
“This is a time to recognize the important work that remains to be done. This includes making it easier to access testing, treatment and prevention measures. We must also reduce the many forms of stigma and inequities that increase the risk of HIV infection.”
     - Michelle Proctor-Simms, Director, Nova Scotia Advisory Commission on AIDS

Quick Facts:
-- 19 new cases of HIV were reported to public health in Nova Scotia in 2019; case data is not yet available for 2020 and 2021
-- the average yearly incidence is about 15 new cases
-- 922 HIV cases have been diagnosed in Nova Scotia since 1983, when reporting began, until the end of 2019 (this does not include those who were first diagnosed outside of Nova Scotia)
-- the government increased access to HIV prevention medication by adding it to provincial pharmacare programs in July 2018

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","61 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 31 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--61 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 31 cas résolus 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 30 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 61 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 31 rétablissements. 

Il y a 33 cas dans le secteur du nord, 24 dans le secteur du centre et 4 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a une nouvelle grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

« Il y a une certaine transmission communautaire dans la région nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse, mais l'augmentation du nombre de cas dans cette région hier et aujourd'hui est liée à une grappe de cas dans un groupe défini de personnes largement non vaccinées, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Le groupe collabore avec les représentants locaux de la Santé publique et les cas semblent être restreints à ce groupe. »

Il n'y a aucun nouveau cas à signaler au foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge. Un total de 32 résidents et 11 membres du personnel du foyer de soins ont contracté la COVID-19, et quatre de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la Santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 29 novembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures. 

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 200 cas actifs de COVID-19. Treize personnes sont hospitalisées, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

Le 29 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 999 tests.

Au 29 novembre, 1 635 675 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 790 742 étaient une deuxième dose, et 20 858 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 392 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 176. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","61 New Cases of COVID-19, 31 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--61 New Cases of COVID-19, 31 Recoveries 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 30, Nova Scotia is reporting 61 new cases of COVID-19 and 31 recoveries. 

There are 33 cases in Northern Zone, 24 cases in Central Zone and four cases in Western Zone. There is a new cluster of cases in a localized community in Northern Zone and there is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and parts of northern Nova Scotia.

“While there is a low level of ongoing community transmission in the northern part of Nova Scotia, the higher case numbers we’re seeing in the area yesterday and today are associated with a cluster of cases in a defined group of largely unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “They are co-operating with local public health and the cases appear to be contained within this group.”

There are no new cases at the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash. A total of 32 residents and 11 staff members at the home have tested positive, and four of the infected residents have died. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On November 29, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures 

As of today, Nova Scotia has 200 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 13 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

On November 29, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,999 tests.

As of November 29, 1,635,675 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 790,742 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 20,858 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 2,392 positive COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,176 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to December 12, 2021

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Fourth Update on Vaccine Mandates","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Fourth Update on Vaccine Mandates
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 30, is the last day for employees under two vaccination mandates to provide their employers proof of vaccination for COVID-19.

Under both the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for key sectors and the provincial civil service vaccination directive, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subject to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by today will face employment consequences, including unpaid leave, which will begin tomorrow, December 1.

Latest data shows 99 per cent of frontline healthcare, continuing care, paramedics, education employees’ and others in the COVID-19 vaccine mandate have at least one dose of vaccine. It also shows 99 per cent of provincial government employees have at least one dose. 

“Nova Scotians are showing they care about the people they serve by getting vaccinated and keeping them safe,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I’m told there will be few disruptions to service as vaccination rates are very high.”

Government is working with all organizations to monitor and address any impacts. All organizations have contingency plans, but most are anticipating they will not be needed.

The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development says there may be some disruption to school busing in Halifax Regional Centre for Education (HRCE) and small pockets in other education regions. School regions are working with their bus providers and staff to mitigate impacts to students and families. In HRCE, drivers may be assigned to new routes and one driver may need to cover an additional route before and after school, leading to potential delays for students. Families will be notified if there is a change or delay to their child’s bus route.

The Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care is working closely with long-term care facilities and home-care agencies to ensure residents and seniors continue to get the care they need. While vaccination rates are high across the sector, existing workforce shortages mean that even a small number of unvaccinated staff could result in a facility or agency not being able to accept new residents or seniors. Contingency plans could include using employment agencies and travelling nursing staff and offering part-time and casual staff full-time employment.

Most sectors or organizations under the COVID-19 vaccination mandate are reporting first or fully vaccinated rates of:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority: 96.5 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 95 per cent on November 24), 3.1 per cent partially vaccinated, 23,422 total employees with 91.3 per cent reporting (up from 90 per cent)
-- IWK Health Centre: 99.2 per cent (no change), 0.6 per cent partially vaccinated, 3,573 total employees with 99.4 per cent reporting (no change)
-- long-term care: 96.1 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 95 per cent), 2.1 per cent partially vaccinated, 11,027 total employees with 98.0 per cent reporting (up from 95 per cent)
-- home care: 95.3 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 95), three per cent partially vaccinated, 3,821 total employees with 97.1 per cent reporting (up from 97 per cent)
-- education: 97.8 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 97 per cent), 1.3 per cent partially vaccinated, 18,726 total employees with 96.4 per cent reporting (up from 90 per cent)
-- Emergency Health Services (EHS): 98.8 per cent fully vaccinated (no change), 0.8 per cent partially vaccinated, 1,353 total employees with 100 per cent reporting (up from 92 per cent)
-- adult day programs (Seniors and Long-term Care): 94.6 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 94 per cent), no employees partially vaccinated, 76 total employees with 97.4 per cent reporting
-- correctional services: 98.7 per cent fully vaccinated (no change), 0.8 per cent partially vaccinated, 527 total employees with 99.4 per cent reporting
-- Community Services (Disability Support Program and Child and Youth Caring Program): 93.9 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 93 per cent), 4.4 per cent partially vaccinated, 8,269 total employees with 97.2 per cent reporting
-- daycares: 94.5 per cent full vaccinated (up from 93 per cent), 3.8 per cent partially vaccinated, with 97.1 per cent of facilities reporting
-- Hearing and Speech NS: 99.4 per cent fully vaccinated (no change), no employees partially vaccinated, 173 total employees with 100 per cent reporting.

Twenty exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccination mandate were granted:
-- two granted of 134 human rights exemption requests
-- 18 granted of 49 medical exemption requests

The data being reported is as of November 29. Data collection continues today until 11:59 p.m. and a final update on the mandates will be provided by the end of the week.

No further information will be available until the final update.

Quick Facts:
-- under the COVID-19 vaccination mandate employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination up to 70 days after their first dose; those who are partially vaccinated may be subjected to other health and safety measures, including testing; those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will be placed on unpaid leave
-- under the provincial civil service vaccination directive, employees must have at first dose of the vaccine by November 30 with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination up to 56 days after their first dose; those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will face employment consequences up to and including unpaid leave
-- 84.6 per cent of Nova Scotians have at least one dose of vaccine with 81.3 per cent fully vaccinated

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Quatrième mise à jour sur la vaccination obligatoire","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Quatrième mise à jour sur la vaccination obligatoire
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 30 novembre est la date limite où les employés sujets à la vaccination obligatoire doivent fournir à leur employeur une preuve de vaccination contre la COVID-19.

En vertu de la politique sur la vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 dans les secteurs clés et de la directive concernant la vaccination de la fonction publique provinciale, tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre. Les personnes partiellement vaccinées pourront devoir faire l'objet d'autres mesures de sécurité, y compris le test de dépistage. Les employés qui n'auront pas reçu leur première dose aujourd'hui subiront des conséquences liées à leur emploi, y compris un congé non rémunéré, à compter de demain, le 1er décembre.

Les données les plus récentes démontrent que 99 % des employés dans les domaines des soins de santé de première ligne, des soins continus, des soins paramédicaux, de l'éducation et autres domaines touchés par la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 ont reçu au moins une dose du vaccin. Elles démontrent également que 99 % des employés du gouvernement provincial ont reçu au moins une dose du vaccin.

« Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse montrent qu'ils se préoccupent des personnes auxquelles ils offrent des services en se faisant vacciner pour les protéger, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. On me dit qu'il y aura peu d'interruptions de services puisque le taux de vaccination est très élevé. »

Le gouvernement travaille en collaboration avec tous les organismes pour surveiller et aborder toute répercussion. Tous les organismes ont mis en place un plan de contingence, mais la plupart d'entre eux ne croient pas que ces plans seront nécessaires.

Selon le ministère de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, il pourrait y avoir des interruptions au service de transport scolaire au sein du Centre régional pour l'éducation Halifax (CREH) et à quelques autres endroits localisés. Les écoles travaillent avec les fournisseurs de service de transport scolaire et leur personnel pour atténuer les répercussions sur les élèves et les familles. Au sein du CREH, les conducteurs d'autobus pourraient devoir prendre de nouvelles routes, et un conducteur pourrait devoir prendre une route supplémentaire avant et après l'école, ce qui pourrait entraîner des retards pour les élèves. Les familles seront avisées si la route de l'autobus scolaire de leur enfant sera différente ou s'il y aura des retards.

Le ministère des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée travaille en étroite collaboration avec les établissements de soins de longue durée et les organismes de soins à domicile pour faire en sorte que les résidents et les personnes âgées continuent de recevoir les soins dont ils ont besoin. Bien que le taux de vaccination soit élevé dans ce secteur, la pénurie actuelle de main-d'oeuvre signifie que même un faible nombre d'employés non vaccinés pourrait faire qu'un établissement ou un organisme ne soit pas en mesure d'accepter de nouveaux résidents ou aînés. Les plans de contingence pourraient inclure l'utilisation d'agences de placement et de personnel infirmier itinérant et l'offre d'emplois à temps partiel ou d'emplois à temps plein aux employés occasionnels.

La plupart des secteurs ou des organismes sujets à la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 déclarent les taux de vaccination suivants :
-- Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse : 96,5 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 95 % le 24 novembre), 3,1 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 23 422  employés) et 91,3 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (comparé à 90 %)
-- IWK Health Centre : 99,2 % sont entièrement vaccinés (aucun changement), 0,6 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 3 573 employés) et 99,4 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (aucun changement)
-- Soins de longue durée : 96,1 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 95 %), 2,1 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 11 027 employés) et 98 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (comparé à 95 %)
-- Soins à domicile : 95,3 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 95 %), 3 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 3 821 employés) et 97,1 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (comparé à 97 %)
-- Éducation : 97,8 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 97 %), 1,3 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 18 726 employés) et 96,4 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (comparé à 90 %)
-- Services de santé d'urgence : 98,8 % sont entièrement vaccinés (aucun changement), 0,8 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 1 353 employés) et 100 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (comparé à 92 %)
-- Programmes de jour pour adultes (Aînés et Soins de longue durée) : 94,6 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 94 %), aucun employé n'est partiellement vacciné (total de 76 employés) et 97,4 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal
-- Services correctionnels : 98,7 % sont entièrement vaccinés (aucun changement), 0,8 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 527 employés) et 99,4 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal
-- Services communautaires (Programme de soutien aux personnes handicapées et Programme de soins pour les jeunes) : 93,9 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 93 %), 4,4 % sont partiellement vaccinés (total de 8 269 employés) et 97,2 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal
-- Services de garde d'enfants : 94,5 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 93 %), 3,8 % sont partiellement vaccinés et 97,1 % des établissements ont déclaré le statut vaccinal de leurs employés
-- Centres de traitement des troubles de l'audition et du langage : 99,4 % sont entièrement vaccinés (aucun changement), aucun employé n'est partiellement vacciné (total de 173 employés) et 100 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal

Vingt exemptions à la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 ont été accordées :
-- 2 demandes sur 134 pour des exemptions liées aux droits de la personne
-- 18 demandes sur 49 pour des exemptions liées à des raisons médicales

Les données sont à jour au 29 novembre. La collecte de données se poursuit aujourd'hui jusqu'à 23 h 59 et une mise à jour finale sera publiée d'ici la fin de la semaine.

Aucun autre renseignement ne sera publié avant la mise à jour finale.

Faits en bref
-- Selon la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19, tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre et sont tenus de présenter une preuve de vaccination complète 70 jours après leur première dose. Les personnes partiellement vaccinées pourront devoir faire l'objet d'autres mesures de sécurité, y compris le test de dépistage. Les employés qui n'auront pas reçu leur première dose au 30 novembre seront mis en congé non rémunéré.
-- Selon la directive concernant la vaccination de la fonction publique provinciale, tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre et sont tenus de présenter une preuve de vaccination complète 56 jours après leur première dose. Les employés qui n'auront pas reçu leur première dose au 30 novembre subiront des conséquences liées à leur emploi, y compris un congé non rémunéré.
-- Un total de 84,6 % des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont reçu au moins une dose du vaccin et 81,3 % sont entièrement vaccinés.

"Community Services","Province Ending Birth Alerts","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Province Ending Birth Alerts
---------------------------------------------------------------
The government is ending the use of birth alerts, effective immediately, and will provide expectant families with additional support to help access the programs and services they need.

This change follows a recommendation of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and supports efforts to strengthen family supports within communities across the province.

“I recognize the troubling concerns with birth alerts and how they have a disproportionate effect on African Nova Scotian and Indigenous families and other marginalized women,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “Going forward, we will have a stronger focus on connecting expectant parents and families with supports to ensure the best possible start for children.”

Birth alerts are written notifications by child welfare agencies to hospital staff regarding an expectant parent when significant risk issues are present during the pregnancy.

As the use of birth alerts ends, the Department has created a Family Connections Co-ordinator position to support expectant families who are struggling or have multiple needs that place them at risk. This new role is part of the move to a more preventative child welfare system that places a stronger focus on supporting families as early as possible and in their respective communities.

Participation in Family Connections is voluntary, and some expectant parents may choose not to access services through this support. If there are needs after a child is born, the Department will continue to work with families to mitigate risk and ensure the safety and well-being of children.

The government is making additional investments in community-based child, youth and family-centred prevention and early intervention programs. The increase, which started in 2020-21, is expected to be $7.7 million by 2022-23.

Quotes:
“As a community and a society we need to get back to where we used to be in the sense of ‘it takes a village to raise a child.’ We, as the village, need to look out for each other, including expectant parents and especially those who may be struggling. When we love and care for one another, we lift each other up and we strengthen each other. There have been many hurts over the years, some of which we may never be able to get past. However, with the right supports in our communities and from our communities, there can be real and meaningful change.”
     - Trina Fraser, Executive Director, East Preston Day Care and Family Resource Centre

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Two Deaths, 59 New Cases of COVID-19, 58 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Two Deaths, 59 New Cases of COVID-19, 58 Recoveries
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 29, Nova Scotia is reporting two deaths related to COVID-19. A man in his 60s was a resident of the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash. Also, a man in is 70s in Western Zone has died; he was not a resident of a long-term care home.

“I am saddened to learn that two more Nova Scotians lost their lives because of this virus. I offer my condolences to those grieving,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We must stay vigilant as the holiday season approaches to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our province. We can do this by getting vaccinated, following public health measures and not socializing if you are sick.”

Today’s death connected to the long-term care home will be reflected on the COVID-19 dashboard when it is updated Tuesday.

Nova Scotia is also reporting 59 new cases of COVID-19 and 58 recoveries since the last update on November 26.

There are 38 cases in Northern Zone and 21 cases in Central Zone. There is a new cluster of cases in a localized community in Northern Zone and there is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and parts of northern Nova Scotia.

There are no new cases at East Cumberland Lodge. A total of 32 residents and 11 staff members at the home have tested positive, and four of the infected residents have died. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the two people who passed away,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Getting vaccinated will not only protect you but also your loved ones. I encourage all Nova Scotians to continue to work together and do your part in keeping each other safe by getting fully vaccinated and following public health measures.”

Over the past three days, nine schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures 

As of today, Nova Scotia has 171 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 13 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,686 tests on November 26; 2,476 tests on November 27; and 2,589 tests on November 28.

As of November 28, 1,632,289 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 789,898 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 18,800 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 2,331 positive COVID-19 cases and 16 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,145 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to December 12, 2021

Aujourd'hui 29 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale deux décès liés à la COVID-19. Un homme dans la soixantaine est décédé. Il était résident du foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash. De plus, un septuagénaire dans le secteur de l'ouest est décédé. Il n'était pas résident d'un foyer de soins de longue durée.

« Je suis attristé par le décès de deux autres Néo-Écossais en raison de ce virus. J'offre mes condoléances aux gens qui sont en deuil, souligne le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous devons rester vigilants à l'approche de la saison des fêtes afin de minimiser la propagation de la COVID-19 dans notre province. Faites-vous vacciner, respectez les mesures de santé publique et ne participez pas à des activités sociales si vous êtes malade. »

Le décès lié au foyer de soins de longue durée sera inclus au tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19 lorsqu'il sera mis à jour mardi.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 59 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 58 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 26 novembre.

Il y a 38 cas dans le secteur du nord et 21 cas dans le secteur du centre. Il y a une nouvelle grappe de cas dans une collectivité localisée du secteur du nord, et il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans certaines régions du nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Il n'y a aucun nouveau cas à signaler au foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge. Un total de 32 résidents et 11 membres du personnel du foyer de soins ont contracté la COVID-19, et quatre de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la Santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

« J'offre mes sincères condoléances et mes prières à la famille et aux proches des deux personnes qui sont décédées, affirme le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. En nous faisant vacciner, non seulement nous nous protégeons nous-mêmes, mais nous protégeons aussi nos proches. J'encourage tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à continuer de collaborer et de faire le nécessaire pour se protéger les uns les autres en se faisant vacciner et en respectant les mesures de santé publique. »

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé neuf écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 171 cas actifs de COVID-19. Treize personnes sont hospitalisées, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 686 tests le 26 novembre, 2 476 tests le 27 novembre et 2 589 tests le 28 novembre.

Au 28 novembre, 1 632 289 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 789 898 étaient une deuxième dose, et 18 800 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 331 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 16 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 145. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 12 décembre 2021.

"Health and Wellness / Education and Early Childhood Development / COVID - 19","Expansion du programme de trousses de tests de dépistage à faire à la maison pour les enfants, appel de bénévoles","COVID-19/ÉDUCATION ET DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA PETITE ENFANCE/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Expansion du programme de trousses de tests de dépistage à faire à la maison pour les enfants, appel de bénévoles
-------------------------------------------------------
Un plus grand nombre d'enfants de moins de 12 ans recevront gratuitement des trousses de tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 afin de détecter les cas de COVID-19 de façon plus précoce.

Environ 80 000 trousses de tests de dépistage rapides ont été distribuées aux enfants de la prématernelle à la 6e année dans le système des écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse plus tôt cette année scolaire dans le cadre du programme pilote intitulé « Des tests pour protéger les enfants ».

Au cours des prochaines semaines, les écoles privées, les garderies agréées et non agréées, les familles qui ont des enfants à la maison et les familles qui font l'enseignement à domicile pour des enfants de 3 à 11 ans pourront recevoir des trousses de tests de dépistage par prélèvement nasal dans le cadre de l'expansion du programme. Chaque trousse contiendra quatre tests de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 à faire à la maison ainsi que les instructions nécessaires.

« De nombreux parents nous ont dit qu'ils ont utilisé les tests rapides qui leur ont été fournis et qu'ils étaient reconnaissants pour la protection supplémentaire, en plus des mesures de santé publique de base qui sont en vigueur dans nos écoles, affirme Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. À l'approche de la saison de la grippe et du rhume, de plus en plus d'enfants se réveillent avec un écoulement nasal, et nous voulons faciliter l'accès aux tests pour les familles. »

Des bénévoles sont recherchés pour assembler les trousses du programme, qui offrira 260 000 tests rapides afin de rendre le dépistage plus accessible pour les familles et d'appuyer la détection précoce de la COVID-19.

Les écoles publiques distribueront des trousses supplémentaires de tests de dépistage par prélèvement nasal aux familles et aux enfants de la prématernelle à la 6e année qui souhaitent en recevoir. Chaque trousse contiendra deux tests de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 à faire à la maison ainsi que les instructions nécessaires.

La Santé publique veut qu'une famille utilise le test :
-- s'il est difficile pour la famille de se rendre à un centre de dépistage de la COVID-19 et que l'enfant a des symptômes de la COVID-19;
-- si l'enfant n'a qu'un symptôme bénin et qu'il n'a pas besoin d'un test PCR analysé en laboratoire;
-- si la famille est à l'aise de faire un prélèvement nasal peu profond sur l'enfant.

Les lieux où les gens pourront passer prendre les trousses seront annoncés la semaine prochaine et communiqués directement aux écoles privées, aux garderies agréées et non agréées, aux familles qui ont des enfants à la maison et aux familles qui font l'enseignement à domicile pour des enfants de 3 à 11 ans.

Les écoles offriront aux parents et tuteurs des renseignements supplémentaires sur l'expansion du programme la semaine prochaine.

« Les bénévoles, ces milliers de personnes enthousiastes, jouent un rôle essentiel en offrant l'accès aux tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 dans notre province. Nous avons besoin de leur aide encore une fois. Je suis tellement fière de leurs efforts et je sais que les gens vont se rassembler pour nous aider à surmonter ces quelques derniers obstacles. Afin de pouvoir offrir le programme de tests de dépistage rapide à un plus grand nombre de personnes en Nouvelle-Écosse, y compris les enfants à l'école, les voyageurs et les personnes qui vivent dans des régions où il y a transmission communautaire, nous avons besoin de bénévoles la semaine prochaine pour nous aider à assembler ses trousses de tests de dépistage de la COVID-19 à faire à la maison. »

Faits en bref
-- Les tests à faire à la maison peuvent être utilisés pour les enfants de 3 ans et plus qui ont des symptômes bénins de la COVID-19.
-- Le test de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 est moins précis qu'un test PCR, ce qui signifie que si le résultat du test de dépistage rapide est négatif, il faut le répéter 48 heures plus tard. Si le résultat du test est positif, il faut le confirmer au moyen d'un test PCR, pour lequel vous pouvez prendre rendez-vous au https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr ou en appelant au 811.

-------------------------------------------------------
More children under the age of 12 will receive free COVID-19 rapid tests kits in efforts to detect COVID-19 cases early.

About 80,000 rapid test kits were distributed to children in pre-primary to Grade 6 in Nova Scotia’s public school system earlier in the school year as part of the pilot program, called Test to Protect Kids.

Within the next few weeks, private schools, licensed and unlicensed day cares, families with children at home, and homeschooling families with children ages 3 to 11 will be offered nose swab testing kits as part of an expansion of the program. Each package will contain four take-home rapid COVID-19 tests with a set of instructions on how to complete the test.

“We’ve heard from many parents that they used the rapid tests provided to them and appreciated the added layer of protection on top of the core public health measures that exist in our schools,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “As we approach cold and flu season, more and more kids are waking up with the sniffles and we want to make it easier for families to access testing.”

Volunteers are needed to put together rapid test kits for the program, which will provide 260,000 rapid tests to make testing more accessible to families and support early detection of COVID-19.

Public schools will distribute additional nose swab testing kits to families with children in pre-primary to Grade 6 who want them. Each package will contain two take-home rapid COVID-19 tests with a set of instructions on how to complete the test.

Public health wants families to use the test:
-- if it is difficult for a family to get to a COVID-19 testing site and the child has symptoms of COVID-19
-- if a child only has one mild symptom and does not need a lab-based PCR test
-- as long as they are comfortable doing a shallow nose swab on their child.

Local pick-up spots will be announced next week and communicated directly to private schools, licensed and unlicensed day care, families with children at home, and homeschooling families with children ages 3 to 11.

Schools will provide parents and guardians more information about the expansion of the program next week.

Quotes:
“Volunteers, thousands of willing Nova Scotians, play an essential role in providing access to COVID-19 tests in our province, and we need their help again. I couldn’t be more proud of their efforts and know that people will rally around and get us through these last few hurdles in fine Nova Scotia (and holiday!) style. To expand the gift of the rapid testing program for Nova Scotians, including kids in schools, travellers and those in areas with community spread, we need volunteers next week to help with the assembly of these take-home COVID-19 tests.”
     - Dr. Lisa Barrett, Clinician Scientist and Viral Immunologist, Nova Scotia Health Authority

Quick Facts:
-- at-home tests can be used on people ages 3 and older with mild COVID-19 symptoms
-- rapid COVID-19 tests are less accurate than a PCR test, which means if the rapid test is negative, it needs to be repeated in 48 hours; if the rapid test is positive, it must be confirmed with a PCR COVID-19 test, which can be booked at https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en or by calling 811

Le gouvernement provincial reconduit l'état d'urgence afin de protéger la santé et la sécurité des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et d'assurer la continuité des mesures de sécurité et d'autres mesures importantes. L'ordonnance prendra effet à midi le dimanche 28 novembre et sera en vigueur jusqu'à midi le dimanche 12 décembre, à moins que le gouvernement n'y mette fin ou la prolonge.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Subventions pour aider les aînés à vivre dans leur maison plus longtemps","AÎNÉS ET SOINS DE LONGUE DURÉE--Subventions pour aider les aînés à vivre dans leur maison plus longtemps
----------------------------------------------------------------
La Province s'acquitte de son engagement à aider les personnes âgées à vivre dans leur maison plus longtemps en investissant jusqu'à 32 millions de dollars par année dans l'Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés.

L'allocation offre un financement pouvant s'élever à 500 $ aux personnes admissibles de 65 ans et plus qui ont besoin d'aide pour certaines choses, par exemple le déneigement, des petites rénovations, l'entretien du gazon, la livraison d'épicerie et autres.

« Nous savons que de nombreux aînés en Nouvelle-Écosse font face à certains défis à la maison, et souvent il suffit d'un coup de main avec des petits travaux ici et là, affirme Barbara Adams, ministre des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée. Cet investissement permettra aux personnes âgées d'entretenir leur maison et de pouvoir y demeurer avec la dignité qu'elles méritent. »

Pour être admissibles, les personnes âgées doivent vivre de façon indépendante dans une maison dont elles sont propriétaires ou locataires, et leur revenu net annuel doit être de 37 500 $ ou moins. 

Les demandes seront acceptées à compter du 1er décembre et peuvent être soumises en ligne, par la poste ou par télécopieur. Le formulaire de demande sera disponible en ligne. La version papier du formulaire sera disponible dans les centres Accès Nouvelle-Écosse et dans les bureaux des députés. Vous pouvez également composer le 1-800-670-4357 pour demander qu'on vous envoie un formulaire par la poste. La date limite de présentation des demandes est le 31 mai 2022, et les fonds peuvent être utilisés jusqu'au 30 novembre 2022. 

Le gouvernement offre également des programmes pour aider les personnes âgées à payer les frais de chauffage et les impôts fonciers.

Faits en bref 
-- Une seule subvention maximale de 500 $ sera offerte à chaque ménage admissible par année. 
-- Les personnes âgées devront présenter une demande chaque année. 
-- Les personnes de 65 ans ou plus qui sont propriétaires ou locataires de leur logement sont admissibles à la subvention. Le logement ou le bail doit être à leur nom. 
-- Les dépenses admissibles sont celles qui rendent le logement plus sécuritaire et plus confortable, par exemple des réparations à domicile, l'entretien du gazon, le déneigement, le nettoyage de la maison et la livraison d'épicerie et de médicaments. 
-- Les demandes peuvent être faites pour des dépenses déjà engagées ou prévues pour des services et travaux à domicile, et il faut conserver les reçus.  
-- L'établissement d'une Allocation pour services à domicile chez les aînés est un objectif de la lettre de mandat de la ministre.

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Grant Will Help Seniors Stay in Their Homes Longer","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Grant Will Help Seniors Stay in Their Homes Longer
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is following through on its commitment to help seniors stay in their homes longer by investing up to $32 million each year in the Seniors Care Grant.

The grant provides up to $500 in funding for eligible Nova Scotians aged 65 years and older who need help around their homes. Covered expenses include snow removal, small household repairs, lawn care, grocery delivery and other needs.

“We know many Nova Scotia seniors face challenges staying in their homes, and often they just need a helping hand with small jobs here and there,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “This investment makes it easier for older Nova Scotians to maintain and afford their homes with the dignity they deserve.”

To qualify, older Nova Scotians must live independently in a home they own or rent and have an annual household income of $37,500 or less. 

Applications open on December 1 and can be submitted online, by mail or by fax. The application will be available online at https://beta.novascotia.ca/apply-help-household-costs-seniors-care-grant . Print applications will be available at Access Nova Scotia Centres and MLA offices, or by calling 1-800-670-4357 to request that one be mailed. The deadline for applications is May 31, 2022, and funds can be used through November 30, 2022.

The government also offers support programs to help seniors with the costs of heating and property tax.

Quick Facts: 
-- only one grant of up to $500 will be available to each eligible household each year; seniors need to apply for the grant once per year 
-- people 65 and older who rent or own their home are eligible to receive the grant; the property or lease must be in their name 
-- eligible expenses are those intended to make the home safer and more comfortable, and may include services like home repairs, lawncare, snow removal, house cleaning services, and grocery and medication deliveries 
-- applicants can apply for incurred and expected expenses for household services and work, and need to keep receipts 
-- establishing a Seniors Care Grant for help with household services is in the Minister’s mandate letter

"Develop Nova Scotia","Opening Celebration of New Queen’s Marque Public Space","DEVELOP NOVA SCOTIA--Opening Celebration of New Queen’s Marque Public Space
----------------------------------------------------------------
Almost 9,300 square metres (100,000 sq. ft.) of accessible and engaging public space is now open as part of the Queen’s Marque district on the Halifax waterfront.

Representatives from The Armour Group, the Province of Nova Scotia, Halifax Regional Municipality and Develop Nova Scotia joined community members to celebrate the opening of the new public space today, November 26.

A central courtyard called Rise Again Square, boat-yard inspired passageways, new seating, greenery and engaging public art aim to draw visitors through a modern context. 

“The Halifax waterfront is a focal point of this city and a beloved spot for locals and tourists alike,” said Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Steve Craig, on behalf of Economic Development Minister Susan Corkum-Greek. “This wonderful new district, with its strong commitment to local, truly showcases how culture and commerce can come together to grow the economy and enhance our communities.”  

Located at the edge of the Halifax Harbour and bound by Prince, Lower Water and George streets, the Queen’s Marque district was developed and led by The Armour Group, in partnership with Develop Nova Scotia, which will lead the programming for the area and operate the public space.

In addition to the new public space, the Queen’s Marque district includes retail, dining, office and residential space, as well as hotel and parking, representing an almost $200 million private investment in the waterfront. Focusing on Nova Scotian and regional elements of design, architecture and materials, the project supported local businesses, suppliers and others.

Queen’s Marque is also home to a significant art collection, featuring the creations of celebrated artists from Nova Scotia and around the world, including the public art piece Sail by Italian sculptor Eduardo Tresoldi, known for his monumental sculptures of wire mesh. Created through investment by The Armour Group, it will be owned and maintained by Develop Nova Scotia as part of its public art collection. Another highlight is The Sirens Calling art piece by John Greer. A Governor General’s Award recipient, the piece is an original commissioned sculptural work featuring four figures of Greek mythology. 

Other highlights include:
-- three new public wharves, including the North Wharf, which extends out into the harbour, providing more than 106 metres (350 linear feet) of new publicly accessible dock to complement Develop Nova Scotia’s growing marina program
-- the Rise Again structure, which is being finalized; this set of steps will provide the public with an area for relaxation, to enjoy events and programming, and view the harbour
-- the new harbour stairs, known as Queen’s Landing, which allow for comfortable seating and a chance to connect to the water.

Quotes:
“Through partnerships like the one with The Armour Group, we can create new places for people to live, do business, invest and participate in social life. This visionary development is a celebration of Nova Scotia and it contributes to the magnetism of the waterfront, and Nova Scotia. It attracts investment, and it enhances quality of life for residents. We applaud The Armour Group for their commitment to building something extraordinary for Halifax and we look forward to Nova Scotians and visitors experiencing Queen’s Marque. We are proud that the best part of the property, at the water’s edge, is a place for everyone.” 
     - Jennifer Angel, President and CEO, Develop Nova Scotia

“Queen’s Marque is a remarkable addition to Halifax’s beloved waterfront, with new public spaces that will allow more people to connect with each other, with the city and with the harbour that unites our communities. This is a significant accomplishment for all involved.”
     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality 

Quick Facts: 
-- the Queen’s Marque public space is more than double what was previously in that area – from 3,827 square metres (41,200 sq. ft.) to approximately 9,270 square metres (99,800 sq. ft.), an increase of 41 per cent 
-- known historically as Queen's Landing, the area references the province's connection to shipping and the marine industry 
-- to celebrate the opening of the public space, there will be entertainment and an ice carver on site on the afternoon of November 26
-- family friendly activities will continue on Saturday, November 27, from 12 to 4:30 p.m. as part of the four-week outdoor Evergreen Festival

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Vaccins contre la COVID-19 pour les enfants de 5 à 11 ans","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Vaccins contre la COVID-19 pour les enfants de 5 à 11 ans
--------------------------------------------------------
Les parents et tuteurs d'enfants de 5 à 11 ans peuvent maintenant prendre rendez-vous pour le vaccin contre la COVID-19 de leur enfant.

« La pandémie a été difficile pour les familles et les jeunes enfants. La fermeture des écoles et l'isolement social, loin des amis, des membres de la famille et des activités qu'ils aiment faire, ont été pénibles, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. J'encourage fortement les familles à considérer la vaccination pour leurs enfants afin de les protéger et de protéger ceux et celles qui les entourent contre le virus. »

Les enfants recevront le vaccin pédiatrique de Pfizer contre la COVID-19, qui est actuellement le seul vaccin approuvé au Canada pour ce groupe d'âge. La composition de ce vaccin est très semblable à celle du vaccin de Pfizer pour les adolescents et les adultes.

Les enfants devront recevoir deux doses du vaccin à au moins huit semaines d'intervalle, et ils seront considérés comme étant entièrement vaccinés 14 jours après la deuxième dose. Les enfants qui recevront les deux doses avant d'avoir 12 ans recevront deux doses du vaccin pédiatrique.

Les enfants qui reçoivent leur première dose du vaccin pédiatrique à l'âge de 11 ans et qui auront 12 ans au moment de recevoir leur deuxième dose recevront le vaccin pour adolescents et adultes comme deuxième dose. Les doses seront tout de même administrées à au moins huit semaines d'intervalle.

Il n'y a aucun changement à la dose ou à l'intervalle entre les doses pour jeunes de 12 ans et plus. L'intervalle autorisé pour les vaccins de Pfizer et de Moderna est de 21 jours et 28 jours respectivement, mais le Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation (CCNI) recommande un intervalle de huit semaines entre la première dose et la deuxième dose pour assurer une protection optimale. Les études ont démontré qu'un intervalle plus long entraîne une protection plus durable.

Sauf sur l'avis d'un fournisseur de soins de santé, les enfants ne doivent pas recevoir d'autres vaccins réguliers, comme le vaccin contre la grippe, en même temps que le vaccin contre la COVID-19. Les enfants devront recevoir tout autre vaccin 14 jours avant ou après le vaccin contre la COVID-19. Si les familles doivent choisir entre le vaccin contre la COVID-19 et un autre vaccin, le vaccin contre la COVID-19 devrait être prioritaire. Toute personne de 12 ans ou plus n'a pas à attendre 14 jours pour recevoir un autre vaccin.

« La meilleure façon de protéger les enfants contre le virus est de les vacciner et de respecter les mesures de santé publique. Si votre enfant est admissible, prenez rendez-vous dès maintenant, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Même si le virus a tendance à causer une maladie légère chez les enfants en général, ne prenez pas de risque avec leur santé et la santé des autres. Ce virus se propage très rapidement chez les enfants, et la vaccination de ce groupe d'âge nous aidera vraiment à prévenir la transmission dans notre province. »

On encourage les familles à prendre rendez-vous pour leurs enfants dès que possible. Il faudra un minimum de dix semaines pour qu'un enfant de cet âge soit entièrement vacciné (intervalle de huit semaines entre les deux doses, plus deux semaines après la deuxième dose). En Nouvelle-Écosse, l'expérience avec les vaccins contre la COVID-19 chez la population plus âgée a démontré que même une seule dose offre une certaine protection après deux semaines. Il n'y a aucune raison de croire que le même effet ne se produirait pas chez les enfants plus jeunes.

La Province aura suffisamment de vaccins pédiatriques contre la COVID-19 et suffisamment de rendez-vous pour offrir une première dose à tous les enfants de 5 à 11 ans d'ici la fin de l'année 2021.

Les familles peuvent prendre rendez-vous en ligne au https://novascotia.ca/vaccination/fr. La prise de rendez-vous par téléphone est seulement recommandée s'il est impossible de le faire en ligne. Les personnes qui prennent rendez-vous par téléphone peuvent s'attendre à un volume élevé d'appels.

On rappelle également aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de prendre rendez-vous pour leur dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 s'ils sont admissibles. Il y a amplement de rendez-vous disponibles dans les cliniques à l'échelle de la province. Il faut prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir une dose de rappel. Les personnes qui se présentent à une clinique sans avoir pris rendez-vous ne seront pas admises.

Faits en bref
-- Il y a environ 65 000 enfants admissibles de 5 à 11 ans en Nouvelle-Écosse.
-- La Province a adopté les recommandations du CCNI pour le vaccin pédiatrique de Pfizer contre la COVID-19 pour ce groupe d'âge.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five to 11","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five to 11
-------------------------------------------------------
Parents and guardians of children aged five to 11 can now book their child’s COVID-19 vaccine appointment.

“The pandemic has been challenging for families and young children. School closures and social isolation from friends, families and activities they enjoy has been difficult,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I strongly encourage families to consider vaccination for their children to protect them and everyone around them from the virus.”

Children will receive Pfizer’s pediatric COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently the only one approved in Canada for this age group. The formulation of this vaccine is very similar to the adolescent/adult Pfizer vaccine.

Children will need two doses of vaccine at least eight weeks apart and will be considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose. Children who receive both doses before they turn 12 will receive two doses of the pediatric vaccine.

Children who receive their first dose of pediatric vaccine at age 11 and turn 12 before receiving their second dose will receive the adolescent/adult vaccine for their second dose. Doses will still be provided at least eight weeks apart.

There is no change to the dosage or time between doses for youth 12 and older. The authorized interval for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is 21 and 28 days, respectively, however, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends everyone schedule their primary series eight weeks apart for optimal protection. Evidence has shown a longer interval results in longer-lasting protection.

Unless directed by a healthcare provider, children won’t be able to get other routine vaccinations, such as the flu vaccine, and the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. Children will need to receive other vaccines 14 days before or after the COVID-19 vaccine. If families have to choose between vaccinations, the COVID-19 vaccine should be the priority. Anyone 12 and older does not have to wait 14 days between vaccinations.

“The key to safeguarding children against the virus is to get vaccinated and follow public health measures. If your child is eligible, make their appointment now,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “While this virus tends to lead to mild illness in children most of the time, don’t take a chance with their health or the health of others around them. This virus spreads like wildfire in children and getting this age group vaccinated will really help to prevent spread in our province.”

Families are encouraged to schedule an appointment for their child as soon as they are able. It takes a minimum of 10 weeks for a child in this age group to be fully vaccinated (the eight-week interval between doses, plus two weeks after the second dose). Nova Scotia’s experience with COVID-19 vaccines among older populations has shown that a single dose provides some protection approximately two weeks later, and there is no reason to believe that this would not be the case in younger children.

The Province will have enough pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and appointments to provide every child aged five to 11 their first dose by the end of 2021.

Families should book their child’s appointment online at https://novascotia.ca/vaccination . Booking by phone is only recommended if online booking is not an option. People who book by phone should expect high call volumes.

Nova Scotians are also reminded to book a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose if they are eligible. There are plenty of available appointments in clinics across the province. People must schedule a booster dose appointment – those who show up to a clinic without an appointment will be turned away.

Quick Facts:
-- there are about 65,000 eligible children aged five to 11 in Nova Scotia
-- the Province has adopted NACI’s recommendations on Pfizer’s pediatric COVID-19 vaccine for this age group

"COVID - 19 / Office of Addictions and Mental Health / Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Emergency Support Provided to 56 Non-Profit Recreation Facilities","COVID-19/COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE/ADDICTIONS/MENTAL HEALTH--Emergency Support Provided to 56 Non-Profit Recreation Facilities
---------------------------------------------------------
The Province has approved emergency funding for 56 recreation facilities owned and operated by non-profit organizations to help them adapt to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.

“Recreation facilities are the cornerstone of healthy, strong and thriving communities, so it was important that they received support to work through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage Minister Pat Dunn. “Nova Scotians depend on these facilities to get active and connect with their community.”

Due to COVID-19 public health restrictions, many recreation facilities were closed for various lengths of time, resulting in significant revenue loss. They faced lost rentals and cancelled events, increased cleaning and maintenance expenses, staff layoffs and limited ability to fundraise.

Grant recipients include the Ivor MacDonald Memorial Arena in Thorburn, Pictou County, which received $40,000 to help the facility cover operational expenses and ensure that the arena could continue to operate.

The $1 million emergency support fund was announced in July as a one-time, application-based program based on proven need. 

Quotes:
“Recreational facilities often serve as the heart of our communities. They not only provide us opportunities to be active and improve our mental health, but they are where we go to connect with each other. It is important that we support their operations so that they can continue to deliver these services to Nova Scotians.”
     - Brian Comer, Minister of Addictions and Mental Health

“The COVID-19 pandemic has been hard on everyone, especially our rural communities and community facilities. The Recreation Facilities Association of Nova Scotia is very pleased that the Province listened to our concerns and was able to provide this one-time funding program which will mean the difference between reopening, staying open and closing for good, for many of our facilities.”
     - Jennie Greencorn, Executive Director, Recreation Facilities Association of Nova Scotia

“The Ivor MacDonald Memorial Arena is very grateful to receive this funding. As a not-for-profit organization, the last 18 months have been difficult and challenging. COVID-19 changed the way we had to operate and resulted in loss of revenue and additional expenses. This money will help offset some of those losses and allow us to continue to serve the communities of Pictou East.”
     - Randy Palmer, Director, Ivor MacDonald Memorial Arena

Quick Facts:
-- Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage contributed $800,000 to the emergency fund while the Office of Addictions and Mental Health contributed $200,000
-- facilities that were eligible for this funding included arenas, rinks, pools, curling clubs, multiplexes, community recreation centres and other multi-purpose facilities

"Fisheries and Aquaculture / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Safety Top of Mind as Lobster Season Starts in Southwestern Nova Scotia","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION/FISHERIES/AQUACULTURE--Safety Top of Mind as Lobster Season Starts in Southwestern Nova Scotia
-------------------------------------------------------
Lobster fishing crews in southwestern Nova Scotia are reminded to make safety a priority and follow rules and guidelines as they begin their fishing season.

Dumping Day, traditionally the last Monday in November, marks the official start of the fishing season in lobster fishing areas 33 and 34 along the southern and western shores of the province.

“Safety must be top of mind for the hundreds of fishers who set out on the water on Dumping Day to set their traps,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “While very important for Nova Scotia’s economy, lobster fishing is dangerous work. A successful season also means every crew comes home safely at the end of their workday. I strongly urge all fishers to take the time and necessary steps to keep themselves safe, to be sure they get home to their loved ones.”

Before heading out every morning, it is important for crews to:
-- monitor the weather
-- assess their boats
-- examine their safety gear and check on others on board
-- stay on the lookout for potential working hazards
-- wear their personal flotation devices
-- stay prepared for emergencies.

Quotes:
“Fishing is difficult and sometimes dangerous work. I urge everyone – captains and crews – to take a moment to think about safety on board the boat. Locate your safety gear, run through your safety drills and be ready for the unexpected. Do it for yourself, your crewmates and your family. We want everyone to return home safely.”
     - Steve Craig, Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture

“I’m proud of the work the fishing industry has put in over the last six years. We've seen a shift of not just knowing about safety but caring about it, with more captains taking steps to improve safety on their vessels, attend wharf-side safety demonstrations, and focus on safety training for their crew. While fishing remains a dangerous job, these are all positive signs of a changing safety culture.”
     - Stuart MacLean, CEO, WCB Nova Scotia

”Ensuring that everyone heading out on the water this season remains healthy and safe is our top priority. Fish Safe NS strongly encourages all fish harvesters and those who work near the water to always wear their PFD so you can come home safely at the end of each day. Through our combined efforts the fishing industry has made incredible strides towards a stronger safety culture, and with that, we ask that all fishing vessel owners ensure their safety equipment is inspected and crews are trained on how to use it. We wish all captains and crews in LFA 33 and 34 a very safe season.”
     - Matthew Duffy, Executive Director, Fish Safe NS

Quick Facts:
-- occupational health and safety laws require fishing crews to wear a life jacket or other personal flotation device (PFD)
-- since 2012, Fish Safe NS and its partners have completed 225 man-overboard drills across the province
-- this fall, Labour, Skills and Immigration staff attended 51 of 72 Safety Dock Talks hosted in southwestern Nova Scotia by occupational health and safety officers and Fish Safe NS
-- Labour, Skills and Immigration, WCB Nova Scotia, Fish Safe NS and the Nova Scotia Fisheries Sector Council partnered to deliver a fishing safety awareness campaign to remind captains, crew and families of the importance of wearing a PFD while on or near the water

"Fisheries and Aquaculture / Labour, Skills and Immigration","Priorité à la sécurité en ce début de saison de la pêche au homard dans le sud-ouest de la Nouvelle-Écosse","TRAVAIL, COMPÉTENCES ET IMMIGRATION/PÊCHES ET AQUACULTURE--Priorité à la sécurité en ce début de saison de la pêche au homard dans le sud-ouest de la Nouvelle-Écosse
--------------------------------------------------------
On rappelle aux équipes de pêche au homard dans le sud-ouest de la province que leur sécurité doit être leur priorité et qu’elles doivent suivre les règles et les lignes directrices en ce début de saison de la pêche.

La tradition veut que le dernier lundi de novembre marque le début officiel de la saison de pêche au homard pour les zones de pêche 33 et 34, le long des côtes sud et ouest de la province.

« La sécurité doit être la priorité pour les centaines de pêcheurs qui mettront leurs casiers à la mer ce lundi, a déclaré Jill Balser, ministre du Travail, des Compétences et de l’Immigration. Bien que la pêche au homard soit importante pour l’économie de la Nouvelle-Écosse, elle est aussi un travail dangereux. Une saison réussie, c’est aussi des équipages qui reviennent à la maison sains et saufs à la fin de leur journée de travail. J’insiste vivement auprès de tous les pêcheurs pour qu’ils prennent le temps et les mesures nécessaires pour assurer leur sécurité, et pour qu’ils reviennent chez eux auprès de leurs proches. »

Avant de prendre la mer chaque matin, les membres d’équipage doivent :
-- surveiller les prévisions météorologiques;
-- examiner leur bateau;
-- examiner leur équipement de sécurité;
-- se tenir aux aguets pour tout danger possible pendant leur travail; 
-- porter leur vêtement de flottaison individuel;
-- être prêts à réagir en cas d'urgence.

« La pêche, c’est un travail difficile et parfois dangereux. Je recommande fortement – aux capitaines et aux équipages – de prendre un moment pour penser à leur sécurité à bord du navire. Repérez votre équipement de sécurité, repassez vos exercices de sécurité et soyez prêts pour les imprévus. Faites-le pour vous, pour vos collègues et pour votre famille. Nous voulons que chacun revienne à la maison sain et sauf. »
     – Steve Craig, sous-ministre des Pêches et de l'Aquaculture

« Je suis fier du travail accompli par l’industrie de la pêche ces six dernières années. Nous avons observé un changement d’attitude, où on n’est pas seulement conscient de la sécurité, mais où on s’en soucie réellement, et ce, chez plus de capitaines qui prennent des mesures pour améliorer la sécurité à bord de leur navire, qui participent à des démonstrations de sécurité à quai, et qui accordent de l’importance à la formation en mesures de sécurité pour leur équipage. Même si la pêche demeure un travail dangereux, ce sont là de bons signes qui témoignent d’un changement de culture en matière de sécurité. »
     – Stuart MacLean, président et directeur général, Commission des accidents du travail de la Nouvelle-Écosse

« Notre grande priorité, c’est de veiller à ce que toutes les personnes qui partent en mer pour la pêche cette saison puissent revenir saines et sauves. Fish Safe NS encourage fortement tous les pêcheurs et toutes les personnes qui travaillent près de l’eau à toujours porter leur vêtement de flottaison individuel pour pouvoir revenir à la maison chaque jour en toute sécurité. Grâce à nos efforts combinés, l’industrie de la pêche a fait des progrès incroyables vers une culture de la sécurité mieux ancrée et, pour cette raison, nous demandons à tous les propriétaires de navires de pêche de veiller à ce que leur équipement de sécurité soit inspecté et à ce que leur équipage ait la formation nécessaire pour l’utiliser. Nous souhaitons une saison de pêche sûre à tous les capitaines et à tous les équipages dans les zones de pêche au homard 33 et 34. » 
     – Matthew Duffy, directeur général, Fish Safe NS

Fait en bref
-- Les lois sur la santé et la sécurité au travail exigent que les membres des équipages de pêche portent un gilet de sauvetage ou un autre vêtement de flottaison individuel. 
-- Depuis 2012, Fish Safe NS et ses partenaires ont réalisé 225 exercices de récupération d’un homme à la mer partout dans la province. 
-- Cet automne, le personnel de Travail, Compétences et Immigration a assisté à 51 des 72 présentations sur la sécurité faites à quai dans le sud-ouest de la Nouvelle-Écosse et organisées par des agents de santé et de sécurité au travail et Fish Safe NS.
-- Travail, Compétences et Immigration, la Commission des accidents du travail de la N.-É., Fish Safe NS et le Nova Scotia Fisheries Sector Council ont uni leurs efforts pour présenter une campagne de sensibilisation sur la sécurité entourant la pêche pour rappeler aux capitaines, aux membres d’équipages et aux familles combien il est important de porter un vêtement de flottaison individuel quand ils sont sur l’eau ou près de l’eau.

---------------------------------------------------------
Tous les élèves méritent du soutien qui répond à leurs besoins et favorise leur bien-être. La Province continue d’améliorer ce soutien en embauchant plus d’employés et de spécialistes pour les classes et en donnant suite aux recommandations émanant de l’examen évolutif de l’intégration en éducation.

Durant la présente année scolaire, la Province finance 277 nouveaux postes en éducation inclusive pour mieux répondre aux besoins variés des élèves en matière d’apprentissage. Les nouveaux postes sont pour des aides-enseignants et des conseillers scolaires, des spécialistes en soutien aux élèves atteints d’autisme et de troubles du comportement, des psychologues et des orthophonistes scolaires, et des agents de soutien et d’inclusion scolaires afro-néo-écossais et mi’kmaq. 

« Notre objectif est de veiller à ce que tous les élèves aient la possibilité de réussir, a indiqué la ministre de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, Becky Druhan. Les dispositifs de soutien en éducation inclusive découlent du mandat contenu dans le rapport Les élèves en premier. Il s’agit de bâtir un solide réseau autour des élèves, des enseignants et des familles pour que chacun puisse réaliser son plein potentiel. »

Le système d’éducation adapte ses plans de travail en éducation inclusive en fonction des conclusions de l’équipe de recherche qui mène une évaluation sur trois ans de la politique sur l’éducation inclusive de la Nouvelle-Écosse. L’équipe a terminé son rapport intérimaire de la première année.

Les chercheurs, dirigés par Jess Whitley et Andy Hargreaves de l’Université d’Ottawa, ont constaté que les principes de la politique bénéficient d’un vaste soutien. Ils ont suggéré une meilleure collaboration au sein des écoles et des communications plus claires à l’échelle du système des écoles en matière d’éducation inclusive.

La politique sur l'éducation inclusive de la Nouvelle-Écosse a été créée en réponse à une recommandation de la Commission sur l'intégration dans l’éducation et elle est appliquée depuis septembre 2020.

---------------------------------------------------------
All students deserve support that meets their needs and nurtures their well-being. The Province continues to enhance that support by hiring more staff and specialists for classrooms and acting on recommendations from the ongoing review of inclusive education.

In this school year, the Province is funding an additional 277 inclusive education positions to better support students’ diverse learning needs. These positions include teacher assistants and school counsellors; autism and behavioural support specialists; school psychologists and speech language pathologists; and African Nova Scotian and Mi’kmaq student support workers.

“We are focused on ensuring every student has the opportunity to succeed,” said Education and Early Childhood Development Minister Becky Druhan. “Inclusive education supports the mandate of the Students First report. This is about building a strong network around students, teachers and families so that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.”

The education system is adapting its inclusive education work plans based on the findings of the research team who are conducting a three-year review of Nova Scotia’s Inclusive Education Policy. The team has completed its Year 1 interim report.

The researchers, led by Jess Whitley and Andy Hargreaves at the University of Ottawa, have found widespread support for the policy. They have suggested better collaboration inside schools and clearer communications across the school system related to inclusive education.

Nova Scotia’s Inclusive Education Policy was created in response to a recommendation from the Commission on Inclusive Education and has been in place since September 2020.

Quotes:
“We are immensely appreciative of the deep engagement of families, school staff, educational leaders, community associations and unions in this evaluation. Their voices are key to successful implementation of the policy. A passion for inclusive education that can ensure the success of all students in Nova Scotia has emerged in every conversation we’ve had. We look forward to further collaboration with Nova Scotians as we continue to gather evidence to inform the successful realization of inclusive education in the Province of Nova Scotia.”
     - joint statement from Jess Whitley and Andy Hargreaves, lead evaluators of the inclusive education review team

“Having specialized supports makes a big difference in our school. It’s great to have our SchoolsPlus team, social workers, guidance councillors, and other student support staff available for day-to-day consultation and as partners to help support our students’ learning and well-being. It needs to be a team effort.”
     - Stephen Corkum, Principal, Millwood High School

“Addressing the needs of students with disabilities continues to remain a top priority for Inclusion Nova Scotia. We are pleased that the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development has been following the recommendations of the Students First report to add new staff positions to support students with disabilities. There are additional improvements needed which we expect to be revealed as a result of the current review, and we look forward to our continued collaboration with the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development to ensure all students, regardless of ability, are given the opportunity to reach their full potential.”
     - Patricia Neves, Executive Director, Inclusion NS

“We have come a long way in terms of adding inclusive education support professionals to the education system. Now, it is time to integrate these professionals into the classroom so that students, teachers and families can fully realize the benefits. We are collaborating with school sites to support the diverse needs of students and seamlessly implement wraparound supports.”

Les artistes de la Nouvelle-Écosse font la promotion de l'expression et de la créativité, offrent de nouvelles perspectives et contribuent à apporter des changements positifs à notre culture. Les Prix pour la création en Nouvelle-Écosse célèbrent quelques-uns de ces artistes chaque année et soulignent leurs excellentes réalisations artistiques.

« Je suis ravi des lauréats cette année et je les félicite sincèrement, affirme Pat Dunn, ministre des Communautés, de la Culture, du Tourisme et du Patrimoine. Les arts jouent un rôle essentiel dans la culture et le patrimoine riches de la Nouvelle-Écosse, et constituent un élément important de la croissance économique diverse de la province. Célébrer la vaste gamme d'artistes que nous sommes chanceux d'avoir dans notre province est une façon de montrer notre appui. »

-------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s artists promote expression and creativity, offer new perspectives and help create positive change in our culture. The Creative Nova Scotia Awards celebrate a select few of these artists each year, highlighting their excellence in artistic achievement.

“I am thrilled by this year’s award recipients and wish to offer them all a sincere congratulations,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “The arts play a critical role in Nova Scotia’s rich culture and heritage and are a major component of diverse economic growth in the province. Championing the wide range of artists that we are lucky to have in our province is one way we can show our support.”

The Portia White Prize was awarded to Catherine Anne Martin, an independent, international award-winning film producer and director, writer, facilitator, communications consultant, community activist, teacher, drummer and filmmaker. They are a member of the Millbrook Mi’kmaw Community in Truro and received $18,000 as part of the award. An additional $7,000 was awarded to their chosen protégé, Natalie Gloade. She is the daughter of the late Mi’kmaq activist/ warrior Madeline (Nora) Bernard. Ms. Gloade has created a space for art and healing at her mother’s home to carry on Nora’s inspiration and spirit in her community. 

This year 12 artists and one organization are being honoured through seven major awards, including the inaugural Black Artist Recognition Award. The $5,000 prize was awarded to Shauntay Grant, a poet, playwright, author and multimedia artist from Halifax.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","New Mainland Moose Recovery Plan","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--New Mainland Moose Recovery Plan
----------------------------------------------------------------
A new recovery plan will help the long-term recovery of Nova Scotia’s endangered mainland moose population.

A team including wildlife biologists, habitat specialists and veterinary experts from government and academia was appointed in 2019 to create a plan based on the best available scientific knowledge and expertise. It developed a recovery plan to address threats, protect and enhance habitat, improve connectivity and ensure regular monitoring and assessment of population health.

“Moose are an important part of our province’s natural and cultural identity. We now have an evidence-based recovery plan, which sets priorities and timelines for further action to help save this important species,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “I thank the recovery planning team for its work and commit to working with our partners to implement the plan, with some actions already started.”

The Department of Natural Resources and Renewables will conduct a baseline survey of the current moose population size and distribution this winter. The results will generate new data and help guide the recovery plan’s ongoing implementation.

The Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaw Chiefs will also be consulted on using traditional knowledge to implement the recovery plan.

The recovery plan also identifies areas to be considered for designation as core habitat, which are specific areas essential for recovery and long-term survival. About two-thirds of core habitat is located on Crown land or protected areas.

The Province will continue to require special management practices for any forestry harvest within mainland moose habitat on Crown land. Special management practices ensure habitat for shelter and transit corridors remain in place.

Ecological forestry supports the recovery needs of species at risk. The Department will ensure that the ongoing implementation of these practices on Crown land are aligned with the moose recovery plan.

Quotes:
“The recovery team has delivered a plan with the goal of returning populations of these amazing animals to more sustainable levels. There are several factors impacting the mainland moose population, and the recovery plan outlines what we can do to address those factors.”
     - Mark McGarrigle, Species-at-Risk Biologist and Mainland Moose Recovery Team Lead, Department of Natural Resources and Renewables 

“In developing the recovery strategy, the team brought a wealth of different expertise and carefully considered all ecological needs of mainland moose. The final prescriptions in the strategy are rigorous and will be effective. This strategy is the right tool to recover mainland moose populations in Nova Scotia.” 
     - Joseph Nocera, University of New Brunswick Faculty of Forestry and Environmental Management, and Mainland Moose Recovery Team Member

Quick Facts:
-- the mainland moose was added to the endangered species list in 2003
-- factors affecting the mainland moose population include poaching, disease, road collisions, climate change, habitat and habitat connectivity loss
-- there are about 700 mainland moose in Nova Scotia
-- recovery plans are meant to be reviewed every five years and updated every 10 years

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Un décès, 22 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 24 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Un décès, 22 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 24 cas résolus 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 25 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Un septuagénaire est décédé dans le secteur du centre.

« Je suis attristé d'apprendre le décès d'un autre Néo-Écossais aujourd'hui, particulièrement à l'approche d'une période de l'année qui est censée être remplie de joie, déclare le premier ministre Tim Houston. J'offre mes plus sincères condoléances à la famille et aux amis qui sont en deuil. Faites-vous vacciner si ce n'est pas encore fait, et faites le nécessaire pour qu'aucune autre personne dans cette province ne pleure la perte d'un être cher en raison de la COVID-19. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également 22 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 24 rétablissements.

Il y a 16 cas dans le secteur du centre, 5 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Aucun nouveau cas n'est signalé aujourd'hui au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge de Pugwash. Un total de 32 résidents et 11 membres du personnel du foyer de soins ont contracté la COVID-19, et trois de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

« Aujourd'hui nous pleurons la perte d'un autre Néo-Écossais en raison de ce virus. J'offre mes prières et mes condoléances à la famille et aux proches de l'homme qui est décédé, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Chacune de ces pertes est un rappel que la COVID-19 demeure un danger réel, et ça me brise le coeur de savoir qu'une autre famille est en deuil en raison de la perte d'un être cher avant son temps. »

Le 24 novembre, on a avisé huit écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 169 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix-sept personnes sont hospitalisées, dont cinq aux soins intensifs.

Le 24 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 778 tests.

Au 24 novembre, 1 625 969 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 788 242 étaient une deuxième dose, et 15 021 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 245 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 14 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 062. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 25, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 70s in Central Zone has died.

“I am saddened to hear about the loss of another Nova Scotian today, especially as we are nearing what is supposed to be a joyful time of year,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I offer my deepest sympathies to the family and friends grieving. Please get fully vaccinated if you haven’t done so yet and do everything you can to help make sure not one more Nova Scotian has to mourn the loss of a loved one as a result of COVID-19.”

Nova Scotia is also reporting 22 new cases of COVID-19 and 24 recoveries.

There are 16 cases in Central Zone, five cases in Northern Zone and one case in Western Zone. There is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and northern Nova Scotia.

There are no new cases at the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash. A total of 32 residents and 11 staff members at the home have tested positive, and three of the infected residents have died. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

“Today we lost another Nova Scotian to this virus, and I offer my prayers and condolences to the family and loved ones of the man who passed,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Each person we lose is not just a reminder that COVID-19 persists as a very real threat, but it breaks my heart to know that another family is grieving the loss of a loved one before their time.”

On November 24, eight schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 169 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 17 people are in hospital, including five in ICU.

On November 24, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,778 tests.

As of November 24, 1,625,969 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 788,242 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 15,021 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 2,245 positive COVID-19 cases and 14 deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 2,062 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Department of Public Works staff and crews are working to address the impact of Tuesday’s heavy rain and wind event which caused flooding and washouts in parts of Nova Scotia with Victoria, Antigonish and Inverness counties hit hardest.

At this time, the rainstorm has resulted in the closure of more than 25 roads in eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, with washouts on the Cabot Trail, as well as some roads in northern Nova Scotia.

“This week’s storm has hit our province, our people and our transportation infrastructure hard, particularly in Inverness, Victoria and Antigonish counties,” said acting Public Works Minister Allan MacMaster. “Our first priority is making sure people are safe, so please check in with your neighbours, especially seniors. Many people – including Public Works crews, Emergency Management Office staff, power crews, and municipal staff ¬– worked through the night to assess and repair the damage. This is difficult work, and I know they are responding as fast as they can while working safely. I want to thank them for all their efforts and those affected for their patience.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is encouraging all Nova Scotians to prepare themselves and their vehicles for winter conditions before the snow starts to fall.

“As Nova Scotians, we know our weather can be unpredictable,” said Finance and Treasury Board Minister Allan MacMaster, on behalf of Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “That’s why it’s so important to be prepared. Just as our maintenance staff and operators are getting ready to keep provincial roads safe, we want to remind Nova Scotians to get ready for safe winter driving, too.”

Booking a service appointment is the first step in being prepared for snow and ice on the roads. Vehicles should have snow tires, antifreeze and an emergency kit.

Other winter driving tips include:
-- wear seatbelts (seatbelts are required year round)
-- slow down and leave additional space between vehicles – it takes more time and distance to brake in adverse conditions
-- maintain a safe distance from snowplows to give operators room to do their job
-- keep the gas tank at least half full
-- plan ahead and include extra time for possible delays.

To help spread the word about winter preparedness and road safety, the Province is running its annual Be Winter Ready campaign. Featuring television, radio and online ads, the campaign promotes safe driving tips and shares details about the tools and services that are available to make winter driving easier and safer.

Quotes:
""I encourage everyone to be mindful of winter road conditions, but also the human conditions before deciding to drive. Give yourself adequate time, slow down and always drive sober and distraction free. If you feel you need to interject before someone else drives when conditions are unsafe, please do your part to keep them and others road users safe. Please enjoy this holiday season safely and responsibly.”
     - Inspector Don Moser, Assistant Support Services Officer, Nova Scotia RCMP

Quick Facts:
-- in the winter months, the Department of Public Works is responsible for keeping provincial roads, highways  and bridges safe and as clear as possible
-- Public Works operates more than 400 snowplows and other snow-clearing vehicles, and crews are on the job 24/7 
-- provincial highway cameras are available online so Nova Scotians can see first-hand how weather may be affecting their route

"Public Works","On encourage les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à se préparer pour l'hiver","TRAVAUX PUBLICS--On encourage les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à se préparer pour l'hiver
----------------------------------------------------------------
Le gouvernement provincial encourage tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse à se préparer et à préparer leurs véhicules pour les conditions hivernales avant l'arrivée de la première neige.

« Nous savons que la météo peut être imprévisible dans notre province, affirme Allan MacMaster, ministre des Finances et du Conseil du Trésor, au nom de Kim Masland, ministre des Travaux publics. C'est pourquoi il est important de se préparer. Notre personnel d'entretien et les conducteurs de chasse-neige se préparent à assurer le déneigement de nos routes provinciales, et nous rappelons aux gens aussi de se préparer pour la conduite en conditions hivernales. »

Prendre rendez-vous pour l'entretien de votre véhicule est la première chose à faire pour vous préparer à conduire sur les routes enneigées et glacées. Les véhicules devraient être dotés de pneus d'hiver, d'antigel et d'une trousse d'urgence.

Voici d'autres conseils pour la conduite en hiver :
-- Portez votre ceinture de sécurité (il s'agit d'une exigence qui s'applique à longueur d'année).
-- Ralentissez et laissez suffisamment d'espace entre les véhicules, car il faut plus de temps et de distance pour freiner en cas de mauvais temps.
-- Restez à une distance sécuritaire des chasse-neige pour leur permettre de faire leur travail.
-- Gardez votre réservoir à essence au moins à moitié plein.
-- Prévoyez et accordez-vous du temps supplémentaire en cas de retards. 

Afin de sensibiliser les gens à la préparation et à la sécurité routière, la Province lance sa campagne annuelle de préparation pour l'hiver. La campagne inclut des annonces à la télévision, à la radio et en ligne, et elle offre des conseils sur la sécurité routière et des renseignements sur les outils et les services qui sont offerts pour faciliter la conduite en hiver en toute sécurité.

Citation
« J'encourage tout le monde à être attentif aux conditions routières hivernales, mais aussi aux conditions humaines avant de prendre le volant. Accordez-vous suffisamment de temps, ralentissez et conduisez toujours sobre et sans distractions. Si vous ressentez le besoin d'intervenir et d'empêcher quelqu'un d'autre de conduire lorsque les conditions sont dangereuses, faites-le pour assurer leur sécurité et celle des autres. Profitez bien de la saison des fêtes de façon sécuritaire et responsable. »
     - Inspecteur Don Moser, officier responsable adjoint des services de soutien de la GRC en Nouvelle-Écosse

Faits en bref
-- Pendant l'hiver, le ministère des Travaux publics est responsable de la sécurité et du déneigement des routes provinciales, des autoroutes et des ponts.
-- Le ministère des Travaux publics compte plus de 400 chasse-neige et autres véhicules de déneigement, et les équipes sont au travail 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7. 
-- Les caméras routières provinciales sont disponibles en ligne pour permettre aux gens de voir directement les conditions météorologiques sur leur route.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Troisième mise à jour sur la vaccination obligatoire","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Troisième mise à jour sur la vaccination obligatoire 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 24 novembre, le gouvernement provincial publie une mise à jour sur le taux de vaccination contre la COVID-19 dans les secteurs clés et au sujet de la directive concernant la vaccination de la fonction publique provinciale.

Tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre. Les personnes partiellement vaccinées pourront devoir faire l'objet d'autres mesures de sécurité, y compris le test de dépistage. Les employés qui n'auront pas reçu leur première dose au 30 novembre subiront des conséquences liées à leur emploi, y compris en congé non rémunéré.

« Nous sommes d'avis que les gens qui travaillent dans ces secteurs doivent être vaccinés pour protéger les personnes à qui ils offrent des soins, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. La protection des personnes vulnérables de la province est la chose la plus importante. Nous prendrons les mesures nécessaires concernant l'impact sur les services et le niveau de dotation qui pourrait se produire si des personnes choisissent de quitter leur emploi plutôt que de recevoir un vaccin qui sauve des vies. Si vous n'êtes pas encore vacciné, il n'est pas trop tard. Je vous encourage à bien choisir. »

Les taux de vaccination des employés dans les secteurs de la santé, de l'éducation et des soins de longue durée touchées par la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 qui ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal sont les suivants :
-- Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse : 95 % sont entièrement vaccinés (comparé à 94 % le 16 novembre), 4 % sont partiellement vaccinés et 90 % ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal (comparé à 88 %)

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Third Update on Vaccination Mandates","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Third Update on Vaccination Mandates 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is releasing an update on the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for key sectors and the provincial civil service vaccination directive today, November 24.

Under both, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subject to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will face employment consequences, including unpaid leave.

“We believe that people who work in these sectors must be vaccinated to protect the people they care for,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Protecting vulnerable Nova Scotians is the most important thing. We will deal with potential impacts to services and staffing levels that may result from people choosing to leave, rather than get a life-saving vaccine. If you haven’t been vaccinated yet, it’s not too late. I encourage you to make the right choice.”

The vaccination rates of employees in the health, education and the long-term care sectors included in the COVID-19 vaccination mandate who have reported are:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority: 95 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 94 per cent on November 16), four per cent partially vaccinated, with 90 per cent reporting (up from 88 per cent)
-- IWK Health Centre: 99 per cent (no change), one per cent partially vaccinated, with 99 per cent reporting (no change)
-- long-term care: 95 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 93), three per cent partially vaccinated, with 95 per cent reporting (up from 89 per cent)
-- home care: 95 per cent fully vaccinated (up from 89), four per cent partially vaccinated, with 97 per cent reporting (up from 78 per cent)
-- education: 97 per cent fully vaccinated (no change), two per cent partially vaccinated, with 90 per cent reporting (up from 75 per cent)
-- Emergency Health Services (EHS): 99 per cent fully vaccinated (no change), one per cent partially vaccinated, with 92 per cent reporting (up from 88 per cent)

The following sectors are being included in the COVID-19 vaccination mandate update for the first time:
-- adult day programs (Seniors and Long-term Care): 94 per cent fully vaccinated, no employees partially vaccinated, with 97 per cent reporting
-- correctional services: 99 per cent fully vaccinated, one per cent partially vaccinated, with 68 per cent reporting
-- Community Services (Disability Support Program and Child and Youth Caring Program): 93 per cent fully vaccinated, seven per cent partially vaccinated, with 96 per cent reporting
-- daycares: 93 per cent full vaccinated, five per cent partially vaccinated, with 84 per cent of facilities reporting
-- Hearing and Speech NS: 99 per cent fully vaccinated, no employees partially vaccinated, with 95 per cent reporting.

Under the provincial civil service vaccination directive, all direct employees of the provincial government are required to be vaccinated. The vaccination rates among government employees who have reported their status are 97 per cent fully vaccinated, two per cent partially vaccinated, with 93 per cent reporting.

Vaccination rates are as of November 23; percentages have been rounded.

Data collection continues and final numbers will be released in early December.

Quick Facts:
-- under the COVID-19 vaccination mandate employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination up to 70 days after their first dose; those who are partially vaccinated may be subjected to other health and safety measures, including testing; those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will be placed on unpaid leave
-- under the provincial civil service vaccination directive, employees must have at first dose of the vaccine by November 30 with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination up to 56 days after their first dose; those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will face employment consequences up to and including unpaid leave

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 24 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 20 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 31 rétablissements.

Il y a 12 cas dans le secteur du centre, 6 dans le secteur du nord et 2 dans le secteur de l'est. Il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Aucun nouveau cas n'est signalé aujourd'hui au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge de Pugwash. Un total de 32 résidents et 11 membres du personnel du foyer de soins ont contracté la COVID-19, et trois de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 23 novembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 172 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix-huit personnes sont hospitalisées, dont six aux soins intensifs.

Le 23 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 323 tests.

Au 23 novembre, 1 622 765 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 787 353 étaient une deuxième dose, et 13 160 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 223 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 13 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 2 038. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 28 novembre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 24, Nova Scotia is reporting 20 new cases of COVID-19 and 31 recoveries.

There are 12 cases in Central Zone, six cases in Northern Zone and two cases in Eastern Zone. There is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and northern Nova Scotia.

On November 23, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 172 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 18 people are in hospital, including six in ICU.

On November 23, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,323 tests.

As of November 23, 1,622,765 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 787,353 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 13,160 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting Nova Scotians that Royal FX Trading Ltd. (Royal FX), operating online at www.royalfxtrading.com, is not registered to engage in the business of trading or advising in securities or derivatives in Nova Scotia.

At least one Nova Scotian has reported losing funds by making what was believed to be an investment with Royal FX. After learning about Royal FX from a YouTube video, they received instructions via a chat box to transfer funds to purchase Bitcoin and open an investment account. Although they received a statement showing significant growth in their account within one month, a request to withdraw funds was met with a fee payment requirement and no further contact from Royal FX.

The Commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with firms that are not registered in Nova Scotia. People who have had contact with Royal FX should contact the Commission. People can contact the Commission to report suspicious behavior from anyone offering investment opportunities.

Quotes:
“Protect your financial well-being by taking the time to become informed. Always verify the registration status of an individual or company offering an investment opportunity and search for information about them online. Be wary of guaranteed returns and opportunities that are difficult to understand. All investments carry risk and if an investment sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”

Quick Facts:
-- it is illegal to solicit investments in Nova Scotia without registering with the Commission and complying with Nova Scotia securities laws, unless an exemption applies

Today, November 23, Nova Scotia is reporting 29 new cases of COVID-19 and 37 recoveries.

There are 21 cases in Central Zone, six cases in Northern Zone and two cases in Western Zone. There is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and northern Nova Scotia.

Another staff member at East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in Pugwash, has tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 32 residents and 11 staff members at the home have tested positive, and three of the infected residents have died. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On November 22, seven schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 184 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 18 people are in hospital, including six in ICU.

On November 22, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,924 tests.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to November 28, 2021

Aujourd'hui 23 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 29 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 37 rétablissements.

Il y a 21 cas dans le secteur du centre, 6 dans le secteur du nord et 2 dans le secteur de l'ouest. Il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Un autre membre du personnel du foyer East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Un total de 32 résidents et 11 membres du personnel ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19, et trois de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 22 novembre, on a avisé sept écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 184 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix-huit personnes sont hospitalisées, dont six aux soins intensifs.

Le 22 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 924 tests.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 204 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 13 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Today, November 22, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 90s in Western Zone has died.

“COVID-19 is still here. It isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and it continues to take loved ones away from family and friends,” said Premier Tim Houston. “My thoughts are with everyone who is grieving. Let’s prevent anyone else from going through this pain by getting fully vaccinated, staying home if you are sick and following public health measures.”

Nova Scotia is also reporting 60 new cases of COVID-19 and 88 recoveries since the last update November 19.

There are 35 cases in Central Zone, 18 cases in Northern Zone, six cases in Western Zone and one case in Eastern Zone. There is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and northern Nova Scotia. 

There are no new cases today at East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in Pugwash.

Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of the man who has passed,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The vaccine can help prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death. Please do your part and get vaccinated if you haven’t done so already and keep doing all you can to protect each other.”

Over the past three days, eight schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious.

Aujourd'hui 22 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Un nonagénaire est décédé dans le secteur de l'ouest.

« La COVID-19 est toujours présente ici, et elle le sera pendant encore longtemps. Elle continue d'emporter nos proches, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Mes pensées accompagnent toutes les personnes qui sont en deuil. Prévenons cette douleur en nous faisant vacciner, en restant à la maison si nous sommes malades et en respectant les mesures de santé publique. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 60 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 88 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 19 novembre.

Il y a 35 cas dans le secteur du centre, 18 dans le secteur du nord, 6 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 1 dans le secteur de l'est. Il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse.

Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

« J'offre mes sincères condoléances à la famille et aux proches de l'homme qui est décédé, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Le vaccin peut prévenir des symptômes graves, l'hospitalisation et la mort. Faites le nécessaire et faites-vous vacciner si ce n'est pas déjà fait, et continuez de vous protéger les uns les autres. »

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé huit écoles d'une ou de plusieurs expositions dans leur établissement.

-----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians need and deserve safe, affordable places to call home. On National Housing Day, today, November 22, the Province announced a $6.4 million investment to build about 200 new affordable rental units in Kentville, Lantz, Halifax and Cole Harbour.

These units will rent for at least 20 per cent below market value. The projects include:
-- in Kentville, a 100-unit development, all units affordable, by Tiny Home Development, RFL Group
-- in Lantz, 40 affordable units in an 85-unit development by Shaw Group Ltd.
-- in Halifax, 38 affordable units in a 100-unit development by Art House Lofts, Sidewalk Real Estate Development.

The Province has also issued a call for partnership for an affordable housing project to be built on provincial land on Circassion Drive in Cole Harbour. It is expected up to 15 affordable housing units could be built on this land.

“This is only the beginning. We’ll be announcing more affordable housing projects in the coming months in communities across Nova Scotia and making provincial land available for affordable housing developments,” said Advanced Education Minister Brian Wong, on behalf of Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “The need for more housing supply is urgent. Nova Scotians need us to act quickly, and we are.”

The Province is also announcing over $400,000 to help five community housing groups that are working to increase affordable housing in the province:
-- Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada
-- Portal Youth Outreach Association, Annapolis Valley
-- Transition House Association of Nova Scotia
-- Upper Hammonds Plains Community Land Trust
-- Urban Neighborhood Development Association

As well, Portal Youth Outreach Association will receive nearly $190,000 for upgrades at three youth shelters, in Kentville, Windsor and Middleton. And Shelter Nova Scotia will receive about $84,000 for upgrades at Metro Turning Point and Barry House, two Halifax shelters.

Quotes:
“The Shaw Group is extremely pleased to participate with the Province of Nova Scotia on this affordable housing project. There is a definitive need for affordable housing in every community in Nova Scotia, and we are delighted that our community in Lantz can be part of this effort.”
     - Dean Robertson, CEO, The Shaw Group Ltd.

“This is a great step for our community stakeholders and municipalities in the Annapolis Valley. The dream of people of all ages – thriving in safe, nurturing and secure homes – is one step closer.”
     - Russ Sanche, Executive Director, Portal Youth Outreach Association

“The Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada, in partnership with the Community Housing Management Network, is pleased to continue our work with the Province to find solutions to sustain and grow the co-operative and non-profit housing sector in Nova Scotia. This funding, combined with our collaborative approach, will be instrumental in the development of a community housing land trust model that meets the specific needs of Nova Scotians.”
     - Karen Brodeur, Manager, Atlantic Canada, Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada

Quick Facts:
-- the Affordable Housing Commission recommended mixed-income developments be prioritized as the Province builds more affordable housing
-- the projects listed above will all be mixed-income, and they were chosen because they are on municipally serviced lots with access to transit and nearby amenities
-- in Halifax, it’s estimated a one-bedroom unit will rent for $1,016; in Kentville, rents are estimated to be $1,200 a month for two- to three-bedroom homes
-- the vacancy rate in Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) is 1.0 per cent; the provincial vacancy rate is 2.1 per cent
-- the average rental rate in HRM increased by 4.1 per cent in 2020

-------------------------------------------------------
Batten down the hatches and put away that lawn furniture, Nova Scotia – there’s a storm coming Monday.

The Emergency Management Office (EMO) is advising Nova Scotians to take steps now to protect themselves, their loved ones and their property in advance of Monday’s predicted storm. 

Environment Canada is forecasting heavy rain and strong winds starting Monday morning, particularly in parts of Cape Breton and the Halifax area. Some parts of northern Nova Scotia may see snow. These events may cause flooding, storm surges and power outages.

Storm preparation checklist:
-- have enough food and water on hand for 72 hours
-- monitor local media outlets for updates
-- secure gates, doors and windows
-- move lawn furniture and secure trash cans, hanging plants and anything that can be picked up by wind
-- check radio and flashlight batteries
-- make sure vehicles have enough fuel, and park away from trees 
-- make sure cell phones are charged before the storm
-- keep pets inside
-- move boats or other watercraft to high ground
-- make sure you and your family are safe, and check on your neighbours
-- if the power goes out, do not leave candles unattended.

EMO is working with Environment Canada and partners on the approaching storm, gathering municipal information, identifying possible local risk areas and keeping in close touch with provincial and municipal emergency management officers and co-ordinators.

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 19 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Une nonagénaire ayant des troubles médicaux sous-jacents est décédée dans le secteur du nord à la suite de complications liées à la COVID-19. Elle était résidente au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash.

« Il s'agit d'un triste jour, et je transmets mes condoléances à la famille et aux proches de la personne décédée, ainsi qu'à tout le monde au foyer East Cumberland Lodge, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Je demande à tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de faire leur possible pour éviter la propagation de la COVID-19 dans nos établissements de soins de longue durée et dans nos communautés. Il faut donc se faire vacciner, rester à la maison si on est malade et respecter les mesures de santé publique. »

Le décès lié au foyer de soins de longue durée sera inclus au tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19 lorsqu'il sera mis à jour lundi.

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également 27 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 40 rétablissements.

Il y a treize cas dans le secteur du centre, sept dans le secteur de l'ouest, six dans le secteur du nord et un dans le secteur de l'est. Il y a également transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Un autre résident du foyer East Cumberland Lodge a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Un total de 32 résidents et 10 membres du personnel ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19, et trois de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

« J'offre mes sincères condoléances à la famille et aux proches de la dame qui est décédée, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Il est important de comprendre que la Nouvelle-Écosse continue de dépister des nouveaux cas de COVID-19. Nous ne sommes pas encore au bout du tunnel. Nous devons demeurer vigilants, particulièrement pour protéger les résidents et le personnel des foyers de soins de longue durée. »

Le 18 novembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Il y a eu 102 cas de COVID-19 dont l'épisode est survenu entre le 11 et le 18 novembre. De ce nombre :

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 223 cas actifs de COVID-19. Quinze personnes sont hospitalisées, dont sept aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 30 193 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 12 au 18 novembre. Cela comprend 2 050 tests de dépistage rapide dans les cliniques temporaires d'Halifax, de Dartmouth, de Bear River, de Digby, de Weymouth et de Yarmouth, et 28 143 tests de dépistage rapide administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. De plus, 12 649 tests rapides à faire à la maison ont été distribués dans les cliniques temporaires.

Le 18 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 942 tests.

Au 18 novembre, 1 616 350 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 785 380 étaient une deuxième dose, et 9 729 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 882. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 28 novembre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 19, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A woman in her 90s with underlying medical conditions in Northern Zone has died as a result of complications related to COVID-19. She was a resident of the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash.

“This is a very sad day and I send my sympathies to the family and loved ones of the woman who has passed, as well as everyone at East Cumberland Lodge,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I ask all Nova Scotians to do everything you can to help keep COVID-19 out of our long-term care facilities and our communities. This means getting fully vaccinated, staying home if you are sick and following public health measures.”

Today’s death connected to the long-term care home will be reflected on the COVID-19 dashboard when it is updated Monday.

Nova Scotia is also reporting 27 new cases of COVID-19 and 40 recoveries.

There are 13 cases in Central Zone, seven cases in Western Zone, six cases in Northern Zone and one case in Eastern Zone. There is also evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and northern Nova Scotia. 

Another resident at East Cumberland Lodge has tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 32 residents and 10 staff members at the home have tested positive, and three of the infected residents have died. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

“My heartfelt condolences go out to the family and loved ones of the woman who has passed,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “It is important everyone understands Nova Scotia continues to see new cases of COVID-19 – we are not out of the woods yet. We must remain vigilant, especially to protect residents and staff at long-term care homes.”

On November 18, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

There have been 102 cases of COVID-19 with an episode date between November 11 and November 18. Of those:

-- 37 (36.2 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 3 (2.9 per cent) were partially vaccinated

There have been 6,306 cases from March 15 to November 18. Of those:

-- 590 (9.4 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 391 (6.2 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 5,325 (84.4 per cent) were unvaccinated

There were 325 people hospitalized. Of those:

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

REMARQUE : Déclaration de la ministre de la Santé et du Mieux-être, Michelle Thompson.
-------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui, j'ai été ravie d'apprendre que Santé Canada a approuvé le vaccin de Pfizer contre la COVID-19 pour les enfants de 5 à 11 ans. De plus, le Comité consultatif national de l'immunisation (CCNI) a publié ses recommandations pour l'utilisation du vaccin pédiatrique contre la COVID-19 pour ce groupe d'âge.

Il s'agit d'excellentes nouvelles. Nous pourrons bientôt protéger un plus grand nombre de personnes de la Nouvelle-Écosse contre le virus.

La Nouvelle-Écosse suit les lignes directrices et les recommandations du CCNI dans son programme de vaccination. La Santé publique évalue actuellement les plus récentes recommandations et la façon dont nous allons adapter notre programme de vaccination pour appuyer la vaccination des enfants de ce groupe d'âge.

Nous nous attendions à cette annonce depuis plusieurs semaines, et nous avons déjà commencé à collaborer avec nos partenaires du système de santé et du système de rendez-vous pour les vaccins afin d'élaborer un plan. Nous attendons maintenant des renseignements de nos partenaires fédéraux concernant la façon d'offrir les vaccins avant de finaliser notre plan.

Nous serons en mesure de transmettre des renseignements supplémentaires aux familles la semaine prochaine.

NOTE: The following is a statement from Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson.
--------------------------------------------------------
Today, I was pleased to hear that Health Canada has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. At the same time, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has released its recommendations for use of the pediatric COVID-19 vaccine for this age group.

This is great news. Soon, we will be able to protect more Nova Scotians against the virus.

Nova Scotia relies on the guidance and recommendations of NACI in our vaccine rollout. Public health is reviewing the latest recommendations and how we adapt our vaccine rollout to support vaccination within this age group.

We have been anticipating this announcement for weeks and have been working with our health system partners and our vaccine booking system on a plan. We are now waiting on information from our federal partners regarding vaccine delivery to finalize our planning.

We look forward to sharing more information with families next week.

---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Premier Tim Houston will make his first trip as Premier to Ottawa to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, November 22. 

The two leaders will begin discussions on Nova Scotia priorities and common interests between the Province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada, including improving access to healthcare, advancing climate change and environmental goals, increasing immigration and continuing to work collaboratively to increase the affordable housing supply.  

“We can do so much more when we work together across both levels of government,” said Premier Houston. “I welcome the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Trudeau and discuss solutions to the big challenges, like achieving truly universal mental healthcare. This is one of the first priorities that we want to work with the federal government on.” 

The Province also wants to work with the federal government on growing the population to two million people by 2060. 

This collaboration has already started with initiatives like the Atlantic Immigration Program. The program helps employers in Atlantic Canada hire foreign skilled workers who want to immigrate to Atlantic Canada, as well as international post-secondary students who want to stay in Atlantic Canada after they graduate. Nova Scotia currently has more than 1,500 designated employers across many key sectors. Due to its success, the Government of Canada is making this a permanent program.

“We need support from the federal government to reduce processing times for applicants seeking permanent residency, increase our immigration allocation numbers, and increase support for training to address our labour market needs,” said Premier Houston. “I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Trudeau and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada Minister Sean Fraser on these important issues.” 

Another issue the Premier will raise is completing the Atlantic Loop and partnering on more clean energy projects to achieve the goals outlined in the Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act. 

“Nova Scotians expect us to act urgently and decisively when it comes to climate change. The federal government and Nova Scotia share a common goal – a cleaner and more prosperous future for Nova Scotians and Canadians,” said Premier Houston. “We have some of the most aggressive targets to reduce greenhouse emissions in the country. I value the federal government as a partner, and it only makes sense that we work together to fight climate change.

Quick Facts:
-- Premier Houston will travel to Ottawa Sunday, November 21, and return Tuesday, November 23

"Health and Wellness","Urgent Treatment Centre to Open in Parrsboro","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Urgent Treatment Centre to Open in Parrsboro
-----------------------------------------------------------
Residents of Parrsboro and surrounding communities will soon have local access to urgent healthcare treatment.

Starting mid-December, the Parrsboro Urgent Treatment Centre, located at South Cumberland Community Care Centre, will provide care for people with unexpected, non-life-threatening health concerns that require same or next day treatment. Some examples include earaches, sore throat, minor cuts, strains and sprains, and mild mental health support. 

The centre is available to people with or without a family doctor or nurse practitioner.

“We need to find new and innovative ways to deliver healthcare to Nova Scotians,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Urgent treatment centres help ease the burden on our hospitals and provide timely care to those without a family doctor who have health concerns. I look forward to seeing more of these across the province.”

This new model of care will replace the collaborative emergency centre at South Cumberland Community Care Centre that closed in March 2020 to support operational and public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The urgent treatment centre will differ from an emergency department in several ways: care provided is for non-life-threatening injuries and illness; ambulances do not bring patients to the centre; service is available by appointment (usually either same day or next day) or walk in. Patients requiring emergency care should continue to call 911.

A public education session about the new centre is planned for December 8 at 6 p.m. at the Parrsboro Fire Hall. Due to COVID-19 gathering limits, registration is required. Nova Scotia Health will provide registration information soon. Proof of vaccination will be required for attendance and masks must be worn.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotians have been clear about the need to improve access to primary healthcare in this province. We know that many patients in our hospitals’ emergency departments are seen for non-urgent health concerns because they feel like there is no other option. This new urgent treatment centre will give a more accessible, timely and appropriate option for the people of Cumberland South to receive care for their unexpected urgent health needs.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“Our team is excited to introduce this new innovative model to Parrsboro, Advocate Harbour and surrounding communities. The service model reflects the healthcare needs of the community and will provide timely and predictable care where and when people need it most. Patients need flexible options when accessing care and the urgent treatment centre provides this.”
     - Dr. Aaron Smith, Medical Executive Director, Northern Zone, Nova Scotia Health

“Having been without urgent care on the Parrsboro Shore for the past 20 months, the community of Parrsboro is pleased and relieved that we will soon have this service available again in our area. As a community, we appreciate the work that has been done by all stakeholders to make this a reality and look forward to the opening and ongoing evaluation of this service to ensure we continue to receive the best urgent care possible as needs evolve in the future.”
     - John Crant, President, Parrsboro and District Board of Trade

About the Parrsboro Urgent Treatment Centre:
The centre will operate five days a week, including early evenings and one weekend day. Patients can book an appointment or go to the centre in person, where they will be assessed by a doctor or nurse practitioner to determine if they will be scheduled for an appointment, usually later that day or the next day.

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness","Office Finding Innovative Solutions for Healthcare Recruitment","PREMIER’S OFFICE/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Office Finding Innovative Solutions for Healthcare Recruitment
----------------------------------------------------------------
The new Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment has hit the ground running to ensure the Province recruits and retains enough doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals for Nova Scotians to get the care they need.

“We’re doing things differently to solve healthcare problems in Nova Scotia,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “That means developing comprehensive strategies and out-of-the-box approaches. We’re already guaranteeing a job for every graduating nurse who wants to work in Nova Scotia. More innovative actions like this are coming.”

The Office is working with communities and key partners and stakeholders – within and outside government – to understand what is working, where there are gaps and challenges, and how to seize opportunities to boost the recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals.

Initiatives underway include:
-- ensuring incentives help to not only recruit but also retain healthcare professionals
-- developing a Nursing Mentorship Program and an online tool to help match new graduates with jobs in Nova Scotia
-- working with Emergency Health Services (EHS) to continue recent progress on recruitment and retention of paramedics
-- exploring ways to connect more community-based doctors with certain specialists 
-- exploring onsite child care in long-term care facilities to help recruit and retain continuing care assistants.

The Office is organizing meetings with all family medicine residents across the province, starting in Cape Breton. The Office is also working with Dalhousie Medical School and community groups so these residents can visit clinics and connect with practising doctors.

For fully licensed doctors in other parts of Canada, the College of Physicians and Surgeons has already streamlined the process for getting licensed in Nova Scotia, making it faster and easier. There is now minimal documentation required and a licence can be issued in a few days or less.

Quotes: 
“The Office is committed to coming up with creative and innovative solutions to recruit and retain all sorts of highly qualified healthcare professionals to our province. Getting out and connecting with people in all corners of our healthcare system is key to building a system that’s accessible and properly staffed to serve Nova Scotians.”
     - Dr. Kevin Orrell, Deputy Minister and CEO, Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment

“The fully licensed doctor elsewhere in Canada wishing to practice here will be licensed in Nova Scotia quickly and without hassle. We are working closely with Dr. Orrell and his team to support their recruitment efforts.”
     - Dr. Gus Grant, Registrar and CEO, Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","22 New Cases of COVID-19, 22 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--22 New Cases of COVID-19, 22 Recoveries 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 18, Nova Scotia is reporting 22 new cases of COVID-19 and 22 recoveries.

There are 12 cases in Central Zone, seven cases in Western Zone and three cases in Northern Zone.

There are active cases in all health zones and evidence of limited community spread in Halifax and northern Nova Scotia. 

There are no new cases today at East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in Pugwash. A total of 31 residents and 10 staff members at the home have tested positive for COVID-19, and two of the infected residents have died. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On November 17, two schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 236 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 17 people are in hospital, including seven in ICU.

On November 17, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,720 tests.

As of November 17, 1,614,902 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 784,644 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 9,327 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 18 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 22 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 22 rétablissements.

Il y a douze cas dans le secteur du centre, sept dans le secteur de l'ouest et trois dans le secteur du nord.

Il y a des cas actifs dans tous les secteurs et il y a transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Aucun nouveau cas n'est signalé aujourd'hui au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge de Pugwash. Un total de 31 résidents et 10 membres du personnel du foyer de soins ont contracté la COVID-19, et deux de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 17 novembre, on a avisé deux écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 236 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix-sept personnes sont hospitalisées, dont sept aux soins intensifs.

Le 17 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 720 tests.

Au 17 novembre, 1 614 902 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 784 644 étaient une deuxième dose, et 9 327 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 089 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 11 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 842. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 28 novembre 2021.

"Justice / Premier's Office / COVID - 19","Fines Increasing, New Offence Category Under Health Protection Act","PREMIER’S OFFICE/JUSTICE/COVID-19--Fines Increasing, New Offence Category Under Health Protection Act
-----------------------------------------------------
Individuals and organizations hosting events or gatherings that ignore public health orders are now subject to penalties under the Health Protection Act.

This is a new category of offence that will hold organizers directly responsible for contravening the act and putting themselves and others in danger.

Fines will start at the highest maximum penalty under the act of $2,422 for a first offence and increase to $11,622 for individuals who either organize or attend an illegal gathering. Organizations will be fined the highest maximum penalty under the act of $11,622 for a first offence and $57,622 for the second and each subsequent offence. Individuals can also face jail time. The fines include victim surcharge and other court fees.

The new fines are effective immediately.

“I don’t want any more loved ones being lost due to this type of reckless behaviour and the fines that were in place were not enough to discourage it,” said Premier Tim Houston. “My hope is that by substantially increasing fines and increasing enforcement we can save lives.”

Quick Facts:
-- police and provincial inspectors are authorized to enforce orders under the Health Protection Act
-- fines were last increased in April
-- more than 1,375 summary offence tickets have been issued under the Health Protection and Emergency Management acts since the provincial state of emergency was declared
-- fines issued under the Health Protection Act total $1.7 million

"Health and Wellness","Province Covers Cost of New Cystic Fibrosis Drug","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Province Covers Cost of New Cystic Fibrosis Drug	
---------------------------------------------------
Starting today, November 18, Nova Scotia will provide additional support for cystic fibrosis patients by fully covering the cost of the drug Trikafta.

Cystic fibrosis is a rare and progressive genetic disease that affects children and adults. Trikafta is used to treat the most common form of the disease, seen in about 90 per cent of patients.

“Providing access to this game-changing drug as soon as possible and at no cost to the patient was our goal,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “This is at the core of what we want to do to improve the health and well-being of Nova Scotians – giving patients access to innovative and effective treatments.”

Trikafta costs approximately $300,000 per patient per year.

Health Canada approved Trikafta in June. The approval process included a review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, and coverage in Nova Scotia will be based on the agency’s recommendations. Patients who do not meet the specific criteria regarding lung function will be assessed for coverage on a case-by-case basis as recommended by their specialist.

Quotes:
“Trikafta is the single greatest innovation in cystic fibrosis history, and it has the power to transform the lives of thousands of Canadians. The cystic fibrosis community in Nova Scotia has fought long and hard to get this drug into their hands. Access to Trikafta will mean longer and healthier lives for many people and the ability to plan for a future that many feared they might not live to see.”
     - Kelly Grover, President and CEO, Cystic Fibrosis Canada

“Today is truly a life-changing day for many people impacted by cystic fibrosis in Nova Scotia. Trikafta targets the root cause of cystic fibrosis and helps break the cycle of infection and deteriorating lung function. Our son calls this drug a ‘dream come true.’ We are forever grateful to the CF community for their efforts in making this day a reality. While this is an exciting day, we look forward to the day when every Canadian who needs Trikafta can access it.”
     - Anne Marie Drake, advocate and mother of sons living with cystic fibrosis

Quick Facts:
-- cystic fibrosis causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract and other parts of the body; it causes persistent lung infections and leads to loss of lung function
-- it is estimated that one in every 3,600 children born in Canada has cystic fibrosis; there is currently no cure for cystic fibrosis
-- an estimated 190 Nova Scotians have cystic fibrosis
-- the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health provides critical insight from patients, clinicians and experts to ensure drug funding recommendations are evidence-based and consider clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness
-- the provinces and territories accelerated the negotiations process to reach an agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals for Trikafta and two other cystic fibrosis medications – Orkambi and Kalydeco

--------------------------------------------------------
Robert Smith, pastor of the Gospel Light Baptist Church in Amherst, has been fined for a gathering which contravened the COVID-19 order under the Health Protection Act.

The gathering took place from October 25 to 29 in Amherst.

The summary offence ticket was issued today, November 17 by the inspection, compliance and enforcement division of the Department of Environment and Climate Change after an investigation. The fine amount was $2,422.

Police are responsible for investigating any possible criminal aspect which would involve the laying of charges under the Criminal Code.

“I am upset and concerned by this situation which was preventable and shows a complete disregard for public health measures meant to keep us all safe. Because of the actions of a reckless few, we now have a spike in cases related to an illegal gathering in the Northern zone in late October,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I hope Nova Scotians who are looking for loopholes or to disregard the Public Health Order will see this as an example of there being zero tolerance for this behaviour. Those who choose to disregard the law and put others at risk may be fined or possibly face other charges.”

As a result of the faith-based gathering where many who attended were not vaccinated, there has been secondary transmission of COVID-19 in Northern and Western health zones, workplaces and the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home. The home has had 31 residents and 10 staff test positive for COVID-19, and two of the infected residents have died. Another death in Northern Zone has also been linked to the gathering.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","20 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 36 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--20 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 36 cas résolus 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 17 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 20 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 36 rétablissements.

Il y a huit cas dans le secteur du centre, six dans le secteur du nord et six dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Il y a des cas actifs dans tous les secteurs et il y a transmission communautaire limitée à Halifax et dans le nord de la Nouvelle-Écosse. 

Aucun nouveau cas n'est signalé aujourd'hui au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge de Pugwash. Un total de 31 résidents et 10 membres du personnel du foyer de soins ont contracté la COVID-19, et deux de ces résidents sont décédés. Les responsables de la santé publique et de la santé au travail collaborent avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 16 novembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 236 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix-sept personnes sont hospitalisées, dont sept aux soins intensifs.

Le 16 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 422 tests.

Au 16 novembre, 1 613 097 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 783 666 étaient une deuxième dose, et 8 866 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 067 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 11 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 820. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 28 novembre 2021.

Selon la politique, tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre et sont tenus de présenter une preuve de vaccination complète 70 jours après leur première dose. Les personnes partiellement vaccinées pourraient devoir faire l'objet d'autres mesures de sécurité, y compris le test de dépistage. Les employés qui n'auront pas reçu leur première dose au 30 novembre seront mis en congé non rémunéré. 

Au 16 novembre, les taux de vaccination des employés qui ont déclaré leur statut vaccinal sont les suivants :

La collecte des données se poursuit et une autre mise à jour sur ces chiffres sera publiée le 24 novembre; les statistiques finales seront publiées au début de décembre. 

Les employés qui n'ont pas présenté leur preuve de vaccination ou qui ont indiqué ne pas avoir l'intention de se faire vacciner doivent suivre un programme d'éducation obligatoire.

The Province is releasing a second update on the vaccination rates of workers in healthcare, long-term care, education and emergency health services today, November 17.

Employers are required to collect and report vaccination rates as part of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate announced September 29.

Under the mandate, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination 70 days after their first dose. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subjected to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will be placed on unpaid leave.

NOTE: The following is a statement from Public Works Minister Kim Masland
------------------------------------------------- 
This morning I received the upsetting news that I have been diagnosed with COVID-19. At this time, I do not know how I contracted it. I will provide all of the information I can to public health and work with them to trace all of my contacts. 

I feel it is important to share that I am fully vaccinated and I continue to get tested regularly. I was tested last Thursday, November 11, and received a negative result. I started to feel unwell on Sunday and was tested again on Monday. This morning the test results came back positive. 

This shows how contagious this virus is and how important it is to be vaccinated and follow public health measures. I am not feeling well, but thankfully my symptoms are mild and I know that the vaccine is preventing me from becoming seriously ill.

I am worried about any friends, loved ones and constituents who I may have had contact with. But I also want this to be a reminder that COVID-19 is still with us and it is critical to continue to follow public health protocols. Get vaccinated. Stay home if you’re unwell and get tested. 

I will continue to work with public health and request privacy as I recover.

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","New Immigration Pathways for Hospitality Sector to Hire Skilled Workers","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--New Immigration Pathways for Hospitality Sector to Hire Skilled Workers
---------------------------------------------------
Business owners in the service industry are looking for support to help with labour shortages. The Province is making changes that will help employers hire international newcomers who have the skills they need.

Additions to the Occupations in Demand immigration stream include food counter attendants, kitchen helpers, related support occupations, food and beverage servers and light duty cleaners. Employers will have the option to hire these workers without the need for a labour market impact assessment before offering the position. There also won’t be a requirement for the employee to work with the employer for six months before applying to Nova Scotia’s Provincial Nominee Program.

“We’re excited to welcome newcomers who can help employers meet their labour needs and grow Nova Scotia’s population,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “The tourism, restaurant and hospitality sectors are critical to our economy. These changes will help these industries hire the workers they need to prepare for a busy tourism season.”

The Department continues to be innovative and responsive to current and emerging labour needs and is focused on and committed to working with businesses, across government, and with other stakeholders to ensure the Province has immigration programs that benefit employers, Nova Scotians and communities.

Quotes:
“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, members of the Restaurant Association of Nova Scotia have faced many challenges, including the ability to attract and retain workers. The government continues to respond with strong support through innovative options, and we’re incredibly pleased with these changes that will help us prepare for the upcoming holiday and tourism season. We look forward to seeing the impact of these new occupation additions and the relief it will bring to Nova Scotia’s restaurant industry as well as getting ready to welcome new Nova Scotians as our colleagues, neighbours and friends.”
     - Gordon Stewart, Executive Director, Restaurant Association of Nova Scotia

“Restaurants Canada believes this action to introduce new occupations under this immigration stream is a great option for employers in our sector to help fill their labour needs and hire more staff. This will sustain businesses and allow the industry to grow in communities throughout the province. Nine of 10 restaurateurs are reporting labour shortages and these measures will help. We’d like to thank the province for moving to address the needs of Nova Scotian business owners.”
     - Luc Erjavec, Vice-President, Atlantic Canada, Restaurants Canada

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia’s Occupations in Demand immigration stream targets specific national occupation codes – standardized national labour codes used to describe the work performed by Canadians – that are in high demand in Nova Scotia
-- the Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration identifies occupations in demand based on labour market information
-- three national occupation codes were added to the Occupations in Demand stream to allow these new options: NOC 671 – food counter attendants, kitchen helpers, related support occupations; NOC 6513 – food and beverage servers; and NOC 6731 – light duty cleaners
-- Nova Scotia’s population reached an all-time high of 992,055 as of July 1, largely due to increased immigration to the province

Aujourd'hui 16 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 31 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 41 rétablissements.

Il y a 19 cas dans le secteur du centre, 9 dans le secteur du nord, 2 dans le secteur de l'est et 1 dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Il y a transmission communautaire dans les secteurs du nord et de l'ouest, et elle est surtout liée à une transmission continue à la suite d'un rassemblement religieux qui a eu lieu à la fin d'octobre. Cela comprend une transmission secondaire à d'autres rassemblements religieux, dans des lieux de travail et au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash.

Un autre résident et deux autres membres du personnel du foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Un total de 29 résidents et 10 membres du personnel ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19. La Santé publique travaille avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 15 novembre, on a avisé cinq écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 16, Nova Scotia is reporting 31 new cases of COVID-19 and 41 recoveries.

There are 19 cases in Central Zone, nine cases in Northern Zone, two cases in Eastern Zone and one case in Western Zone.

There is community spread in Northern and Western zones, primarily related to ongoing transmission from a faith-based gathering that occurred in late October. This includes secondary transmission to other faith-based gatherings, workplaces and to East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in Pugwash.

One more resident and two additional staff members at East Cumberland Lodge have tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 29 residents and 10 staff members at the home have now tested positive. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On November 15, five schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 253 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 16 people are in hospital, including seven in ICU.

On November 15, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,893 tests.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 15 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale trois décès liés à la COVID-19. Deux de ces personnes, un octogénaire et une octogénaire, étaient résidentes du foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash. Également dans le secteur du nord, une femme dans la soixantaine est décédée. Elle n'était pas résidente d'un foyer de soins de longue durée. 

« Trop de personnes ont perdu la vie en raison de ce virus, et je suis de tout coeur avec les familles et les proches qui pleurent la perte d'un être cher, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Je suis bouleversé et inquiet que les éclosions actuelles entraînent des décès et une augmentation du nombre de personnes hospitalisées aux soins intensifs. Certaines personnes sont plus vulnérables à ce virus, même si elles sont vaccinées. Nous pouvons les protéger en nous faisant vacciner nous-mêmes. Si vous n'avez pas encore reçu le vaccin, il devrait s'agir d'une raison suffisante pour prendre les mesures nécessaires. »

Les deux décès liés au foyer de soins de longue durée seront inclus au tableau de bord des données sur la COVID-19 lorsqu'il sera mis à jour mardi.

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 99 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 109 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 12 novembre.

Il y a 52 cas dans le secteur du centre, 25 dans le secteur du nord, 21 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 1 dans le secteur de l'est.

Il y a transmission communautaire dans les secteurs du nord et de l'ouest, et elle est surtout liée à une transmission continue à la suite d'un rassemblement religieux qui a eu lieu à la fin d'octobre. Cela comprend une transmission secondaire à d'autres rassemblements religieux, dans des lieux de travail et au foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge.

Huit autres résidents et quatre autres membres du personnel du foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Un total de trente résidents et huit membres du personnel ont maintenant contracté la COVID-19. La Santé publique travaille avec l'établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

« Je transmets toutes mes condoléances aux familles des personnes décédées, déclare le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Le nombre de cas continue d'augmenter à la suite d'un rassemblement qui a eu lieu à la fin du mois d'octobre. Les responsables de la Santé publique font tout leur possible pour contenir la propagation, et nous nous attendons à une diminution du nombre de cas bientôt. Peu importe où vous êtes en Nouvelle-Écosse, respectez les mesures de santé publique, restez à la maison si vous êtes malade et faites-vous vacciner si ce n'est pas encore fait. »

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé onze écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 265 cas actifs de COVID-19. Seize personnes sont hospitalisées, dont sept aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 115 tests le 12 novembre, 2 464 tests le 13 novembre et 3 116 tests le 14 novembre.

Au 14 novembre, 1 595 200 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 773 294 étaient une deuxième dose, et 7 713 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 2 017 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 11 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 743. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 15, Nova Scotia is reporting three deaths related to COVID-19. Two people – a man and woman, both in their 80s – were residents of the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash. Also in Northern Zone, a woman in her 60s has died; she was not a resident of a long-term care home. 

“Too many Nova Scotians have lost their lives because of this virus and my heart goes out to the families and loved ones left behind,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I’m very upset and concerned that we now have deaths and climbing ICU numbers as a result of the current outbreaks. There are people who are more vulnerable to this virus even if they are vaccinated. We can protect them by being vaccinated ourselves. If you aren’t vaccinated this should be a good enough reason to take that step and get it done.”

The two deaths connected to the long-term care home will be reflected on the COVID-19 dashboard when it is updated Tuesday.

Nova Scotia is also reporting 99 new cases of COVID-19 and 109 recoveries since the last update November 12.

There are 52 cases in Central Zone, 25 cases in Northern Zone, 21 cases in Western Zone and one case in Eastern Zone.

There is community spread in Northern and Western zones, primarily related to ongoing transmission from a faith-based gathering that occurred in late October. This includes secondary transmission to other faith-based gatherings, workplaces and to East Cumberland Lodge.

A total of 30 residents and eight staff members at the home have now tested positive. Public and occupational health are working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the Nova Scotians who have passed away,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The case numbers continue to rise in connection with a gathering that took place at the end of October. Public health is working hard to contain the spread, and we expect to see declining cases soon. Regardless of where you live in Nova Scotia, please follow public health measures, stay home if you’re sick and if you haven’t done it yet, please get vaccinated.”

Over the past three days, 11 schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious.

"Public Works","New Country Harbour Ferry Officially Launches","PUBLIC WORKS--New Country Harbour Ferry Officially Launches
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new provincial ferry from Port Bickerton to Isaacs Harbour, Guysborough County, officially launched today, November 13, as the Theodore O’Hara, named in honour of the first lighthouse keeper in Port Bickerton.

A contest to name the new Country Harbour ferry was held last spring at St. Mary’s Education Centre/Academy. The successful submission was Theodore O’Hara, from Grade 2 student Alivia Mansfield. Mr. O’Hara kept the lighthouse from 1901 to 1931.

“A hats-off to the teachers and staff at St. Mary’s Education Centre/Academy for the amazing job hosting this contest,” said Greg Morrow, Minister of Agriculture and MLA for Guysborough-Tracadie, on behalf of Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “They creatively incorporated a ferry theme into their curriculum that included history, math, engineering, careers and the importance of the ferry in our community. The Theodore O’Hara will provide a safe and reliable service to our residents and travellers for many years.” 

Descendants of Mr. O’Hara were at today’s launch ceremony in Isaacs Harbour.

Quotes:
“A tradition dating back thousands of years, the seafaring community believes the name of a new vessel has a great role in bringing good fortune and safety to the vessel, its crew and passengers. As descendants of Theodore O’Hara, we are honoured to have our grandfather and great-grandfather’s name chosen for this fine Nova Scotia-built vessel.”
     - Claude O’Hara, great-grandson of Theodore O’Hara

“Providing shorter and reliable commutes to workers and emergency vehicles is paramount to the safety and prosperity of our communities. I am thrilled to see the legacy of Theodore O’Hara honoured in a way that provides a vital service in the region while creating jobs and enhancing public safety for decades to come.”
     - Mike Kelloway, Member of Parliament for Cape Breton-Canso, on behalf of Dominic Leblanc, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities

“We are very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be part of this experience. The activity for our students was an inclusive way to incorporate the history of the Country Harbour ferry into the outcomes they are learning in each of their classes. The staff has really embraced the opportunity and have tailored a variety of their lessons and activities around this inspiring initiative. I am proud of our students here at St. Mary's Education Centre/Academy for their efforts and commitment as the new ferry will now have a familiar meaning for them in the future. It is such an essential link to our neighboring communities.”
     - Mike MacIsaac, Principal, St. Mary’s Education Centre/Academy

Quick Facts:
-- the Country Harbour ferry provides an important transportation link on the Eastern Shore, as a connection point for many workers in the area and shorter routes for emergency vehicles
-- the Theodore O’Hara replaced the Stormont II, a 41-year-old, 12-car cable ferry
-- the new 15-car cable ferry cost about $6 million, with both the federal and provincial governments each funding about $3 million 
-- the new ferry will provide a reliable service for the next 35 to 40 years and have lower operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to November 28, 2021

REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 12 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce 70 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 69 cas résolus depuis la dernière mise à jour du 10 novembre.

Il y a 44 cas dans le secteur du centre, 12 dans le secteur du nord, 9 dans le secteur de l’ouest et 5 dans le secteur de l’est. 

Il y a transmission communautaire dans les secteurs du nord et de l’ouest, et elle est surtout liée à une transmission continue à la suite d’un rassemblement religieux qui a eu lieu à la fin d’octobre. Cela comprend une transmission secondaire à d’autres rassemblements religieux, dans des lieux de travail et au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash.

Deux autres résidents et deux autres employés au foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. En tout, 22 résidents et 4 employés du foyer de soins ont maintenant obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Au cours des deux derniers jours, on a avisé les responsables de sept écoles d’une ou de plusieurs expositions au virus au sein de leur établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Il y a eu 101 cas de COVID-19 dont l’épisode est survenu entre le 4 et le 9 novembre. De ce nombre :

-- 45 personnes (44,6 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 9 personnes (8,9 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 47 personnes (46,5 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

Il y a eu 6 067 cas du 15 mars au 9 novembre. De ce nombre :

-- 489 personnes (8,1 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 391 personnes (6,4 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 5 187 personnes (85,5 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 314 personnes ont été hospitalisées. De ce nombre :

-- 17 personnes (5,4 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 32 personnes (10,2 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 265 personnes (84,4 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 36 personnes sont décédées. De ce nombre :

-- 5 personnes (13,9 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (8,3 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 28 personnes (77,8 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 277 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix personnes sont hospitalisées, dont une aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 28 019 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 5 au 11 novembre. Cela comprend 2 114 tests de dépistage rapide dans les cliniques temporaires d’Halifax, de Dartmouth, d’Amherst et d’Annapolis Royal, et 25 905 tests de dépistage rapide administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. De plus, 11 558 tests rapides à faire à la maison ont été distribués dans les cliniques temporaires.

Le 10 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé 3 451 tests, et le 11 novembre, 2 552 tests.

Au 11 novembre, 1 593 242 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 772 138 étaient une deuxième dose, et 7 306 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 919 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 8 décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 634. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Le gouvernement provincial prolonge l’état d’urgence afin de protéger la santé et la sécurité des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et d’assurer la continuité des mesures de sécurité et d’autres mesures importantes. L’ordonnance prendra effet à midi le dimanche 14 novembre et sera en vigueur jusqu’à midi le dimanche 28 novembre, à moins que le gouvernement n’y mette fin ou la prolonge.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 28 novembre 2021.

Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, received his annual flu shot today, November 12, at Shopper’s Drug Mart in Fall River.

“It is important to get your annual flu vaccine,” said Dr. Strang. “Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and your family from the flu each year. Now that I got mine, it’s one less thing I have to worry about this winter.”

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia has ordered 495,200 doses of the flu shot this year
-- adults over 65, children six months to five years old, people who are pregnant, those residing in crowded living situations, people of any age who are residents of long-term care facilities and people with chronic illness are at a high risk of developing flu-related complications
-- people with flu symptoms should get tested for COVID-19 because the symptoms are similar for both illnesses

----------------------------------------------------------------
A special tree received a warm farewell today, November 12. The 60-year-old, 48-foot white spruce is a thank you gift to the people of Boston for their immediate medical aid and relief supplies following the Halifax Explosion of 1917.

“Nova Scotians will never forget those who were lost and injured as a result of the Halifax Explosion,” said Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Steve Craig on behalf of Premier Tim Houston. “This tradition has grown into a feeling of unity, hope and harmony for both Canadians and Americans of all ages. The way a tragedy can further unite us is something truly remarkable.”

This year marks the 104th anniversary of the Halifax Explosion and the 50th anniversary of the Tree for Boston tradition.

The Province is once again partnering with the Port of Halifax, PSA Halifax and Eimskip Canada to transport the tree on a container vessel. The tree will leave Halifax on November 15, reach Portland, Maine, on November 16, then arrive in Boston on November 17.

The live tree-lighting ceremony will take place on December 2 at 8 p.m. AST. Nova Scotia musicians Beòlach with Heather Rankin and R&B artist Keonté Beals will perform for more than 15,000 people on the Boston Common and an expected audience of 200,000 viewers on WCVB Channel 5 Boston.

Quotes:
“Eimskip is honoured to be a part of this great tradition again this year. The supply chain has been disrupted in many ways, however Eimskip has been able to service our customers and find new solutions to the demand. Supporting projects like the Tree for Boston is a very important part of our values, so we are happy to help in any way we can.”
     - Shawn Doyle, Sales & Operation Lead, Eimskip Canada

Quick Facts:
-- the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917, when the Norwegian vessel SS Imo collided with the SS Mont-Blanc, a French cargo ship laden with high explosives, in Halifax Harbour
-- 2,000 people were killed and 9,000 more were injured as a result of the explosion
-- this year’s tree was donated by landowner L’Arche Cape Breton, a non-profit organization that creates safe, supportive homes and meaningful work for people with disabilities

Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

----------------------------------------------------
A strong workplace safety culture in the province requires a knowledgeable leader to oversee the Workers’ Compensation Board of Nova Scotia (WCB) and its important work in injury prevention, support for workers and their families impacted by workplace injury and the safe return to work.

The Province announced today, November 10, that Dartmouth business leader Saeed El-Darahali is the WCB’s new Chair.

“Mr. El-Darahali has a wealth of experience, is a respected business and community leader and is well suited for this position,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “I want to congratulate Mr. El-Darahali on this appointment and thank the previous chair, Rodney Burgar, for all of his work.” 
	
Mr. El-Darahali is President and CEO of SimplyCast, a Dartmouth-based technology company. He has more than 15 years of leadership experience and was named one of Atlantic Canada’s top 50 CEOs in 2020 by Atlantic Business Magazine. Mr. El-Darahali is also a director of EduNova Cooperative Ltd. 
The appointment is for a five-year term with the possibility of reappointment.

Quotes:

"Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives / Natural Resources and Renewables","Changes Under Land Titles Clarification Act Will Help Resolve Claims Faster","EQUITY/ANTI-RACISM INITIATIVES/NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Changes Under Land Titles Clarification Act Will Help Resolve Claims Faster
------------------------------------------------------
The government is streamlining how some land claims are handled to help people in historic African Nova Scotian communities receive clear title to their property faster.

Effective today, November 10, the Minister responsible for the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives can issue certificates of claim and certificates of title under Part I of the Land Titles Clarification Act. This change reduces the number of departments involved in the process, so communities served by the Land Titles Initiative can receive quicker results.

“The Land Titles Initiative is righting a historic wrong, and we’re taking further action to make sure claims are resolved as efficiently as possible,” said Pat Dunn, Minister responsible for the office. “By dedicating more resources and authority to the Land Titles Initiative team, we can speed up helping people in African Nova Scotian communities gain the benefits of having clear title to their land.”

To support the change, land administration and surveyor resources will move to the office from the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables.

Quick Facts:
-- the Land Titles Initiative helps residents in North Preston, East Preston, Cherry Brook-Lake Loon, Lincolnville and Sunnyville gain clear title to their land
-- land titles can be cleared in three ways: through the Land Titles Clarification Act; the Probate Act, administered by the Department of Justice; or the Land Registration Act, administered by Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services
-- of 883 land parcels eligible to be cleared through the initiative, 252 have been completed and 275 files are active
-- there are 104 active files under the Land Titles Clarification Act stream

NOTE: The following is a statement from Premier Tim Houston 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Each year on November 11, we honour the courage and sacrifice of those who fought for our country in past conflicts and those who continue to serve, both at home and abroad.

Nova Scotia has a long and proud military history. Our military members are always there when we need them most.

Consider their sacrifices. Leaving home and loved ones to fight for freedom – to give hope – while knowing they could make the ultimate sacrifice. Many have not returned.

In Nova Scotia, we understand the dedication of members of the Canadian Forces very well. I know there are thousands of families like mine, who have a mom or dad or grandparent who bravely served our country, missing birthdays, Christmases, ballet recitals and hockey games – putting service before self. They are all heroes.

In my home, Dad was that hero. He served in the Air Force and I am proud of him and grateful for his service.

I encourage all Nova Scotians to take the time this Remembrance Day to pause to remember and reflect.

Our people serve proudly and defend our country’s values. We owe them all gratitude and respect. We have a responsibility to remember their sacrifices and ensure the freedoms they fought for are never taken for granted.

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","Veterans, Families to Save Money on Rent","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--Veterans, Families to Save Money on Rent
----------------------------------------------------------------
Veterans and families caring for a child with a severe mental or physical disability will soon save on their public housing rent costs.

The Province will now exclude the veterans’ disability pension and the child disability benefit when calculating how much rent someone will pay in public housing. 

This means someone receiving the veterans’ disability pension would see their public housing rent decrease by as much as $100 per month. A family receiving the child disability benefit could save about $60 per month.

“We are working hard to make housing more affordable, and this is one more thing we can do to help,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “I hope this change makes life a bit easier for our veterans, people with disabilities and their families.”

This change takes effect December 1. Staff will contact current tenants and rent-supplement clients to confirm whether they are eligible. Tenants can also call their local housing authority to discuss eligibility.

People who receive one of these two benefits, but don’t live in public housing, may also qualify if they are receiving a rent supplement from the Province. With this change, the Province may recalculate their income, resulting in a greater supplement. 

Quotes
“If you don’t have a lot of money, $100 a month is significant and can provide a measure of relief and comfort to the veteran and their family. This is a recognition that their service for their country is appreciated.”
     - Peter Kerr, National Association of Federal Retirees 

Quick Facts:
-- there are more than 17,000 Nova Scotians living in public housing units across the province
-- on average, public housing residents pay $456 a month rent
-- as of September 2021, the Province was providing over 4,000 rent supplements to Nova Scotians across the province; the average rent supplement is $327 per month
-- there are currently 35 people living in public housing who receive the veterans’ disability pension; complete statistics on how many people will benefit from this change are not available

----------------------------------------------------------------
Supportive housing programs help provide people with a home and a community while also addressing their unique, self-identified needs. The Province is providing about $2.7 million to Out of the Cold Community Association to deliver wraparound, supportive housing services to people staying in Halifax Regional Municipality’s (HRM’s) modular housing units.

“Finding solutions for something as complex as homelessness takes a collective approach, and we are pleased to partner with HRM on these units,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “Ensuring those experiencing homelessness have accessible, wraparound supports will help ensure they are set up for long-term success and on a path to permanent housing.”

Out of the Cold Community Association will provide services such as permanent housing solutions, mental health and addictions support, life stability and community connections, and employment support.

The association will also offer personalized case management and resident programming in a supportive, harm-reduction focused setting. This program will be offered to people who have been chronically homeless and are experiencing barriers to maintaining independent housing. Barriers could include poverty, criminalization, racism, homophobia, transphobia, food insecurity, inadequate access to physical and mental health supports, alcohol and substance use challenges and varying levels of ability and life skills.

Quotes:
“We are pleased to partner with the Province in the provision of a low-barrier, harm-reduction focused, supported housing model for 30 of our unhoused neighbours who experience high barriers to housing. This funding will allow us to offer 24/7 support within a professionally staffed model that offers stability and safety in a dignified space. Ultimately, this means 30 fewer people in our community are wondering where they will lay their head down at night, and we are grateful to be able to play a role in this with the Province’s financial support.”
     - Michelle Malette, Executive Director, Out of the Cold Community Association

Quick Facts:
-- as of November 9, according to the By-Name List maintained by the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia, there were 409 people in HRM experiencing homelessness
-- the funding to Out of the Cold is part of the $10.1 million announced by the Department in October to help those experiencing homelessness
-- in May, investments were made to provide permanent supportive housing options that will offer wraparound services for homeless people with complex needs and significant barriers to securing permanent housing
-- the provincial Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness was launched in February 2020 in an effort to address some of these issues

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 9 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Un octogénaire est mort dans le secteur de l'est.

« Cela me fait beaucoup de peine de savoir qu’une autre famille pleure la perte d’un être cher à cause de la COVID-19, a déclaré le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous devons tous jouer notre rôle et nous faire vacciner, et nous devons suivre les consignes sanitaires. Si nous sommes malades, nous restons à la maison. Si nous ne sommes pas vaccinés, nous respectons la politique sur la preuve de vaccination et nous ne participons pas à des activités qui ne sont pas essentielles. C’est de cette manière que nous nous protégeons les uns les autres. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également 56 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 29 cas résolus.

Il y a 30 cas dans le secteur de l’ouest, 18 dans le secteur du centre, 7 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'est. 

Il y a transmission communautaire dans les secteurs du nord et de l’ouest, et elle est surtout liée à une transmission continue à la suite d’un rassemblement religieux qui a eu lieu à la fin d’octobre. Cela comprend une transmission secondaire à d’autres rassemblements religieux, dans des lieux de travail et au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash.

Treize nouveaux résidents et un nouvel employé au foyer de soins East Cumberland Lodge ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Certains de ces cas figureront dans les statistiques de mercredi. En tout, 17 résidents et 2 employés du foyer de soins ont maintenant obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage et un résident est hospitalisé. La Santé publique travaille avec l’établissement pour que le virus ne se propage pas davantage. Des restrictions et des mesures sanitaires accrues ont été imposées.

Le 8 novembre, on a avisé quatre écoles qu'il y a eu exposition au virus dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures.  

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 281 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 10 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 2 aux soins intensifs.

Le 8 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 666 tests.

Au 8 novembre, 1 588 158 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 769 498 sont une deuxième dose, et 5 848 sont une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 821 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 8 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 532. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 14 novembre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 9, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 80s in Eastern Zone has died.

“It pains me greatly to know that another family is mourning the loss of a loved one because of COVID-19,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We all need to do our part and get vaccinated, and we need to follow the rules. If we’re sick, we stay home. If we aren’t vaccinated, we respect the proof of vaccine policy and we don’t participate in activities that aren’t essential. This is how we protect ourselves and one another.”

Nova Scotia is also reporting 56 new cases of COVID-19 and 29 recoveries.

There are 30 cases in Western Zone, 18 cases in Central Zone, seven cases in Northern Zone and one case in Eastern Zone. 

There is community spread in Northern and Western zones, primarily related to ongoing transmission from a faith-based gathering that occurred in late October. This includes secondary transmission to other faith-based gatherings, workplaces and to East Cumberland Lodge, a long-term care home in Pugwash.

Thirteen more residents and one additional staff member at East Cumberland Lodge have tested positive for COVID-19. Some of these cases will be reflected in Wednesday’s case numbers. A total of 17 residents and two staff members at the home have now tested positive, and one resident is in hospital. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

On November 8, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 281 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 10 people are in hospital, including two in ICU.

On November 8, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,666 tests.

As of November 8, 1,588,158 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 769,498 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 5,848 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 1,821 positive COVID-19 cases and eight deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 1,532 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians can learn more about the experiences of Mi’kmaw communities through a new exhibit, featuring Mi’kmaw historian and guest curator Salina Kemp, at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax.

Ta’n me’j Tel-keknuo’ltiek, which translates to ‘how unique we still are,’ reflects the many ways Mi’kmaw people are connected to the lands, and especially the waters, of Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral territory of the Mi’kmaq. 

“The exhibit offers insights into the range and diversity of Mi’kmaw people’s lived experiences,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “The Mi’kmaq are Nova Scotia’s first people. I encourage everyone to visit the new exhibit to better understand both the historical and contemporary experiences of Mi’kmaw communities.”

The exhibit was developed as part of the Nova Scotia Museum’s contribution to the 2023 North American Indigenous Games.

Ta’n me’j Tel-keknuo’ltiek opens to the public today, November 9. For more information, visit https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/  

Quotes:
“Having a place where people from all over the province and even around the world can share in Mi’kmaw culture, experiences and history is very exciting. Ta’n me’j Tel-keknuo’ltiek provides a great opportunity for us all to learn about the strong connection Mi’kmaq have to the land. Congratulations to staff and everyone who made the exhibit possible. I am excited for the teaching and learning that will happen at the museum over the coming weeks.”
     - Karla MacFarlane, Minister of L’nu Affairs

“As a Mi’kmaw woman who has grown up in Kjipuktuk (Halifax), it is an honour to have the opportunity to educate people on the many ways that the Mi’kmaq continue to be unique, even after more than 300 years of resistance to attempted erasure and assimilation. It is my hope that this exhibit will provide Mi'kmaw youth with a sense of cultural pride and provide Canadians with education about our treaty relationship and continuing presence.""
     - Salina Kemp, Mi’kmaw historian and guest curator

Quick Facts:
-- the exhibit uses single word concepts from the Mi'kmaw language to provide cultural context for the individual lived experiences of the participants
-- Mi'kmaw people have been evolving and adapting to their environment and the tools available to them for more than 13,000 years
-- North American sport and recreation is rooted in the land and uses items created by Indigenous people

Two provincial programs will help municipalities create beautiful, inviting spaces and provide opportunities for individuals to work within their communities.

Through the Beautification and Streetscaping Program, 28 projects will share a total of $582,592 to enhance the beauty of communities and attract more visitors to local areas.

Nine projects will receive $164,083 through the Community Works Program. The program creates job opportunities for youth and unemployed people to gain skills and experience in their fields.

“Investing in beautification projects helps make our communities more vibrant, fosters local pride and encourages economic development,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr. “The Community Works Program allows municipalities to hire people to work on community-focused projects, such as municipal planning, accessibility or landscaping projects.”

Quotes:
“This funding will be a great help in developing new green space in the Town of Port Hawkesbury through the creation of Sunset Park. This park will enable us to achieve another step forward in waterfront development by helping beautify Granville Street and creating an attraction for people to enjoy.”
     - Brenda Chisholm Beaton, Mayor, Town of Port Hawkesbury

“We are pleased with today’s announcement. This funding will help us advance social inclusion for differently abled people in our rural communities, a priority for our region. We anticipate a lot of work, but it is work we are prepared to do and are anxious to begin.”
     - Allen Webber, Warden, Municipality of Chester

Quick Facts:
-- both programs are application-based
-- both programs fund up to 50 per cent of the costs of eligible municipal projects to a maximum of $25,000

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s provincial parks are wrapping up another busy and successful season, welcoming more than one million visitors to camping and day-use parks and a record number of campers to provincial campgrounds.

Provincial campgrounds logged 91,262 overnight stays, which represents a 13 per cent increase over the shorter camping season in 2020. About 86 per cent of campers came from Nova Scotia and 13 per cent were from other parts of Canada. About one per cent came from the United States.

Public health directives remained in place to ensure campers and visitors could enjoy and explore the parks safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Nova Scotians and others value provincial parks and the many ways they enable us to enjoy the social, mental and physical health benefits of being in nature,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “We will continue improving the visitor experience and making sure programs and services are more accessible to everyone.”

Infrastructure improvements made this year include: 
-- a mobility accessible, gender-neutral washroom facility at The Islands Provincial Park in Shelburne County 
-- a mobility accessible park office with a gender-neutral washroom at Blomidon Provincial Park in Kings County
-- accessible campsites at Amherst Shore Provincial Park in Cumberland County.

Water and electrical services were added to several campsites at Caribou-Munroes Island Provincial Park in Pictou County and a new looped trail system was completed at Cape Split Provincial Park in Kings County.

All provincial parks, beaches and campgrounds are now closed for the season. Parks are accessible but there is no access to washrooms or garbage receptacles. Visitors are encouraged to keep spaces clean and safe for everyone by not leaving any garbage or waste behind.

Quick Facts:
-- there are 20 camping parks and 109 day-use and beach parks in Nova Scotia

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","111 New Cases of COVID-19, 76 Recoveries, Outbreak at Long-term Care Home","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--111 New Cases of COVID-19, 76 Recoveries, Outbreak at Long-term Care Home
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, November 8, Nova Scotia is reporting 111 new cases of COVID-19 and 76 recoveries since the last update on November 5.

There are 52 cases in Western Zone, 31 cases in Central Zone, 19 cases in Northern Zone and nine cases in Eastern Zone. 

The increase in case numbers is related to ongoing community spread in Amherst and Cumberland County, as well as ongoing transmission from a faith-based gathering. This includes secondary transmission to other faith-based gatherings, workplaces and to East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash. 

The Province is reporting an outbreak at this facility. Four residents and one staff member have tested positive for COVID-19. One resident is in hospital. Public health is working with the facility to prevent further spread. Increased public health measures and restrictions are in place.

Over the past three days, five schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 255 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, nine people are in hospital, including one in ICU.

Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,379 tests on November 5; 3,302 tests on November 6; and 2,068 tests on November 7.

As of November 7, 1,586,285 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 768,658 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 5,182 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 1,765 positive COVID-19 cases and seven deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 1,503 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to November 14, 2021

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","111 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 76 rétablissements, éclosion dans un foyer de soins de longue durée","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--111 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 76 rétablissements, éclosion dans un foyer de soins de longue durée
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 8 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 111 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 76 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 5 novembre.

Il y a 52 cas dans le secteur de l'ouest, 31 dans le secteur du centre, 19 dans le secteur du nord et 9 dans le secteur de l'est. 

L'augmentation du nombre de cas est liée à la transmission communautaire continue dans la région d'Amherst et du comté de Cumberland, ainsi qu'à la transmission continue à la suite d'un rassemblement religieux. Il y a maintenant transmission secondaire dans d'autres rassemblements religieux, dans des bureaux et au foyer de soins de longue durée East Cumberland Lodge à Pugwash. 

Le gouvernement provincial signale une éclosion dans cet établissement. Quatre résidents et un membre du personnel ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Un résident est hospitalisé. La Santé publique collabore avec l'établissement pour freiner la transmission. Des mesures et des restrictions plus vigoureuses en matière de santé publique sont en vigueur.

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé cinq écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 255 cas actifs de COVID-19. Neuf personnes sont hospitalisées, dont une aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 379 tests le 5 novembre, 3 302 tests le 6 novembre et 2 068 tests le 7 novembre.

Au 7 novembre, 1 586 285 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 768 658 étaient une deuxième dose, et 5 182 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 765 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 7 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 503. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 14 novembre 2021.

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Old-Growth Forest Policy Open for Public Input","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Old-Growth Forest Policy Open for Public Input
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is updating the policy that protects old-growth forests on Crown land and is seeking public feedback.

The current policy has been in place since 2012. The revised draft policy incorporates advancements in technology and research over the past decade.

“Old-growth forests are an important part of the province’s biodiversity and must be maintained and protected,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “Crown land belongs to all of us. We’ve heard from stakeholder groups about the draft policy, and now we want to give the public the chance to provide their feedback as we look to change the way Crown land is managed in this province.”

The draft policy can be found here: https://novascotia.ca/old-forest-policy-consultation/ . Written submissions will be accepted until December 8.

Old-growth forests will be included in the conservation zone of the ecological forestry triad model, as recommended in Prof. William Lahey’s report on forestry practices in Nova Scotia.

Once finalized, the new policy will be incorporated into the department’s process to review and approve harvest applications.

Quick Facts:
-- once a forest stand is designated as old growth, restrictions apply to the type of harvesting and activity that can be done in the area
-- the new Old-Growth Forest Policy draft contains a provision for review every five years 
-- the draft policy was developed following targeted stakeholder consultations 
-- the policy only applies to Crown land, though its principles can be applied to private land

------------------------------------------------------
During the fall sitting of the legislature, the government passed important legislation, advanced new policy solutions and participated in respectful debate, setting the stage for a healthy Nova Scotia.

The sitting, which included the return of full in-person attendance, wrapped up today, November 5.

As committed in the throne speech, amendments to the Elections Act were passed that will, for the first time in Nova Scotia, establish fixed dates for provincial general elections.

The Province is taking action to improve access to affordable housing across Nova Scotia with funding for new programs and services. Five separate pieces of related legislation were also passed: the Interim Residential Rental Increase Cap Act, Residential Tenancies Act (amended), Joint Regional Transportation Agency Act, Housing in the Halifax Regional Municipality Act and a bill with amendments to the Municipal Government Act and Halifax Regional Municipality Charter.

Ambitious environmental legislation, with targets and a strong focus on equity and inclusion, was also passed, continuing Nova Scotia’s leadership in environmental sustainability. The Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act includes the strongest 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target in Canada and sets the path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

“As a new government, we have jumped in quickly and are moving forward on initiatives that matter to Nova Scotians, like healthcare recruitment, long-term care, mental healthcare, affordable housing, the environment and the economy,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I am proud of our team in what we have accomplished so far, and I am thankful to all members of the house for the open and thoughtful discussions we had on equity, systemic racism and finding solutions to better serve marginalized Nova Scotians. This raises the bar for our democracy, and I look forward to even more cooperation.”

During the session, Premier Houston announced in a ministerial statement that all nurses graduating from Nova Scotia’s universities and Nova Scotia Community College for the next five years will be offered a job in the province.

Premier Houston also tabled the third and final report of the Reflection and Action Task Group in the legislature in response to the Restorative Inquiry into the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. It outlines the government's progress in addressing barriers and systemic racism and in finding solutions centred around the needs of the people it serves.

Among other legislation passed:
-- amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act to help improve road safety
-- amendments to the Cannabis Control Act to clarify the standard of reasonableness required to search a place or vehicle
-- amendments to the Fisheries and Coastal Resources Act to support Nova Scotia Aquaculture Review Board operations
-- amendments to the Justice Act to allow the Serious Incident Response Team to conduct investigations or provide oversight of policing in another province
-- new legislation to protect patients, health-service providers and staff of healthcare facilities from protests by establishing a 50-metre bubble area
-- legislation to transition Tourism Nova Scotia from a Crown corporation to a division of the Department of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage.

The government has also announced it is working on legislation for next spring:

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","La Province adopte les recommandations nationales sur la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--La Province adopte les recommandations nationales sur la dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 
----------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse commencera à administrer une dose de rappel du vaccin contre la COVID-19 à un plus grand nombre de groupes admissibles, et ce, d’ici la fin de novembre.

La Province acceptera les cinq recommandations du Comité consultatif national de l’immunisation (CCNI) annoncées le 29 octobre. Les recommandations suggèrent notamment de proposer une dose de rappel aux personnes présentant un risque plus élevé d’une maladie sévère due à la COVID-19 ou d’une baisse de protection après une série vaccinale primaire.

« Nous nous préparons à offrir une dose de rappel du vaccin, mais notre priorité sera toujours d’encourager les personnes qui n’ont reçu qu’une seule dose à se prévaloir de la deuxième dose, et les personnes qui ne sont pas vaccinées contre la COVID-19 à se faire vacciner, a déclaré le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La dose de rappel pourrait offrir un degré de protection accru, mais le meilleur moyen de réduire la propagation du virus est de voir à ce que chacun ait au moins les deux doses du vaccin. »

Le CCNI recommande d’offrir la dose de rappel au moins six mois après l’achèvement de la série vaccinale primaire. Les groupes qui seront admissibles à la dose de rappel en Nouvelle-Écosse sont :
-- les personnes de 80 ans et plus, puis celles de 70 à 79;
-- les travailleurs de la santé de première ligne qui sont entièrement vaccinés, mais dont l’intervalle de vaccination entre les deux doses est de moins de 28 jours;
-- les personnes qui ont reçu deux doses du vaccin Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD d’AstraZeneca ou une dose du vaccin de Janssen. 

La Province travaille également avec les communautés autochtones et afro-néo-écossaises pour déterminer le meilleur moyen d’offrir la dose de rappel à ces groupes.

La planification est déjà entamée pour l’administration de la dose de rappel et le système de prise de rendez-vous en ligne est en train d’être mis à jour. De plus amples renseignements seront fournis une fois que la prise de rendez-vous pourra commencer pour la dose de rappel.

Le CCNI a aussi recommandé le mois dernier que l’intervalle optimal entre la première et la deuxième dose soit de huit semaines. Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse peuvent toujours recevoir leur deuxième dose 28 jours après la première, mais ils sont encouragés à suivre la recommandation du CCNI et à attendre huit semaines avant de recevoir leur deuxième dose.

Faits en bref
-- La Province a commencé à offrir dès le 25 octobre la dose de rappel pour les gens qui vivent dans des établissements de soins de longue durée et d’autres lieux d’hébergement en commun qui fournissent des soins aux personnes âgées.
-- La dose de rappel a été offerte dès le 4 octobre aux personnes atteintes d’une déficience immunitaire moyenne ou grave et aux personnes qui prennent des médicaments qui affaiblissent considérablement leur système immunitaire. 
-- Les personnes qui, dans le cadre de leur travail, doivent se rendre dans un pays qui ne reconnaît pas la combinaison de deux vaccins pourraient être admissibles à une troisième dose pour leur permettre de remplir les conditions d’entrée ou pour éviter l’isolement à l’arrivée dans ce pays.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Province Adopts National Recommendations on COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Province Adopts National Recommendations on COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters
-----------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia will begin to administer COVID-19 booster doses to more eligible groups by the end of November.

The Province will accept all five recommendations announced on October 29 by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). This includes offering boosters to people with a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness or decreased protection since vaccination.

“As we prepare to offer booster doses, our first priority will continue to be encouraging people who have one or no doses of COVID vaccine to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Boosters may provide an added level of protection, but the best way to reduce the spread of the virus is to ensure that everyone has at least two doses of vaccine.”

NACI recommended that booster doses be offered at least six months after the primary series is completed. Groups who will be eligible for a booster dose in Nova Scotia include:
-- anyone 80 and older, followed by anyone ages 70 to 79
-- adult frontline healthcare workers who were double vaccinated with an interval of less than 28 days between their first and second doses
-- people who received two doses of the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD vaccine or one dose of Janssen vaccine

The Province is also engaging with Indigenous and African Nova Scotian communities on the best way to offer booster doses in those communities.

Planning for the booster doses is underway, and updates to the vaccine booking system are being made. More information will be announced once booking for booster doses opens.

NACI also recommended last month that the optimal interval between first and second doses is eight weeks. Nova Scotians can still schedule their second dose as early as 28 days after the first but are encouraged to follow the NACI recommendation and wait eight weeks for their second dose.

Quick Facts:
-- booster doses for people living in long-term care and other congregate settings that provide care for seniors became available October 25
-- third doses for moderately to severely immunocompromised people or people who are taking medications that substantially suppress their immune system became available October 4
-- people who are required to travel for work to a country that does not recognize a mixed vaccine series may be eligible for a third dose to meet entry requirements or to avoid isolation

Aujourd'hui 5 novembre, le gouvernement provincial publie des données initiales sur le taux de vaccination des travailleurs des secteurs de la santé, des soins de longue durée, de l'éducation et des services de santé d'urgence.

Les employeurs doivent recueillir et signaler les taux de vaccination dans le cadre de la politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 annoncée le 29 septembre.

Selon la politique, tous les employés doivent avoir reçu au moins une première dose du vaccin avant le 30 novembre et sont tenus de présenter une preuve de vaccination complète 70 jours après leur première dose. Les personnes partiellement vaccinées pourront devoir faire l'objet d'autres mesures de sécurité, y compris le test de dépistage. Les employés qui n'auront pas reçu leur première dose au 30 novembre seront mis en congé administratif non rémunéré. 

En date du 4 novembre, entre 50 et 90 % des employés des secteurs clés ont présenté leur preuve de vaccination, et la plupart sont entièrement vaccinés :
-- Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse : 91 %
-- IWK Health Centre : 99  %
-- Soins de longue durée : 93 %
-- Soins à domicile : 89 %
-- Éducation : 97 %
-- Services de santé d'urgence : 99 %

« Les taux de vaccination sont encourageants jusqu'à présent, et je remercie tous les employés qui ont reçu le vaccin et qui font le nécessaire pour protéger contre la COVID-19 les personnes vulnérables avec qui elles travaillent, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Il s'agit d'une mesure sérieuse, mais la situation est sérieuse et nous devons prendre au sérieux notre responsabilité de protéger les autres. Si vous n'avez pas encore reçu le vaccin, je vous encourage à le faire. » 

La collecte des données se poursuit. Au cours des prochaines semaines, les employeurs communiqueront avec les employés qui n'ont pas encore présenté leur preuve de vaccination ou leur intention de se faire vacciner.

Les employés qui n'ont pas présenté leur preuve de vaccination ou qui ont indiqué ne pas avoir l'intention de se faire vacciner doivent suivre un programme d'éducation obligatoire. 

La politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 s'applique à plus de 80 000 employés, y compris aux groupes suivants :
-- Membres du personnel de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse et du IWK Health Centre
-- Employés des établissements de soins de longue durée (agréés ou non agréés) et des organismes de soins à domicile (financés par des fonds publics et privés)
-- Enseignants des écoles publiques, employés de la prématernelle et autres membres du personnel scolaire, employés des centres régionaux pour l'éducation et du Conseil scolaire acadien provincial et employés qui fournissent des services dans les écoles, notamment les employés de la cafétéria et les conducteurs d'autobus scolaires
-- Éducateurs et éducatrices de la petite enfance et personnel des établissements agréés de garde d'enfants, bénévoles, stagiaires et autres professionnels qui sont présents dans ces établissements
-- Employés des Centres de traitement des troubles de l'audition et du langage de la Nouvelle-Écosse

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Update on Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare, Education, Other Sectors","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Update on Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare, Education, Other Sectors
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is releasing initial data on the vaccination rates of workers in healthcare, long-term care, education and emergency health services today, November 5.

Employers are required to collect and report vaccination rates as part of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate announced September 29.

Under the mandate, all employees are required to have at least a first dose of vaccine by November 30, with a requirement to show proof of full vaccination 70 days after their first dose. Those who are partially vaccinated may be subjected to other health and safety measures, including testing. Those who do not have a first dose by November 30 will be placed on unpaid administrative leave. 

As of November 4, between 50 and 90 per cent of employees in key sectors have provided proof of vaccination. Of those who responded, most are fully vaccinated:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority: 91 per cent
-- IWK Health Centre: 99 per cent
-- Long-term care: 93 per cent
-- Home care: 89 per cent
-- Education: 97 per cent
-- Emergency Health Services: 99 per cent

“I’m encouraged by the rates so far and I want to thank all of the employees who are  vaccinated and doing their part to keep the vulnerable people they work with safe from COVID-19,” said Premier Tim Houston. “This mandate is serious, but these are serious times and we have to take our responsibility to protect others seriously. If you haven’t been vaccinated yet, I encourage you to make the right choice.” 

Data collection continues. Over the next couple of weeks, employers will be following up with employees who have not yet reported their status or their intention to be vaccinated.

Employees who have not yet reported, or who have said they do not intend to be vaccinated, must complete a mandatory educational program. 

The COVID-19 vaccine mandate covers more than 80,000 employees. The following groups are included:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre
-- workers in long-term care facilities (licensed and unlicensed) and home-care agencies (publicly and privately funded)
-- public school teachers, pre-primary and other school-based staff, regional and board office staff, and those providing services in schools, including cafeteria and school bus services
-- early childhood educators and staff in regulated child care, as well as any volunteers, practicum students, or other professionals entering these settings
-- Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia
-- workers in residential facilities and day programs funded by the Department of Community Services Disability Support Program and adult day programs funded by Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care
-- workers in Department of Community Services facilities and those providing placements for children and youth in the care of the Minister of Community Services (excluding foster family placements)
-- paramedics, LifeFlight nurses and some other staff at EHS
-- physicians and other service providers to the above organizations; for example hairdressers and contractors
-- correctional officers, youth workers, volunteers, visitors, contractors and service providers who work in, or provide service to adult or youth correctional facilities.

Quick Facts: 
-- about 79 per cent of Nova Scotians are fully vaccinated

REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 5 novembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 40 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 31 rétablissements.

Il y a 21 cas dans le secteur du centre, 11 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 8 dans le secteur du nord. L'équipe de santé publique de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse mène une enquête sur ces nouveaux cas afin de mieux comprendre les circonstances entourant cette augmentation du nombre du cas.

Le 4 novembre, on a avisé deux écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Il y a eu 110 cas de COVID-19 dont l'épisode est survenu entre le 28 octobre et le 3 novembre. De ce nombre : 

-- 34 personnes (30,9 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 7 personnes (6,4 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 69 personnes (62,7 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

Il y a eu 5 833 cas du 15 mars au 3 novembre. De ce nombre :

-- 406 personnes (7 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 371 personnes (6,3 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 5 056 personnes (86,7 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 308 personnes ont été hospitalisées. De ce nombre :

-- 14 personnes (4,5 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 31 personnes (10,1 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 263 personnes (85,4 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 35 personnes sont décédées. De ce nombre :

-- 4 personnes (11,4 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (8,6 %) n'avaient reçu qu'une seule dose;
-- 28 personnes (80 %) n'étaient pas vaccinées.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 220 cas actifs de COVID-19. Neuf personnes sont hospitalisées, dont une aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 28 608 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 29 octobre au 4 novembre. Cela comprend 1 488 tests de dépistage rapide dans les cliniques temporaires d'Halifax, de Dartmouth, d'Amherst et de Kentville, et 27 120 tests de dépistage rapide administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. De plus, 8 661 tests rapides à faire à la maison ont été distribués dans les cliniques temporaires.

Le 4 novembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé 3 204 tests.

Au 4 novembre, 1 583 479 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 767 200 étaient une deuxième dose, et 4 586 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 654 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 7 décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 427. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 14 novembre 2021.

Today, November 5, Nova Scotia is reporting 40 new cases of COVID-19 and 31 recoveries.

There are 21 cases in Central Zone, 11 cases in Western Zone and eight cases in Northern Zone. Nova Scotia Health Authority’s (NSHA’s) public health team is investigating these new cases to understand the circumstances around the increased numbers.

On November 4, two schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

There have been 110 cases of COVID-19 with an episode date between October 28 and November 3. Of those:

-- 34 (30.9 per cent) were fully vaccinated

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to November 14, 2021

"Premier's Office","Province Closes Student Assistance Gap for Dalhousie University Nursing Students","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Province Closes Student Assistance Gap for Dalhousie University Nursing Students
---------------------------------------------------
Eligible Dalhousie University nursing students will have immediate access to additional student assistance funding to help cover costs for the entire duration of their program.

Currently, students in Dalhousie’s accelerated nursing program qualify for funding to cover only 28 weeks of their 34-week program. Students have said the funding gap is one of the main hardships in completing their training.

“We need more nurses, and we need those already here to study and stay in Nova Scotia,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I want our nursing students to know we are listening to their concerns. We’re addressing barriers to completing their studies and giving them the support they need to build a guaranteed and successful career right here at home.”

This change will take effect immediately. The amount of assistance for which students qualify will be based on their need, and assessments of all 250 students will begin today, November 5. The assessments are automatic – students do not need to apply or call the student assistance program.

Students are expected to receive additional funds based on their assessed need within two weeks.

The funding shortfall is unique to the Dalhousie nursing program because of the length of the program. Cape Breton University and St. Francis Xavier University nursing students currently have access to student assistance for the entire duration of their programs.

Eligible post-secondary students, including nursing students, can have up to 100 per cent of their Nova Scotia student loan automatically forgiven after graduation.

Quotes:
“This is fantastic news for all Dalhousie nursing students, especially as many students have been struggling because of this gap in funding. I would like to thank the Premier and Minister of Health and Wellness for their quick actions in addressing nursing students’ concerns. The ability to have student loans assessed for the correct number of weeks will help ease our stress around tuition, food and rent. Moreover, it will allow for us to concentrate on finishing our studies and giving back to our community through service. It is a great relief to know that nursing students' voices are heard and turned into concrete actions as we continue to be integral parts of the healthcare continuum and our community.”
     - Anika Daclan, Atlantic Regional Director of Canadian Nursing Students’ Association and Co-President of the Dalhousie University Nursing Society

“Nurses are a critical part of our healthcare system, and we are fortunate to have such dedicated and talented nursing students studying in our post-secondary institutions. I am pleased our staff could act quickly to close this funding gap, and I will continue to listen to students to hear their ideas and address their concerns.”
     - Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education

Quick Facts:
-- the average increase in assistance for the Dalhousie students is expected to be about $3,300; the amount per student will vary
-- this assistance will be available for current and future Dalhousie nursing students in the accelerated program
-- approximately 700 nurses graduate every year from Nova Scotia post-secondary institutions

Today, November 4, Nova Scotia is reporting 50 new cases of COVID-19 and 17 recoveries.

There are 20 cases in Western Zone, 20 cases in Northern Zone, eight cases in Central Zone and two cases in Eastern Zone. Nova Scotia Health Authority’s (NSHA’s) public health team is investigating these new cases to understand the circumstances around the increased numbers.

On November 3, two schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 213 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, nine people are in hospital, including one in ICU.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement).

"Premier's Office","Government Advances Work of Restorative Inquiry, Commits to Youth Commission","PREMIER’S OFFICE--Government Advances Work of Restorative Inquiry, Commits to Youth Commission
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A statement by Premier Tim Houston, read in the House of Assembly today, November 4, follows the release
----------------------------------------------------------------
The learnings from the Restorative Inquiry into the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children will have a positive and long-lasting impact by shaping important changes in how the government serves the needs of Nova Scotians.

Premier Tim Houston tabled the third and final report of the Reflection and Action Task Group in the legislature today, November 4. It outlines the government’s progress in addressing barriers and working to find solutions centred around people’s needs.

“We want to make a positive difference in the lives of children, young people, families and communities and the inquiry’s final report gave the government a road map for real change,” said Premier Houston. “We are looking at our systems and institutions, reflecting on the impacts of systemic racism and working with communities. There is still more work to do, and more for us to learn. I am committed to listening and doing everything in my power to finding a different way forward together.”

The Premier also committed to creating a Children and Youth Commission to protect and advance the rights, interests and viewpoints of children and youth in Nova Scotia, which fulfills another recommendation of the Restorative Inquiry. 

The commission will take a restorative approach, working with children and youth, families and the entire care system. It will be designed over the coming months by government and community partners, with related legislation being introduced in the spring of 2022.

The Reflection and Action Task Group report highlighted several initiatives that are using human-centred and restorative approaches, with the Province’s response to COVID-19 as a recent example. 

When needs arose in African Nova Scotian communities, multiple government departments worked alongside organizations like the Health Association of African Canadians, the Association of Black Social Workers and the African United Baptist Association to provide services and support where people needed them most. Vaccine clinics were mobilized in African Nova Scotian and Indigenous communities, with community organizers helping to lead the way. 

Other examples include: 
-- the Department of Community Services has formed an Africentric Child Welfare Team to better serve the needs of children, youth, and families of African descent 
-- an African Nova Scotian youth employment social innovation lab is bringing multiple departments together to help close the employment gap for Black youth
-- the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives is leading a government-wide approach to address systemic racism and achieve more equitable outcomes in health, education and the economy
-- the Province is investing in an African Nova Scotian Justice Institute, to be led by the African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition, that will support African Nova Scotians in contact with the law and help address overrepresentation and anti-Black racism in the justice system
-- as the government implements the Adoptions Record Act, it will balance access to information and privacy for those who request it in a respectful, trauma-informed and culturally respectful way.

Quotes: 
“Although the Child and Youth Advocate model is one which exists in other places, the Restorative Inquiry recommendation offered an alternative – one which would incorporate a more human-centred approach to supporting and bringing forward the voice of children and youth. This model, which we will develop with communities over the coming months, will be unique to Nova Scotia and will serve the young people in our province.”
     - Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services

Quick Facts:
-- the Reflection and Action Task Group, made up of representatives from the Restorative Inquiry’s Council of Parties and deputy ministers from several government departments, was mandated to report on actions in advancing the recommendations of the Restorative Inquiry
-- the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children operated from 1921 to 2015, initially as an institution for Black children who were not welcome in mainstream orphanages; residents experienced neglect, emotional, physical and sexual abuse
-- the inquiry was established following the settlement of a class action lawsuit by former residents, which also took a restorative approach to the settlement; the restorative inquiry was established under the Public Inquiries Act and began work in 2015 
-- the inquiry was established following an apology from the Nova Scotia Government to former residents and the African Nova Scotian community in 2014 for the harmful impacts of systemic racism
-- the inquiry focused on three central issues: responses to institutionalized abuse, experiences of children and youth in care and impacts of systemic racism on African Nova Scotians; its final report was released in November 2019

Premier’s statement:

Moments ago, I tabled the final report to the legislature from the Reflection and Action Task Group, outlining how the government has continued the work of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children Restorative Inquiry.  

Mr. Speaker, as all members of this House would know, the Restorative Inquiry is one of the most important pieces of work this Province has ever undertaken. I want to credit the previous government for launching the Inquiry – it was done with strong support and participation from all parties, and I am honoured to stand as Premier and speak to the final report today.

The Restorative Inquiry was a call to examine some of the most difficult and painful parts of our past, to learn from them and do better.

The former residents of the Home really modeled for us how to do this work. They made it clear that the goal was not to name or punish individual bad actors, but to look at our systems and institutions, to reflect on the impacts of systemic racism, and to find a different way forward together.

This report outlines how government has begun to do that work, and how government will continue in the future.

Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear, as the Restorative Inquiry was clear – this is not just a matter of adding new programs or services. It’s about changing how we work, to put people and human needs at the centre of all we do.

Government is taking steps to address barriers. The learnings from the Restorative Inquiry have shaped many positive changes within government.

The Department of Community Services has formed an Africentric Child Welfare Team to better serve the needs of children, youth, and families of African descent.

An African Nova Scotian youth employment social innovation lab is bringing multiple departments together to help close the employment gap for Black youth.

And the Office of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives is leading a whole-of-government approach to address systemic racism and achieve more equitable outcomes in health, education, the economy, and in all walks of life here in Nova Scotia.

There is much more work to do, and more for us to learn. I want to acknowledge that I, as Premier, have more to learn.  I understand my privilege. 

But I am committed to listening, to working with communities, and to doing everything in my power to address racism and injustice in this province.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on the all-party committee that will discuss these issues openly, so that we can bring forward equity and anti-racism legislation in the spring.  

And I want to recognize the members opposite for the passion, the wisdom, and the experience they bring to this Legislature and to these important issues. We want to work together, and work with Nova Scotians, to tackle racism head-on and say in unison that racism has no place in this province.

Today our government is committing to another action from the Restorative Inquiry.

Over the next few months, we will work with community partners to design a Child and Youth Commission to protect and advance the rights, interests and viewpoints of children and youth in Nova Scotia.

While some other jurisdictions have a Child and Youth Advocate, this commission model will be unique to Nova Scotia. It will take a restorative approach and focus on working with children, youth, families and the entire care system.

We want to do this right. We will work with communities and our colleagues in this House to design legislation and introduce it next spring. We will have more details to share soon.

Mr. Speaker, I want to close by extending my profound gratitude once again, on behalf of this Legislature and all Nova Scotians, to the former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. Truly, we can never honour you enough.

I know many of you felt that when you were young, experiencing awful things that no child should ever experience, your voices went unheard. No one was listening.

I want to assure you again today that your voices matter. Your courage has changed the course of this government, and this province. And we want to make sure that no child in Nova Scotia ever feels unheard again. 

Thank you.","https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20211104001","2021-11-04T13:10:00.000"

"Community Services","Foster Care Redesign Increases Support for Children, Foster Families","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Foster Care Redesign Increases Support for Children, Foster Families 
------------------------------------------------------- 
Foster families are a key pillar of Nova Scotia’s child welfare system. They provide love, security and a strong foundation for the province’s most vulnerable children.

To strengthen support for foster families and the children in their care, the Province will invest up to $34 million over three years in a redesign of Nova Scotia’s foster care system, creating a modern and sustainable system that provides families and children the supports they need to flourish.

“Foster parents are among Nova Scotia’s most dedicated volunteers, and we need to ensure they are well-supported,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “Right now, Nova Scotia needs more foster parents, and it is my hope that a redesigned system will encourage more people to consider this calling.”

The redesign will include new financial supports and an immediate increase in per diem rates by $15 a day. It will also include:
-- engaging youth currently or formerly in care to hear their concerns and ideas
-- implementing a new system model that provides for a stronger community of support for foster families and children in care
-- new foster care placement types including enhanced respite care for children with specialized needs
-- improving communication and enhancing supports for foster parents during child welfare investigations.

The redesigned foster care program will prioritize maintaining a child’s culture while in care. Concerns and recommendations of First Nations and African Nova Scotian communities will be prioritized to ensure the needs of all children in foster care are met. One way this will be achieved is by recruiting more diverse foster families to ensure that children in care can be placed in culturally relevant homes within their respective communities.

When the redesign is fully implemented, there will be an annual increase in the foster care system budget of $16.7 million.

Quotes:
“Being a foster parent is both rewarding and challenging. It is encouraging and very much appreciated to see this work in support of foster families move forward.”
     - Marina Keeping, President of the Board of Directors, Federation of Foster Families of Nova Scotia

“I am so very pleased to learn that DCS is recognizing the valuable role played by foster parents within the province. Hopefully, this announcement will be a positive step towards recruitment and retention.”
     - Gary Landry, Executive Director, Federation of Foster Families of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- at any given time, there are approximately 1,000 children in care of the Province
-- approximately 65 per cent of those children are in foster care
-- there are currently about 630 foster families in Nova Scotia

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","Province Supports New Training Program for Boatbuilders","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Province Supports New Training Program for Boatbuilders
--------------------------------------------------
A partnership between the Province, the Nova Scotia Boatbuilders Association and Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) will provide skills training and employment opportunities while addressing a labour shortage in the boatbuilding industry. 

“We have a long, storied history of boatbuilding in Nova Scotia and a deep connection to the water,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “The industry employs more than 1,000 people, particularly in rural areas. Investments in skills development give life to the industry and help prepare and attract the next generation of Nova Scotia boatbuilders.”

The Province is investing $238,000 in an eight-week training program in composites fabrication through the One Journey Initiative. It is a partnership between the Department of Labour, Skills and Immigration, industry and community that provides skill development and employment opportunities to unemployed or underemployed Nova Scotians where there is an identified industry labour shortage.

The training will be offered by NSCC and include hands-on learning for participants. Three South Shore companies are hosting the hands-on component this fall: RPS Composites in Mahone Bay, Stelia North America in Lunenburg and Dagley’s Boatworks in East Lahave. Hands-on training during the winter 2022 course will take place at A.F. Theriault & Son Ltd. in Meteghan River.

More than a dozen companies in the boatbuilding industry require people skilled in composites fabrication and are willing to hire participants who complete the program.

Quotes:
“We’re really excited this composites training is happening. Not only does it give participants important foundational skills for our industry, it removes risk for both job seekers and employers by ensuring people have a good understanding of the work they’d be doing. We’re very appreciative of the support from the department of Labour, Skills and Immigration to make this possible.”
     - Jan Fullerton, Executive Director, Nova Scotia Boatbuilders Association

“There’s a sense of accomplishment, building something from scratch. We didn’t have skills in the beginning to build this stuff, but now, looking at it, we’ve come a long way. It’s really fulfilling. I’d like to continue building.”
     - Zubain Rafiq, course participant 

“I didn’t know anything but now we did this, so you actually feel like you accomplished something.”
     - Colby Redmond, course participant 

Quick Facts:
-- 10 seats were allocated to both the fall 2021 and winter 2022 courses; the boatbuilders association is looking to add additional seats to the winter course for a total of 20 participants
-- applications can be made directly to the association or through a Nova Scotia Works office
-- after finishing the program, participants will receive a certificate from NSCC and be eligible to work in aerospace, boatbuilding or general composites fabrication; they can also begin their apprenticeship in the boatbuilder trade as designated under the Apprenticeship and Trades Qualifications Act
-- the boatbuilding and repair industry includes approximately 60 companies in Nova Scotia and employs over 1,000 people
-- Labour, Skills and Immigration invests approximately $2.5 million annually in the One Journey Initiative, which supports up to 65 employers and helps 170 Nova Scotians with new skills and employment opportunities

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 14 novembre 2021.

"Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Tourism Industry Rebounds in July and August","COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE--Tourism Industry Rebounds in July and August
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia’s tourism industry began to rebound in July and August as border restrictions eased and people grew more comfortable travelling.

While visitation and accommodation bookings continue to be well below pre-pandemic levels, the industry is showing strong signs of recovery. Accommodation operators report 513,000 room nights sold in July and August, an increase of 82 per cent compared with the same months in 2020. During July and August, Nova Scotia welcomed 364,800 visitors. 

“Things are starting to improve for tourism and I feel positive about the industry’s future,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “Tourism is vital to our economy and communities in every region of this province. Now more than ever we need to work with businesses and organizations to develop and showcase our unique cultures, events, activities and attractions to support a strong recovery.”

While visitors from Atlantic Canada continue to make up most of the visitors to the province (52 per cent), national and international visitors have begun to return with 45 per cent of visitors arriving from other regions of Canada, and three per cent arriving from the United States and overseas in July and August.

Quotes:
“We are encouraged by the momentum in July and August and are hearing optimism from operators across Nova Scotia. However, Nova Scotia’s tourism industry lost $1.6 billion in 2020 and it will be a long road to full recovery. We have an incredible opportunity for a reset as we emerge in a post-COVID era and are pleased with the trends we are seeing and government’s strong support and commitment to rebuilding a year-round tourism economy.” 
     - Darlene Grant Fiander, President, Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
- Nova Scotia welcomed 232,000 non-resident visitors in August 2021, an increase of 124 per cent compared with August 2020
- 52,500 visitors arrived by air in August, more than double the total in the first seven months of the year and an increase of 393 per cent compared with August 2020
- there were 180,000 visitors by road in August, an increase of 93 per cent compared to August 2020 
- a preliminary estimate for 2020 tourism revenues is $1 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion compared with 2019

---------------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting Nova Scotians that Stearn House Trading and representatives operating under the names Michael Schwartz, Evan Donovan and Tom Bennett are not registered to trade in securities or derivatives in Nova Scotia.

Stearn House claims to be a full-featured online trading platform for major investments, including contracts for difference in various cryptocurrencies. It claims to be located at 250 Yonge St., Toronto.  

At least one Nova Scotian investor lost money after opening an account with Stearn House. This investor believed they were investing in cryptoassets. Requests to return funds and make withdrawals from their account have been ignored by Stearn House.

The Commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with firms that are not registered in Nova Scotia. People who have had contact with Stearn House or have been approached with an investment opportunity they believe may be fraudulent, should contact the commission or the securities regulator in their jurisdiction.

Quotes: 
“Always take time to verify registration and perform online searches for entities and any affiliated representatives prior to investing. While the internet can be a dangerous place to shop for investments, it can also be a vital asset to determine the legitimacy of an operation. Reviews, alerts, warnings, complaints and other useful information can be found online and may save you from irreversible financial loss. Remember, the basis of any scam is telling people what they want to hear. If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.”

Quick Facts:

Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 14 novembre 2021.

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Recruiters, Other Solutions to Attract Continuing Care Assistants","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Recruiters, Other Solutions to Attract Continuing Care Assistants 
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is moving ahead with plans to attract and retain more continuing care assistants and recruit other healthcare workers into the sector.

The Department of Seniors and Long-term Care has partnered with Health Association Nova Scotia to hire its first recruiter. Another five hires are in progress as part of a new $1.7 million investment. The recruiters will provide human resources support to long-term care facilities and home-care agencies throughout the province.

This investment will also create a skills development fund to help staff grow in their careers and an innovation fund to help long-term care facilities and home-care agencies find local solutions to obstacles that can prevent potential new employees from accepting a job, including moving costs, transportation, housing and tuition for training. 

“To provide Nova Scotians with the support and care they deserve as they age, we need a skilled workforce and facilities and agencies with the right staffing,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “We’re investing in supports to help the continuing care sector hire the staff it needs and help healthcare staff who work in the sector further develop their skills to improve the care of our loved ones.”

The investment will provide: 
-- $622,000 for six recruiters; two of the six will focus on hiring international healthcare workers
-- $360,000 for the skills development fund to help provide training so long-term staff can grow in their careers  
-- $360,000 for the innovation fund to help long-term care facilities and home-care agencies find local solutions to obstacles that could prevent a person from accepting or staying in a job  
-- $358,000 for related costs such as technology, promoting job postings, developing a website and promotional materials, travelling to recruitment events, and other expenses

Health Association Nova Scotia will hire the recruiters and administer the two funds. 

Quotes:
“Individuals who want to build a career taking care of our seniors are special, caring people and there are jobs waiting for them as soon as they complete their training. Continuing care is a specialty field that offers a challenging and rewarding career path for those who wish to make a positive impact on the lives of the community members they care for and their families. We need to recruit and retain more healthcare professionals, including locally and internationally, and we look forward to supporting and welcoming them here in Nova Scotia.” 
     - Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration 

“Nova Scotia’s continuing care providers identified the need for dedicated, specialized expertise to support their recruitment and retention efforts some time ago. We are very pleased to partner with the Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care to administer this provincial program and support concerted and innovative approaches to attracting and retaining new talent to these fields.”
     - Mary Lee, President and CEO, Health Association Nova Scotia 

“This is promising news for long-term care facilities like ours. This investment in recruiting is putting promises into welcomed actions. The approach is a concrete plan to help facilities and home-care agencies hire workers within continuing care. The addition of dedicated human resource expertise is vital for facilities across the province who are stretched beyond the ability to recruit and retain people on our own.” 
     - Angela Berrette, Executive Director, Saint Vincent’s Nursing Home, Halifax

Quick Facts: 
-- this investment stems from the work of the Long-Term Care Expert Panel to develop a provincial recruitment and retention strategy for continuing care 
-- Health Association Nova Scotia is a provincial association that represents healthcare employers, including nursing homes, home-care agencies and residential care facilities

----------------------------------------------------------------
The government continues to seek input on Traffic Safety Act draft regulations.

Nova Scotians can now provide feedback on proposed regulations that will define the offences and mandatory suspensions under the provincial act, as well as specify the penalties and fines associated with each offence. 

The draft regulations are available online effective today, October 29. 

This is the seventh set of proposed regulations that have been shared for public comment. Since September 2020, feedback has been collected on draft regulations for drivers, vehicles, rules for using the road, business licensing, roles and responsibilities, and administration.

An eighth section, Vehicle Weights and Dimensions, has been added as the final phase for public input. This section is part of the regulations for vehicles but was deferred during earlier public input.

The act and regulations will take effect after the public review and once required upgrades to the Registry of Motor Vehicles information system are completed.

Nova Scotians can get more information and provide feedback at: https://novascotia.ca/traffic-safety-act-public-engagement/

The deadline for feedback on the proposed Offences, Penalties and Mandatory Suspensions regulations is Monday, November 29.

Quick Facts:
-- the Traffic Safety Act was passed unanimously in the fall of 2018 and will replace the outdated Motor Vehicle Act, which was written in the early 1920s
-- the act is designed as a framework, setting broad policy and regulatory authority to quickly address changing technologies and future road-safety needs
-- since the last major revision in 1989, the Motor Vehicle Act has been amended more than 62 times
-- the legislation, once in effect, will be more concise than the current Motor Vehicle Act, moving technical detail to regulation and allowing more flexibility and responsiveness to emerging issues
-- the Traffic Safety Act reflects significant stakeholder engagement with 31 groups and 23 partners including Bicycle Nova Scotia, Insurance Bureau of Canada, Road Safety Advisory Committee, Nova Scotia Chiefs of Police and Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, and Dr. Shelley Deeks, Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health 
----------------------------------------------------------------
It has been almost 20 months since the start of the pandemic in Nova Scotia. During this time, we have witnessed the resiliency of Nova Scotians, the commitment of our healthcare workers, the strength of our healthcare system and the successful implementation of the largest vaccination program in our history.

However, these many months have not been without challenges. Misinformation spread by those who ignore the science on vaccination and challenge our system with unfounded claims creates unnecessary fear. This can have negative and damaging impacts on individuals and on our collective pandemic response.

Recent media coverage on the reporting of adverse events following immunization would have you believe that our healthcare providers are ill-equipped to recognize, manage or report these reactions.

This is not the case.

Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is one of the single most important steps you can take to protect yourself and others from this virus. The science is clear: the benefits far outweigh any risk associated with COVID-19 vaccines. However, no vaccine is 100 percent effective and vaccines, like almost all medical treatments, have some risk of an adverse event.

All vaccines in Canada are highly regulated and monitored. This includes COVID-19 vaccines. Clinical trials and real-world use of these vaccines show that they are safe and effective. We know this to be true because we, like other jurisdictions, share information with the Government of Canada, who in turn share it with the international community monitoring vaccine safety.

In Nova Scotia, healthcare providers who suspect that a patient has experienced a serious or unusual reaction to a vaccine are legally required to report it to public health.

Throughout the pandemic, healthcare providers have received regular communication on the ever-evolving clinical and public health information on the COVID-19 virus and our provincial response. This includes information on COVID-19 vaccines, expected adverse events following immunization and what, how and where to report these events. 

We fully understand the pressures healthcare providers are under. The uncertainty of the pandemic and the concerns of patients can at times be overwhelming. This does not mean that providers will not continue to honour their professional responsibilities.

Nova Scotians should know that our rates for serious adverse events following COVID-19 immunization are low – about seven for every 100,000 given doses. This is consistent with national rates and is much lower than the risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. We are working on a plan to share data on adverse events with Nova Scotians and hope to be able to share more about that soon.

We remain committed to ensuring ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety, not just for COVID-19 vaccines, but for all vaccines used in the province.

"L'nu Affairs / Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage","Spring Legislation will Enshrine Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s First Language","L’NU AFFAIRS/COMMUNITIES/CULTURE/TOURISM/HERITAGE--Spring Legislation will Enshrine Mi’kmaw as Nova Scotia’s First Language
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The Mi’kmaw translation of the news release follows
----------------------------------------------------------------
Mi’kmaq is Nova Scotia’s first language and legislation next spring will help preserve, revitalize and promote it. 

The number of people who can speak Mi’kmaw is in rapid decline and the Mi’kmaw language is at risk. The government will start working immediately with Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey, the collective voice for Mi’kmaq education, and other Mi’kmaq organizations and communities to develop legislation to support this effort.

“Language is a fundamental aspect of cultural identity and the Mi’kmaw language reflects the culture of the First Peoples of this province,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of L’nu Affairs. “Mi’kmaw language revitalization is critical to understanding and preserving Mi’kmaw culture and supports ongoing reconciliation.”
   
Several Mi’kmaw language speakers are teaching and preserving the language in schools and communities. The Province will support those efforts by reinforcing the reconciliation work undertaken by the Treaty Education Nova Scotia initiative and through the collaborative development of legislation to ensure that hearing, seeing and speaking the language becomes a normal part of life in Nova Scotia.

Quotes:
“The Mi’kmaw language legislation will allow for the Mi’kmaq to work in partnership with our provincial counterparts. The development of Mi’kmaw language legislation is a pivotal step in the revitalization and retention of the Mi’kmaw language. It is imperative for reconciliation that the Mi’kmaw language be seen and heard across the entire province. It is also important for society at large to see the importance of the preservation and protection of the Mi’kmaq language. This endeavour is not something our Mi’kmaq leadership can do alone, so we are very excited to begin this process together.”
      - Chief Leroy Denny, Eskasoni First Nation, Chair, Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey

“I am overjoyed and anticipate only good things to come from the work we set out to do. We need to work hard for the survival of our language and our ways of being and knowing for our children and future generations. The original language of this land is Mi’kmaw and it is our intention to restore this language for all generations whether you live in community or in urban settings.”
     - Blaire Gould, Executive Director, Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey

“As a language teacher, the state of the language is constantly on my mind. In this crucial time for the Mi'kmaw language, recognizing Mi'kmaw as the first language of Nova Scotia could help to prevent the extinction of the land's natural language, to heal the youth through the reclamation of our identities, and to ensure that the efforts of those who fought to preserve the language haven't been in vain.”
     – Jasmine Ma’sl, Language Teacher, Potlotek First Nation

“It’s the right thing to do because the language comes from this land, and from the people. People are losing our language, and it’s been a long fight to keep it alive. This legislation will reinforce the importance of us and our language.”
     – Elder Silipay Denny, the oldest Mi’kmaq Elder in Nova Scotia, Eskasoni First Nation

Quick Facts:
-- Mi’kmaw Kina’matnewey is the collective voice for Mi’kmaq education in 12 of the 13 Mi’kmaw communities in Nova Scotia; it also administers the Indigenous Languages Component (ILC), a Canadian Heritage funding program, which supports the preservation and revitalization of the Mi’kmaw language
-- Mi’kmaw will be recognized as the first language of the Province under the legislation
-- this legislation aligns with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and would reinforce the importance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action for governments to preserve, promote, revitalize and protect Aboriginal languages through legislation and education
-- in 2019, a Mi’kmaw Language Task Team, represented by the Province and Mi’kmaq, engaged all Mi’kmaw communities and the Mi’kmaq Native Friendship Centre to create The Mi’kmaw Language Initiative – Nova Scotia Mi’kmaq Community Engagement Sessions Report 2019; it recommends that the protection of language be facilitated by legislation
-- in 2027, if current trends continue, children aged four and younger will not be able to speak Mi’kmaq; the number of children under age four learning Mi’kmaw decreased from 44 per cent in 1999 to just 20 per cent in 2013

"Natural Resources and Renewables","Safety First During Hunting, Trapping Season","NATURAL RESOURCES/RENEWABLES--Safety First During Hunting, Trapping Season
--------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians are reminded to put safety first during hunting and trapping season.

General deer hunting season opens today, October 29, and continues to December 4. The dates vary for other types of game.

“About 140,000 Nova Scotians have a Wildlife Resources Card, which allows them to enjoy the recreational, social and economic benefits of hunting and trapping,” said Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton. “Those planning to be in the woods this time of year are reminded to wear hunter orange, respect private landowners and keep pets on a leash or under supervision when in wildlife habitat.”

Hunters are required to carry a compass, knife or axe, and waterproof matches. Anyone going into the woods should also carry a map or GPS unit, a first-aid kit and a communications device. They should tell someone when and where they will be in the woods and when they plan to be back.

Approved traps and snares can be set in wildlife habitat, on land and in water until March 31.

The public is urged to report poaching or illegal hunting activities to a Department of Natural Resources and Renewables office or call 1-800-565-2224.

Harvests can be reported online through the Wildlife Resources System website: https://wrs.novascotia.ca/ 

Quick Facts:
-- hunting is not allowed on Sundays except for October 31 and November 7
-- through the purchase of Wildlife Habitat Stamps, hunters and trappers contribute an average of $200,000 a year to the Nova Scotia Habitat Conservation Fund to support biodiversity conservation and research

"Health and Wellness","Funding for Pharmacist Assessment to Help Prevent Lyme Disease","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Funding for Pharmacist Assessment to Help Prevent Lyme Disease
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians who get bitten by a tick can now go to their local pharmacy to assess the need for treatment to help prevent Lyme disease. The cost of the assessment will be covered by the government, effective immediately.  

Nova Scotians who had a tick bite previously had to go to a physician or nurse practitioner to get a provincially covered assessment. 

“I am from rural Nova Scotia where ticks and tick bites are a frequent reality,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “We want to give Nova Scotians increased access to care when and where it makes sense. Pharmacists are a big part of that and funding assessments at local pharmacies often makes it easier and more convenient for people, whether rural or urban residents, to prevent this potentially serious disease.”

Pharmacists can assess and determine whether a preventive antibiotic is appropriate. The assessment would include: 
-- whether the tick bite was from a blacklegged tick 
-- whether the tick was removed in the previous 72 hours
-- whether the tick was attached for at least 36 hours.

If the antibiotic treatment – a single dose of doxycycline – is prescribed, the patient would pay for the medication by their usual method.    

The treatment is only recommended if it can be administered within a 72-hour window after the tick is removed. If there are any symptoms of Lyme disease, such as a rash at the bite site, people need to see a doctor or nurse practitioner for other treatment options.  

Quotes:
“The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to prevent tick bites altogether, but in certain circumstances where there has been a tick bite, doxycycline remains an effective option to prevent the onset of Lyme disease. It is good news knowing that people can easily go to their local pharmacy to get this assessment for free.” 
     - Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's Chief Medical Officer of Health

“We are very happy with the government’s decision to fund another important pharmacy service for something that can be quite urgent. This early preventive service can stop Lyme disease in its tracks.”
     - Diane Harpell, Chair, Pharmacy Association of Nova Scotia, and pharmacist / pharmacy owner, Dartmouth 

Quick Facts:
-- in 2019, there were 830 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease reported in Nova Scotia
-- Lyme disease is a serious bacterial infection caused by bites from an infected blacklegged tick; symptoms include a rash at the site of the bite, fatigue, fever or chills, headache, muscle or joint pain, numbness or tingling, swollen lymph nodes, cognitive dysfunction or dizziness, nervous system disorders, arthritis, or heart palpitations
-- antibiotics can be used to successfully treat most cases of Lyme disease
-- people can prevent tick bites by avoiding walking in forest or high-grass areas, tucking pant legs into socks and shirt into pants, wearing light-coloured clothing to make it easier to spot ticks, applying bug spray with DEET or icaridin to clothing, doing a daily check for ticks, and drying wet clothes in the dryer for at least 10 minutes

----------------------------------------------------------------
Legislation introduced today, October 29, will support efforts to promote Nova Scotia as a top-tier destination for visitors from around the world.

The Tourism Nova Scotia Dissolution Act transitions Tourism Nova Scotia from a Crown corporation to a division of the Department of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage.

“Tourism is a vital part of a strong Nova Scotia economy,” said Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “As a division of the department, tourism will be even better equipped to promote all that Nova Scotia has to offer – from our unique events and destinations to diverse cultures and vibrant communities.”

The bill repeals the Tourism Nova Scotia Act and dissolves Tourism Nova Scotia and its board. Tourism staff become employees in the provincial civil service.

Revocation of board member appointments will take effect upon Royal Assent, and all changes will be finalized by January 1.

Quick Facts:
- transitioning tourism to a division of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage is one of the commitments in the Minister’s mandate letter to support the development of Nova Scotia’s tourism industry

"Executive Council","Amendments Formalize Changes in Government Structure","EXECUTIVE COUNCIL--Amendments Formalize Changes in Government Structure
----------------------------------------------------------------
Amendments introduced today, October 29, update legislation to reflect changes to government structure.

There have been several restructuring changes to government and transfers of ministerial responsibilities through orders-in-council over the past few years. The Public Service Act and the Executive Council Act are being updated to reflect these changes.

“We’re working hard to deliver on the priorities that Nova Scotians have told us matter to them – fixing healthcare, ensuring addictions and mental health receives the dedicated attention it deserves and positioning our economy for growth,” said Premier Tim Houston. “These amendments ensure legislation reflects the current structure of government.”

The amendments include:
-- creation of the Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care
-- updating department names, such as Department of Public Works
-- consolidation of the Department of Lands and Forestry and Department of Energy and Mines into the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables
-- creation of the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment 
-- updating the renamed Office of Priorities and Planning 
-- referencing the previously created Offices of Equity and Anti-Racism Initiatives, and Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness
-- assigning of responsibility for improving the health of Nova Scotians through participation in physical activity, sport and recreation to the Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage
-- assigning of environmental services for the Government of the Province, superintendence and management of government buildings and property to the Department of Public Works
-- explicitly stating the mandate of the Executive Council Office in the Public Service Act.

The changes to government structure are already in place.

Quick Facts:
-- the Public Service Act describes the basic departmental/office structure of the public service
-- the Executive Council Act sets out ministerial portfolios for members of Executive Council and provides authority for administrative functions such as the appointment of acting ministers

"Justice","Amendment to Cannabis Legislation Protects Nova Scotians from Unreasonable Searches","JUSTICE--Amendment to Cannabis Legislation Protects Nova Scotians from Unreasonable Searches
----------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 28, the government introduced an amendment to the Cannabis Control Act to clarify the standard of reasonableness required to search a place or vehicle.

In a recent provincial court case, the section of the act that deals with search and seizure was found to lack clarity and ruled statutorily invalid.

“Public health and safety are the primary goals of our cannabis legislation, but it is equally important that the charter rights of Nova Scotians are protected from unreasonable searches,” said Brad Johns, Minister of Justice and Attorney General. “We believe this amendment strikes that balance.”

The amendment to section 24(1)(a) of the Cannabis Control Act requires the standard of “reasonableness” to ensure compliance with the charter and clarity to law enforcement officers.

Police investigating violations under the act will need to have “reasonable grounds to believe” before conducting a search for illegal cannabis. The act currently allows an officer to conduct a search “at any reasonable time.”

The standard is in line with the law in other provinces.

The objective of the act is to protect public health and safety; protect youth and restrict their access to cannabis; ensure cannabis is sold in accordance with the act; and to deter unlawful activities in relation to cannabis through appropriate enforcement and sanctions.

Quick Facts:
-- in an oral decision on March 4, the Nova Scotia provincial court ruled in R. vs. Daniels that the search of Mr. Daniels’s car by police was unreasonable
-- the court ruled that inspection powers in the Cannabis Control Act infringed on Mr. Daniels’s rights under section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
-- that section of the charter protects individuals against unreasonable search and seizure, requiring that all searches be reasonable

"Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services / Municipal Affairs and Housing  / Public Works","Legislation Supports Housing Plan, Capping Rent Increases, Addressing Supply","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING/PUBLIC WORKS/SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES--Legislation Supports Housing Plan, Capping Rent Increases, Addressing Supply
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians need a safe, affordable place to call home. The housing crisis affects individuals, families and communities every day. The Province is committed to addressing the housing crisis, and today, October 28, it is introducing three pieces of legislation to support the housing plan announced last week.

Tenants will continue to be protected against large rent increases for the next two years. Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services, introduced the Interim Residential Rental Increase Cap Act to allow for the current two per cent cap on rent increases to continue while the Province works to improve the availability of affordable housing.

The current rent cap under the ministerial directive will continue until it expires on February 1, 2022, or when the state of emergency ends, whichever occurs first. The Interim Residential Rental Increase Cap Act will apply when the current cap expires to ensure there is no gap in protection for tenants. The act will remain in place until December 31, 2023.

The interim rent cap will protect existing tenants from high rent increases.

Increasing housing supply is key to addressing the housing crisis. The Act to Establish the Executive Panel on Housing in the Halifax Regional Municipality, tabled by Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr, will set up a planning task force, as announced last week. This group will report to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing but will provide advice both to the Province and municipality on how to quickly increase housing supply.

It is also important to consider the transportation issues that come with rapid growth and that is why Public Works Minister Kim Masland introduced An Act to Establish a Joint Regional Transportation Agency. The agency will work with Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to ensure the municipality’s transportation system is prepared for a period of unprecedented growth.

The agency will also be mandated to create a five-year master transportation plan to guide their work. It will be set up as a Crown corporation and have a small staff, including technical experts selected by the Department of Public Works and HRM.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotians are facing affordable housing challenges never seen before in our province, and we are here to support. We know we need to grow the housing supply and in the short term, we need the rent cap to give tenants certainty and peace of mind.”
     - Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services

“We want to work together with Halifax Regional Municipality to increase housing supply and clear roadblocks. The Executive Panel on Housing will put staff from both the Province and HRM at the table together to quickly identify roadblocks and solve them, so we can build more housing quickly.”
     - John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing

“Improving the flow of people and goods in and out of Halifax Regional Municipality is critical to HRM’s residents and to all Nova Scotians. The Joint Regional Transportation Agency will review roads, ferries and public transit to ensure that the transportation system is set up for growth.”
     - Kim Masland, Minister of Public Works

Quick Facts:
-- the current rent cap, introduced in November 2020, limits rent increases to two per cent per year and ends on February 1, 2022, or at the end of the provincial state of emergency, whichever is sooner
-- the rent cap won’t apply to Rent Geared to Income leases under public housing programs and land-lease communities (mobile home parks) because they have their own processes for setting rental increase rates
-- the Joint Regional Transportation Agency will have an advisory board appointed by the Minister of Public Works; the board will include representatives from HRM and the Department of Public Works as well as other stakeholders such as the Halifax Port Authority, Halifax International Airport Authority and Halifax Harbour Bridges
-- the five-year master transportation plan developed by the agency will be approved by the provincial cabinet

"Premier's Office / Health and Wellness","Toutes les infirmières diplômées obtiendront une offre d’emploi","BUREAU DU PREMIER MINISTRE/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Toutes les infirmières diplômées obtiendront une offre d’emploi
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui, le 28 octobre, le premier ministre Tim Houston a annoncé que toutes les infirmières diplômées des universités de la Nouvelle-Écosse et du Nova Scotia Community College au cours des cinq prochaines années se verront offrir un emploi dans la province.

Toutes les infirmières de la promotion de cette année et jusqu’en 2026, qui souhaitent travailler en Nouvelle-Écosse, se verront garantir un emploi au sein de Santé Nouvelle-Écosse, du IWK Health Centre ou du secteur des soins continus. Elles auront des renseignements sur les possibilités offertes et recevront une offre d’emploi.
 
« Nous prenons les grands moyens pour résoudre les problèmes dans le secteur des soins de santé en Nouvelle-Écosse, a affirmé le premier ministre Tim Houston. Toutes les personnes diplômées en sciences infirmières d’un établissement néo-écossais au cours des cinq prochaines années recevront une offre d’emploi permanente pour travailler ici. Je veux que les étudiantes en sciences infirmières sachent que nous ne les tenons pas pour acquis, et j’espère que cela montre à quel point nous les tenons en haute estime et que nous attachons de l’importance à leurs compétences, à leur énergie et à leur compassion. »

Chaque année, près de 700 infirmières autorisées et infirmières auxiliaires autorisées obtiennent leur diplôme en Nouvelle-Écosse. 

L’Office du recrutement des professionnels de la santé supervisera l’initiative en question.

Citations
« On a besoin d’infirmières dans bien des régions partout en Nouvelle-Écosse. C’est un peu à cause de cela que je veux devenir infirmière. Le fait de savoir que j’aurai une offre d’emploi garantie pour travailler en Nouvelle-Écosse lorsque je serai diplômée m’enlève un peu de pression sur les épaules pendant que j’achève mes études. Voilà le genre de pensée progressiste dont nous avons besoin pour garder les nouvelles personnes diplômées en sciences infirmières dans la province. »
- Anika Daclan, coprésidente de la Dalhousie University Nursing Society et étudiante en sciences infirmières

« Je suis infirmière autorisée depuis 30 ans, et je me souviens du temps où j’étais étudiante et sur le point d’obtenir mon diplôme. Il y a beaucoup de facteurs à considérer en ce qui a trait au lieu de travail. Alors que la prochaine génération d’étudiantes en sciences infirmières examine ses options, nous voulons qu’elle sache qu’il existe de nombreuses possibilités d’emploi dans divers secteurs et régions ici même, en Nouvelle-Écosse. Il y a une place pour elle au sein de notre système de soins de santé. »

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A statement by Premier Tim Houston, read in the House of Assembly today, October 28, follows the release
----------------------------------------------------------------
Premier Tim Houston announced today, October 28, all nurses graduating from Nova Scotia’s universities and Nova Scotia Community College for the next five years will be offered a job in the province.

Every nurse who wants a job in Nova Scotia from the current graduating class until 2026 will be guaranteed one with Nova Scotia Health, the IWK or the continuing care sector. They will receive information about available opportunities and receive job offers.
 
“We are taking bold action to solve the healthcare problems in Nova Scotia,” said Premier Houston. “Every nursing graduate coming out of a Nova Scotia school over the next five years has a standing offer to work right here. I want nursing students to know we are not taking them for granted, and I hope this shows how much we value them and their skill, energy and compassion.”

Each year, Nova Scotia graduates about 700 registered nurses and licensed practical nurses.

The initiative will be overseen by the Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment.

Quotes: 
“Nurses are needed in so many areas across Nova Scotia – it’s part of why I want to become a nurse. A guaranteed job offer to work in Nova Scotia when I graduate takes some of the pressure off as I complete my studies. This is the kind of forward thinking we need to keep new nursing grads here in the province.” 
     - Anika Daclan, Co-president, Dalhousie University Nursing Society and Nursing Student 

“I’ve been a registered nurse for 30 years, and I remember being a student about to graduate – there are a lot of factors to consider when determining where to work. As the next generation of nursing students considers their options, we want them to know there are many great job opportunities for them in various areas and locations, right here in Nova Scotia. There is a place for them in our healthcare system.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Health and Wellness Minister

Quick Facts:
-- nurses are educated at Dalhousie University, St. Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University, Université Sainte-Anne and the Nova Scotia Community College
-- about 450 registered nurses and about 250 licensed practical nurses graduate every year from Nova Scotia schools

Statement by Premier Tim Houston: 

Mr. Speaker, it’s no secret that Nova Scotia needs nurses.  

There are currently hundreds of vacancies for nurses in the system. And our plan to transform our health system means that we will need many more than that.  

We are fortunate to have excellent universities and colleges in our province that graduate about 700 nurses every year - registered nurses and licensed practical nurses.

But, there has been criticism that the government and Nova Scotia Health haven’t done all they could to let those eager, talented graduates know they are needed, and wanted, right here at home.  

Well Mr. Speaker, that ends today.  

This Government is taking bold action today to keep our best and brightest nursing grads here. We want them to have career stability and opportunities for advancement, right here at home.

I’m announcing today that every nursing grad coming out of a school in this province, over the next five years, has a standing offer to work in Nova Scotia.  

If they want to work in our health system when they finish their studies, there is a place for them.

I’m sure every member of this House was disappointed to hear the news last week that recruiters from British Columbia were meeting with our graduating nurses and offering bonuses, while some students felt they didn’t get the same treatment from local recruiters.

This government will usher in a new era of respect between healthcare workers and government.  

It started with the Speak Up for Healthcare tour. I was honoured to meet face to face with so many health professionals and listen to their solutions for a better system.  

Because of them, there will be change for the better in our system. 

With this announcement today, I am signaling to nursing students that Nova Scotia needs - and wants - their skill, their energy and their compassion.  

That’s not lip service. Starting today, those nurses will know that if they graduate, they have a job with Nova Scotia Health, the IWK or the continuing care sector.  

I met with nursing students across the province earlier this week. I heard them. They have anxiety about the future.

I want to be perfectly clear, we will do whatever we can to make it possible for these students to work in their chosen field, in their chosen region.

Under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Orrell, first year nurses will receive job offers. And they will be given information about all the opportunities and programs that are available here. 

Nursing students will know that they are not taken for granted, Mr. Speaker.  

They will understand that they are respected and valued in Nova Scotia and they don’t have to go to BC, Ontario or the States to find work. 

Talented, young nurses will walk out of school and be able to start their careers right away. Right here in Nova Scotia.  

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.","https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20211028005","2021-10-28T13:08:00.000"

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 28, Nova Scotia is reporting 31 new cases of COVID-19 and five recoveries.

There are 17 cases in Central Zone, eight cases in Western Zone, three cases in Eastern Zone and three cases in Northern Zone.

On October 27, one school was notified of an exposure(s) at the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 171 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 10 people are in hospital, including one in ICU.

On October 27, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,853 tests.

As of October 27, 1,569,889 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 759,771 Nova Scotians have received their second dose, and 2,055 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 1,432 positive COVID-19 cases and six deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 1,255 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 31, 2021

Aujourd’hui 28 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 31 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 5 rétablissements.

Il y a 17 cas dans le secteur du centre, 8 cas dans le secteur de l’ouest, 3 cas dans le secteur de l’est et 3 cas dans le secteur du nord. 

Le 27 octobre, on a avisé les responsables d’une école d’une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de son établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 171 cas actifs de COVID-19. Dix personnes sont hospitalisées, dont une aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 853 tests le 27 octobre.

Au 27 octobre, 1 569 889 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 759 771 étaient une deuxième dose, et 2 055 étaient une troisième dose administrée aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 432 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et six décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 255. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr . Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 31 octobre 2021.

"Environment and Climate Change","Legislation to Address Climate Crisis, Guide Province to Cleaner, Sustainable Future","ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE CHANGE--Legislation to Address Climate Crisis, Guide Province to Cleaner, Sustainable Future
----------------------------------------------------------
The Province is introducing an ambitious plan to guide Nova Scotia toward a cleaner, healthier environment where the benefits of being a leader in environmental sustainability and a better quality of life go hand in hand.

The Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act introduced today, October 27, sets 28 new goals, including the strongest 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target in Canada. Nova Scotia is committing to reduce emissions to at least 53 per cent below the levels that were emitted in 2005 by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050.

The legislation also requires that equity be a principle throughout all of the goals.

“Nova Scotians care deeply about the environment and the changing climate and we have listened to their ideas about greening our economy and protecting the environment,” said Environment and Climate Change Minister Tim Halman. “We are at a pivotal moment and this legislation will showcase Nova Scotia as a world leader in adopting and achieving bold environmental goals. Nova Scotians have shown – in environmental action and through this pandemic – that we can have a greater and more positive impact when we work together.”

The legislation contains solutions that will guide Nova Scotia toward sustainable prosperity over the next 10 years and beyond. It will result in the Province working more closely with partners to encourage the growth of a cleaner economy and greening of traditional industries.

Some of the goals include:
-- 80 per cent of Nova Scotia’s energy to be supplied by renewable energy by 2030
-- 30 per cent of vehicle sales by 2030 to be zero-emission vehicles 
-- conserve at least 20 per cent of total land and water mass
-- develop a provincial food strategy and support consumption of local food
-- modernize the environmental assessment process to include consideration of cumulative impacts; Netukulimk – the traditional Mi’kmaq concept of connection and balance between the natural and human worlds; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and independent review
-- reduce solid waste disposal rates to no more than 300 kilograms per person per year by 2030.

The legislation commits the government to releasing annual progress reports. The Minister’s Round Table on the Environment and Sustainable Prosperity will also carry out a review of the legislation within five years.

Quotes:
“With this legislation, Nova Scotia will have a broad and ambitious set of targets, goals and actions to guide our collective efforts in the challenge of the climate emergency over the next decade and toward a net zero and sustainable future. The Minister’s round table looks forward to providing support and tracking progress on the many efforts required to achieve sustainable prosperity, while focusing on equity and the well-being of all Nova Scotians.”
     - Scott Skinner, Chair, Minister’s Round Table on the Environment and Sustainable Prosperity

Quick Facts:
-- a climate change plan outlining specific actions will follow in the spring
-- Netukulimk is defined by the Mi’kmaq as the use of the natural bounty provided by the Creator for the self-support and well-being of the individual and the community by achieving adequate standards of community nutrition and economic well-being without jeopardizing the integrity, diversity or productivity of the environment
-- this legislation builds on the Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act, which was introduced and passed in 2007
-- consultations on the new act were held from May 27 to July 26; 1,342 submissions containing more than 5,600 individual ideas were shared

"Community Services","Privacy Tools Available for Adoption Records","COMMUNITY SERVICES--Privacy Tools Available for Adoption Records
----------------------------------------------------------
Adoption is a profoundly personal matter, and many Nova Scotians may feel strongly about the sharing of their information. The Province is introducing new privacy tools for adoption records to give people the option of protecting their information before adoption records are opened in the spring.

The Province’s Disclosure Program is now accepting disclosure vetoes and contact notices. A disclosure veto is a document stating an adoptee or birth parent does not wish to share information that can identify them. A contact notice allows people to share information that can identify them but allows them to set parameters around if or how they choose to be contacted.

“We know that opening adoption records is a long-awaited decision by many, and we also recognize that Nova Scotians may feel strongly about the sharing of their information,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “We want people to have time to consider their options and protect their privacy if they wish. This is a sensitive matter, and we want to be respectful of all those involved in sharing adoption records.”

The Adoption Records Act will take effect in the spring. It allows adopted people – once they turn 19 – birth parents, potential birth parents and relatives to access adoption information if they choose. This will apply to all adoption records. It is important to note that people who have indicated in the past that they do not want their identifying information shared must file a disclosure veto if they want their information to remain private.

This is a change from the current law which allows for a search for an adopted person or a birth parent at the request of the other party to the adoption. When that person is located, they must consent to their identifying information being released before it can be shared. If they do not consent, the identifying information cannot be shared.

Quotes:
“We are excited to see Nova Scotia taking the next stage in opening adoption records. We are very pleased to see steps being taken to ensure the privacy of those impacted. As adoptees ourselves, we understand the delicacy and importance of privacy being respected while we go through this process. We were adamant about a veto that gives those involved control over their information yet allows families who wish to reunite to do so.""
     - Scott Pyke, Administrator, Nova Scotia Adoptee Advocacy Group

Quick Facts: 
-- the Adoption Records Act was passed in April
-- adoptions have been recorded in Nova Scotia for more than 100 years; the Department of Community Services holds the records for about 31,800 adoptions granted during this time
-- over the last 11 years, an average of 150 children were adopted each year
-- the Department partnered with the Association of Black Social Workers this summer to engage with African Nova Scotian communities on implementing the change
-- the Department also consulted with Mi’kmaq bands and has worked with the Nova Scotia Adoptee Advocacy Group throughout the process

"Community Services","Outils de confidentialité pour les dossiers d'adoption","SERVICES COMMUNAUTAIRES--Outils de confidentialité pour les dossiers d'adoption
----------------------------------------------------
L'adoption est une question profondément personnelle, et bon nombre de gens ont de fortes opinions au sujet de la divulgation de leurs renseignements. Le gouvernement provincial présente de nouveaux outils de confidentialité pour les dossiers d'adoption afin de donner aux gens l'option de protéger leurs renseignements personnels avant l'ouverture des dossiers d'adoption au printemps.

Le Programme de divulgation de la Province accepte maintenant les veto à la divulgation et les avis sur la prise de contact. Un veto à la divulgation est un document qui indique qu'une personne adoptée ou un parent biologique ne souhaite pas que l'on divulgue des renseignements qui permettraient de les identifier. Un avis sur la prise de contact permet aux gens de divulguer des renseignements identificatoires, mais également d'établir des paramètres sur la prise de contact, soit la façon dont on peut communiquer avec eux ou s'ils ne souhaitent pas qu'on communique avec eux.

« Nous savons que l'ouverture des dossiers d'adoption est une décision longuement attendue, et nous reconnaissons également que les gens peuvent avoir de fortes opinions au sujet de la divulgation de leurs renseignements, affirme Karla MacFarlane, ministre des Services communautaires. Nous voulons donner le temps aux gens de considérer les options qui s'offrent à eux pour protéger leurs renseignements personnels, s'ils le souhaitent. Il s'agit d'une question délicate et nous voulons faire preuve de respect envers les personnes touchées par l'ouverture des dossiers d'adoption. »

La loi sur les dossiers d'adoption (Adoption Records Act) entrera en vigueur au printemps. Elle permettra aux personnes adoptées (lorsqu'elles auront 19 ans), aux parents biologiques, aux parents biologiques possibles et aux autres parents d'accéder aux renseignements sur l'adoption, s'ils le souhaitent. Ce changement s'appliquera à tous les dossiers d'adoption. Il est important de noter que les gens qui ont indiqué dans le passé ne pas vouloir divulguer leurs renseignements personnels devront déposer un veto à la divulgation s'ils souhaitent que leurs renseignements personnels demeurent confidentiels.

Il s'agit d'un changement par rapport à la loi actuelle, qui permet une recherche pour une personne adoptée ou un parent biologique à la demande de l'autre partie à l'adoption. Quand la personne a été trouvée, on doit lui demander si elle consent à la divulgation de ses renseignements identificatoires. Si la personne refuse son consentement, les renseignements identificatoires ne peuvent pas être divulgués.

Citation
« Nous sommes ravis de voir que la Nouvelle-Écosse passe à la prochaine étape de l'ouverture des dossiers d'adoption tout en prenant des mesures pour assurer la confidentialité des renseignements des personnes concernées. À titre de personne adoptée, je comprends que la confidentialité est une question délicate et importante qui doit être respectée dans ce processus. Nous avons insisté pour la mise en place d'un veto qui offre aux personnes concernées un contrôle sur leurs renseignements tout en permettant aux familles qui le souhaitent de se retrouver. » 
     - Scott Pyke, Nova Scotia Adoptee Advocacy Group

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Children 12 and Older Isolate Based on Vaccination Status","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Children 12 and Older Isolate Based on Vaccination Status
---------------------------------------------------------
Starting November 1, all domestic travellers to Nova Scotia who are age 12 and older will have self-isolation requirements based on their own vaccination status.

“When we shifted to isolation based on vaccination status in June, vaccine was just becoming available for children, so they followed the rules for the least vaccinated adult they were traveling with,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Since then, there has been ample opportunity for children 12 and over to get vaccinated. It’s time to treat them the same as adults in our border policy.”

With this change, everyone 12 and older needs to have their own Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form that reflects their own vaccination status. Adults can complete the form on behalf of children.

People who were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arriving do not have to isolate, but testing is recommended. People who are not fully vaccinated must isolate for at least seven days and get two negative test results in Nova Scotia to stop isolating after seven days. They must be lab-based tests, not rapid tests.

Children who are 11 and under will continue to isolate with the least vaccinated adult they are traveling with. They can be included on the Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form for that adult.

International travelers continue to follow federal requirements under the Quarantine Act.

"Justice","Amendments to Fatality Investigations Act","JUSTICE--Amendments to Fatality Investigations Act
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is making changes to ensure timely and thorough reviews are carried out in cases of unexpected death.

Bill 180, An Act to Amend the Fatality Investigations Act, comes into force today, October 27. 

The amendments will establish both a Domestic Violence Review Committee and a Child Death Review Committee and enable other types of death review committees if needed in the future. 

“The death of a loved one under any circumstances is hard,” said Justice Minister Brad Johns. “It is this government’s hope that the findings of these review committees will give the families some comfort and confidence in knowing the death of a loved one has been independently examined by experts.”

The Domestic Violence Death Review Committee will do trend analysis and in-depth reviews to better understand the circumstances of deaths due to domestic violence. The process is intended to promote a deeper understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence and improve prevention and intervention approaches.

The Child Death Review Committee will analyze deaths of those under the age of 25 to look at patterns, with the aim of preventing other fatalities. It will also conduct in-depth case reviews of the deaths of children under 19 in the care of the Province. 

The overall goal of the committees will be to conduct multi-disciplinary, in-depth reviews and make recommendations to prevent similar deaths in the future. 

Current mechanisms for reviewing the circumstances of a death and making public recommendations in Nova Scotia include a fatality inquiry, the Police Act, and the Public Inquiries Act. 

Death review committees will be chaired by the province’s Chief Medical Examiner and will bring together experts from within and outside of government to examine the facts and circumstances.

Quotes:
“Deaths are always tragic, but a death that was preventable is even more so. These committees will help us to learn the lessons that will prevent deaths in the future. It will be a privilege to begin this work.”
     - Dr. Matt Bowes, Chief Medical Examiner

Quick Facts:
-- the Department of Justice worked with staff from the Department of Community Services, the Department of Health and Wellness, the Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women, and the Chief Medical Examiner to determine the content of the amendments and the regulations
-- committees will be chaired by the Chief Medical Examiner and membership will be comprised of government and non-government appointees, including medical professionals and representatives from community organizations, law enforcement, academia and government
-- a full report on the review of a death will be submitted to the Minister of Justice, and in the case of a child death review, the Minister will share the report with the department whose care the child was under
-- a public report will be produced annually from both committees, summarizing their work and analyzing data trends over time

Aujourd'hui 26 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Une septuagénaire est morte dans le secteur de l’ouest.

« Je suis attristé d’apprendre qu’une autre famille a perdu un être cher, a indiqué le premier ministre Tim Houston. C’est là un sombre rappel de toute la gravité de ce virus. Je sais que la situation dure depuis longtemps, et que les gens sont fatigués, mais il ne faut surtout pas baisser la garde. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également 7 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 24 cas résolus.

Les sept cas ont été dépistés dans le secteur du centre.

« J'offre mes prières et mes condoléances à la famille et aux proches de la dame qui est décédée, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Le vaccin peut empêcher d’être gravement malade, d’être hospitalisé et de mourir. Faites-vous vacciner, si ce n’est pas déjà fait, pour vous protéger et pour protéger les gens qui vous entourent. »

Le 25 octobre, aucune école n’a été avisée d’une exposition au virus. Chaque fois qu’il y a exposition au virus dans une école, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures.

Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 31 octobre 2021.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation (NSLC) released its second-quarter financial results today, October 26, for July 5 to October 3, 2021.

Total sales for the quarter were up 5.1 per cent with an increase in both beverage alcohol and cannabis sales. This was driven by extra selling days compared to the same quarter last year, increased store hours due to pandemic restrictions last year, and the addition of 18 new cannabis stores.

There was a 0.8 per cent increase in earnings this fiscal quarter to $78.4 million.

There was a 7.3 per cent increase in the number of store transactions and a 1.4 per cent decrease in the average dollar value of each transaction, indicating a continued gradual return to pre-pandemic purchasing patterns.

Nova Scotia products experienced growth across all categories with local cannabis leading that growth with a 31.6 per cent increase in sales to $5.5 million. Nova Scotia wine sales grew by 28.5 per cent to $4.7 million compared to the previous fiscal quarter. Local craft beer sales grew 22.9 per cent to $7.7 million. Nova Scotia spirits sales increased by 19.6 per cent to $3.2 million and ready-to-drink sales grew by 3.4 per cent to $10 million.

-------------------------------------------------------
Community groups can move forward with projects that help promote healthier communities, improve infrastructure and foster economic growth with a $2.1 million investment from the Province.

The funding includes $1.5 million for 40 projects through the Recreational Facility Development grant program. These funds help community groups, municipalities and other not-for-profit organizations develop recreation and sport facilities.

For example, the Parrsboro Community Playground Society is building a new, inclusive community park and playground where the town hall once stood and received a grant of $85,000. The Municipality of the County of Cumberland is also providing $100,000 toward the project and has partnered with the society to build, manage and maintain the new playground.

The River Hebert/Joggins and Area Development Association will use its $85,000 grant to renovate the former Brookside Curling Club in River Hebert to become an accessible community centre for the surrounding communities.

“At the core of every healthy community are places where people can come together to be active,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables and the Cumberland South MLA, on behalf of Pat Dunn, Minister of Communities, Culture, Tourism and Heritage. “Trails and recreation facilities contribute significantly to our communities and enable Nova Scotians to access services and lead healthy, active lifestyles.”

The government is also contributing $650,000 to 20 projects through the Recreational Trail Expansion grant program. This funding will help communities develop, expand and upgrade trails across the province.

Quotes:
“I’d like to take the opportunity to thank the Province for its contribution towards an accessible, inclusive community park and playground in Parrsboro. In an area which suffers from one of the highest child poverty rates in our province and higher than average disability rate, this project has a magnified importance. Accessible and free recreation facilities are crucial to the well being of our community and we are so thankful the Province of Nova Scotia has helped us make it a reality.”
     - Matthew Brewer, Chair, Parrsboro Community Playground Society

“Our new community centre will provide much needed space for sports activities, after school programs, fitness classes for all ages and much more. The centre will also provide internet access to people in our community and will serve as a warming centre during winter power outages. A project of this scope would not be possible without this assistance, the efforts of our fundraising committee and the support of our whole community.”
     - Deborah Metherel, Treasurer, River Hebert/Joggins and Area Development Association

Quick Facts:
-- the facility and trail grant programs provide recipients with up to one-third of the total capital cost of a project, to a maximum of $150,000
-- applications for next year’s grants will open in January
-- most recreation facilities and trails across Nova Scotia are operated by volunteer groups

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 25 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Un septuagénaire est mort dans le secteur de l'ouest. 

« Mes sincères condoléances à la famille et aux proches de la personne décédée, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. La COVID-19 est toujours présente dans notre province. Faites-vous vacciner, restez à la maison si vous êtes malade et continuez de respecter les protocoles en matière de santé publique. »

La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 57 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 63 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 22 octobre.

Il y a 29 cas dans le secteur du centre, 17 dans le secteur du nord, 10 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 1 dans le secteur de l'est.

« Il est toujours difficile d'apprendre qu'une personne est décédée en raison de la COVID-19. Mes pensées et mes prières accompagnent ceux et celles qui sont en deuil, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. En nous faisant vacciner, non seulement nous nous protégeons nous-mêmes, mais nous protégeons aussi nos proches. Je conseille vivement à tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse de recevoir les deux doses du vaccin et de continuer de faire le nécessaire pour se protéger les uns les autres. »

Cinq patients dans une unité non désignée pour la COVID-19 à l'hôpital régional Valley de Kentville ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Une personne est aux soins intensifs à l'hôpital. La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse continue de tester les patients, le personnel et les médecins qui ont eu des contacts étroits avec les cas confirmés. Par mesure de précaution, la Régie a mis les tests de dépistage à la disposition du personnel et des médecins qui veulent se faire tester.

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé quatre écoles d'une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 152 cas actifs de COVID-19. Onze personnes sont hospitalisées dans des unités de traitement de la COVID-19, dont deux aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 2 269 tests le 22 octobre, 2 599 tests le 23 octobre et 2 056 tests le 24 octobre.

Au 24 octobre, 1 562 774 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 755 858 étaient une deuxième dose, et 1 037 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 369 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et cinq décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 212. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 25, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 70s in Western Zone has died. 

“My heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of the man who has passed,” said Premier Tim Houston. “COVID-19 is still in our province. Please get vaccinated, stay home if you are sick and continue to follow public health protocols.”

Nova Scotia is also reporting 57 new cases of COVID-19 and 63 recoveries since the last update on October 22.

There are 29 cases in Central Zone, 17 cases in Northern Zone, 10 cases in Western Zone and one case in Eastern Zone.

“It is never easy to hear that a Nova Scotian has passed away as a result of COVID-19. My thoughts and prayers are with those who are grieving,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. “Getting vaccinated will not only protect you but also your loved ones and your community. I encourage all Nova Scotians to get both doses and keep doing all you can to protect each other.”

Five patients in a non-COVID unit at Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville have tested positive for COVID-19. One person is in intensive care at the hospital. Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) continues to test patients, staff and doctors identified as close contacts. As a precaution, NSHA has made testing available for staff and doctors on site who want to get tested.

Over the past three days, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 152 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 11 people are in hospital, including two in ICU.

Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 2,269 tests on October 22; 2,599 tests on October 23; and 2,056 tests on October 24.

As of October 24, 1,562,774 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 755,858 Nova Scotians have received their second dose and 1,037 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 1,369 positive COVID-19 cases and five deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 1,212 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 31, 2021

"Health and Wellness","Innovative Urgent Treatment Centre to open in Cape Breton","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Innovative Urgent Treatment Centre to open in Cape Breton
----------------------------------------------------
Starting November 1, Nova Scotians living in North Sydney and surrounding communities in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality will have a new option to get urgent healthcare treatment close to home.

The Northside Urgent Treatment Centre, located in the Northside General Hospital, will provide care for those with unexpected, non-life-threatening health concerns that require same or next day treatment. Some examples include simple fractures, sprains, earaches, minor cuts and mild mental health support. The centre is available to people with or without a family doctor or nurse practitioner.

“This is a new way of offering care to Nova Scotians and the goal is to improve access to healthcare when and where people need it,” Premier Tim Houston said today, October 25, at the centre. “We know change is needed in our healthcare system, and we have to find new and better ways to provide care. This urgent treatment centre moves us in the right direction.”

The centre will differ from an emergency department in several ways: care provided is for non-life-threatening injuries and illness; ambulances do not bring patients to the centre; and patients must make an appointment (usually, either same day or next day). Patients requiring emergency care should continue to call 911.

Nova Scotia Health will be hosting a public education session about the new centre on Thursday, October 28, at the Emera Centre Northside at 6 p.m. Due to COVID-19 gathering limits, registration is required. Registration information for the session will be available from Nova Scotia Health soon.

Quotes:
“We need to ensure Nova Scotians have as much access to primary care as possible using new and innovative models. The Northside Urgent Treatment Centre came about after looking at what other jurisdictions are doing, and I would like to thank all the people who worked on this and their thinking outside the box.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“We know we need to do things differently and are excited about rolling out this new model of care. We believe the Northside Urgent Treatment Centre will provide much-needed access to non-emergency care to Northside residents and those in nearby communities, which is welcome news to our staff, physicians and patients.”
     - Duane Jessome, Manager, Northside Urgent Treatment Centre

“For the past year, our team of nurses, Nova Scotia Health staff, patient representatives and physicians have been looking closely at urgent care options across Canada. We know this is a great need in our community, and we are very excited to announce this particular model. It will allow us to provide a great service to our patients and better meet the needs of patients, families, and the Northside community.”
     - Dr. Joan Salah, Primary Healthcare Physician Co-Lead, Eastern Zone, Nova Scotia Health

“We needed to think outside the box to get people the right care at the right time and the Northside Urgent Treatment Centre model is a good example of that. With a set schedule, we are now able to give the people in our community certainty about where and when to go for care. The physicians who will be working in the centre are excited to use their existing skills and training to enable better access for urgent healthcare needs.”
     - Dr. Stephanie Langley, Physician Co-Lead, Primary Health Care, Eastern Zone, Nova Scotia Health

About the Northside Urgent Treatment Centre:
The centre will operate Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., and Saturdays from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Hours are subject to change on holidays. Patients can book an appointment starting at 8:30 a.m. on November 1 by calling 902-794-8966 or going to the centre in person, where they will be assessed by a nurse to determine if they will be scheduled for an appointment, usually later that day or the next day.

Quick Facts: 
-- as part of the CBRM Healthcare Redevelopment Project, a new health centre, laundry facility and long-term care home will be built in the Northside Business Park; early construction and site preparations are now underway
-- the Northside Urgent Treatment Centre will eventually be moved to the new health centre
-- the Northside General Hospital will remain open until the new health centre is operational

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Tree for Boston, a deeply rooted tradition in Nova Scotia for the last 50 years, is making its trek from Inverness County this year.

The 60-year-old, 48-foot white spruce was donated by landowner L’Arche Cape Breton, a non-profit organization that creates safe, supportive homes and meaningful work for people with disabilities.

“The Tree for Boston has been a symbol of appreciation, friendship and unity for 50 years,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “We will never forget the kindness the people of Boston showed Nova Scotia following the tragedy of the Halifax Explosion.”

The tree-cutting ceremony will be held on November 10 on L’Arche Cape Breton’s property in Orangedale, Inverness Co. Members of the L’Arche community will attend to help celebrate the annual tradition.

Due to the pandemic, the Province is partnering with Port of Halifax, container terminal PSA Halifax and transportation company Eimskip Canada to transport the tree on a container vessel. The tree will leave Halifax on November 15 and be delivered to its new home on Boston Common within days.

Quotes:
“The annual tradition of the Tree for Boston is something near and dear to all Nova Scotians. It represents how thankful we are to the people of Boston for being there for us when we needed it most. I am so proud that this year’s tree is coming from Inverness County, donated by an organization that does so much in our community.”
     - Allan MacMaster, Deputy Premier and MLA for Inverness

“In response to the explosion in 1917, Boston extended a hand of friendship to Halifax, which was accepted with open arms and returned with an endless thanksgiving through the Tree for Boston. This connects deeply with us in L’Arche. In the service of our mission, we aspire to build the same values of relationship and gratitude every day.”
     - Mukthar Limpao, Executive Director and Community Leader, L’Arche Cape Breton 

Quick Facts:

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 22 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 23 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 26 rétablissements.

Il y a 13 cas dans le secteur du centre, 6 dans le secteur de l’ouest, 3 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l’est.

Cinq patients dans une unité non désignée pour la COVID-19 à l’hôpital régional Valley de Kentville ont obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Une personne est aux soins intensifs à l’hôpital. La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse continue de tester les patients, le personnel et les médecins qui ont eu des contacts étroits avec les cas confirmés. Par mesure de précaution, la Régie a mis les tests de dépistage à la disposition du personnel et des médecins qui veulent se faire tester.

Le 21 octobre, on a avisé les responsables de deux écoles d’une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Il y a eu 77 cas de COVID-19 avec une date d’épisode des cas du 14 au 20 octobre. De ce nombre :

-- 23 personnes (29,9 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (3,9 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 51 personnes (66,2 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

Il y a eu 5 506 cas du 15 mars au 20 octobre. De ce nombre :

-- 324 personnes (5,9 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 353 personnes (6,4 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 4 829 personnes (87,7 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 304 personnes ont été hospitalisées. De ce nombre :

-- 11 personnes (3,6 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 30 personnes (9,9 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 263 personnes (86,5 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 32 personnes sont décédées. De ce nombre :

-- 3 personnes (9,4 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (9,4 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 26 personnes (81,3 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 160 cas actifs de COVID-19. Quinze personnes sont hospitalisées, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 26 384 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 15 au 21 octobre. Cela comprend 2 775 tests de dépistage rapide dans les cliniques temporaires d’Halifax et de Dartmouth, et 23 609 tests rapides administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. De plus, 12 741 tests rapides à faire à la maison ont été distribués dans les cliniques temporaires.

Le 21 octobre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé 2 780 tests.

Au 21 octobre, 1 558 391 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 753 331 étaient une deuxième dose, et 796 étaient une troisième dose, offerte aux personnes admissibles.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 312 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et quatre décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 148. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref

There are 13 cases in Central Zone, six cases in Western Zone, three cases in Northern Zone and one case in Eastern Zone.

Five patients in a non-COVID unit at Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville have tested positive for COVID-19. One person is in intensive care at the hospital. Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) continues to test patients, staff and doctors identified as close contacts. As a precaution, NSHA has made testing available for staff and doctors on site who want to get tested.

On October 21, two schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

There have been 77 cases of COVID-19 with an episode date between October 14 and October 20. Of those:

-- 23 (29.9 per cent) were fully vaccinated

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 31, 2021

"Municipal Affairs and Housing","More Planning Powers for Municipal Governments","MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS/HOUSING--More Planning Powers for Municipal Governments 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Municipalities need the flexibility to improve incentives and remove barriers to building affordable housing in their communities, where it is needed most. 

The government is making changes to the Municipal Government Act and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter to provide local governments with more planning powers to address affordable housing needs in their communities.

The amendments mean municipalities can require affordable housing in a new development within municipal boundaries.

“We need more safe, affordable housing for Nova Scotians,” said John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Inclusionary zoning is one tool municipalities can use to help make that happen.”

The changes were introduced on October 20 in the Nova Scotia legislature.

Quotes:
“This legislation will enable municipalities to use inclusionary zoning in their municipal planning strategies. NSFM believes this is the beginning of what needs to be a sustained, collaborative discussion on how to best address the housing crisis through municipal-provincial partnership.”
     - Emily Lutz, President, Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities
 
Quick Facts:
-- the change was requested by Halifax Regional Municipality but will be available to all municipalities
-- inclusionary zoning is a planning tool that municipalities can use to create opportunities for affordable housing development
-- inclusionary zoning was part of the government’s housing plan announced on October 20

----------------------------------------------------------------
Grants awarded through the Mineral Resources Development Fund support the search for new mineral deposits, help get new mining projects underway and attract investment to Nova Scotia. 

Natural Resources and Renewables Minister Tory Rushton announced new grants totalling over $1.3 million for 44 projects today, October 22. 

“Our mining industry plays an important role in Nova Scotia’s economy,” said Minister Rushton. “These grants help prospectors, mineral exploration companies, academics and students grow our mining sector and develop more innovative and sustainable practices in the field.” 

The fund supports mineral exploration programs, university research, training and professional development. 

Quotes:
""Over the years I have come to realize that mineral exploration is a continually evolving experience despite your level of involvement in the industry. Whether it’s new minerals being sought, new exploration tools, unique ways of networking or challenges to overcome, it all takes financial support. The Mineral Resources Development Fund has allowed me to collect important new information on exploration projects which have the potential for a mineral resource discovery.""
     - Henry Schenkels, prospector

""The continued support from the program has provided us the opportunity to explore new targets for critical minerals at Bass River. We are grateful for the government’s involvement as our team works hard towards bringing economic development to rural Nova Scotia.""

----------------------------------------------------------------
Amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act concerning impaired driving, bicycle traffic lights and muffler noise will help improve road safety for all users.

Changes introduced today, October 22, will allow municipalities and the Province to install traffic control signals for bicycles and authorize municipalities to create bylaws for muffler noise. The changes will also confirm that police officers have the authority to issue a 90-day suspension to anyone who fails or refuses to comply with a demand to take a test related to impairment.

“We want to ensure that our roads are safe for all users,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “Today’s changes enabling the installation of bicycle traffic signals will improve bicycle infrastructure and help municipalities enhance their cycling networks. As well, municipalities will now have the authority to address the common concern of muffler noise.”

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia's Motor Vehicle Act is outdated and being replaced with a new, modern Traffic Safety Act that will help make the province's roads and highways safer
-- the Traffic Safety Act is expected to take three to four years to be proclaimed
-- before the Traffic Safety Act is proclaimed, time-sensitive amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act will allow projects and initiatives important to key stakeholders to move forward

Aujourd'hui 21 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 19 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 21 rétablissements.

Il y a neuf cas dans le secteur du nord, huit dans le secteur du centre et deux dans le secteur de l'ouest.

Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Un cinquième patient dans une unité non désignée pour la COVID-19 à l'hôpital régional Valley de Kentville a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Une personne est aux soins intensifs à l'hôpital.

Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","19 New Cases of COVID-19, 21 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--19 New Cases of COVID-19, 21 Recoveries 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 21, Nova Scotia is reporting 19 new cases of COVID-19 and 21 recoveries.

There are nine cases in Northern Zone, eight cases in Central Zone and two cases in Western Zone.

There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

A fifth patient in a non-COVID unit at Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville has tested positive for COVID-19. One person is in intensive care at the hospital. Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) continues to test patients, staff and doctors identified as close contacts. As a precaution, NSHA has made testing available for staff and doctors on site who want to get tested.

On October 20, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 163 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 15 people are in hospital, including five in ICU.

On October 20, NSHA’s labs completed 3,648 tests.

As of October 20, 1,555,823 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 751,916 Nova Scotians have received their second dose and 481 eligible Nova Scotians have received a third dose.

Since August 1, there have been 1,289 positive COVID-19 cases and four deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 1,122 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 31, 2021

"Labour, Skills and Immigration","Amendments to Fair Registration Practices Act Reduce Red Tape for Regulators","LABOUR/SKILLS/IMMIGRATION--Amendments to Fair Registration Practices Act Reduce Red Tape for Regulators
----------------------------------------------------------------
Proposed amendments to the Fair Registration Practices Act (FRPA) will help simplify administrative requirements for regulatory bodies and professional associations so they can spend more time on their work serving the public. These changes are the first significant changes made to the act since it came into effect in 2008.

“Regulatory bodies and professional associations are staffed by dedicated Nova Scotians who work hard to support their membership,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “We listened to their feedback and conducted research to find ways to cut down on time-consuming paperwork and make it easier to conduct their work overseeing regulatory requirements for their industry.”

The proposed amendments apply to sections 15 and 16 of the act and will reduce and clarify the information regulatory bodies must include in review reports, non-compliant action plans and annual registration information. It will also extend the time to submit review reports from two to five years.

A regulatory body oversees and sets the standards for specific industries and practices. Everyone who works in a provincially regulated occupation must be registered with a regulatory body. These may be professional associations, boards or societies. They are responsible for a broad range of services, such as professional practices, safety, labour market issues, and skills and learning. 

Quotes:
“The changes to the Fair Registration Practices Act will decrease the workload while still safeguarding the system. The change from two to five years for the reporting requirements is a positive step forward and is similar to most professional accreditation review schedules. Having completed yearly reports for FRPA, I can say that the new format and questions are less repetitive and still provide the useful information that the Province will need to evaluate the health of the specific profession.”
     - Louis LeBel, Executive Director, TechNova, Society of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists

“NSCCT is fully supportive of the planned legislative amendments to the FRPA. The improvements introduced to the process between the last two reporting periods in terms of clarifying requirements and enhancing reporting efficiency were welcomed by the college and well worth codifying within the legislative framework itself. From our perspective, stretching the intervals between reports for regulators who have proven to be substantially compliant would offer the advantage of allowing time for ongoing internal review and evaluation of registration processes to help incorporate the principles of FRPA further into the culture of the regulator.”
     - John Hubert, Executive Director and Registrar, Nova Scotia College of Counselling Therapists

“Cosmetology is a continuously evolving industry and, in more recent years, has seen an enormous influx of immigrants to Nova Scotia requesting licensing in one cosmetology skill or another. On average, the Cosmetology Association has upwards of 150 applicants per year from out of province or country. Prior to the proposed amendments, the association had some difficulty in reporting as a vast majority of the association’s members hold more than one licence in cosmetology. Simplifying reporting requirements will greatly assist reporting in this area. The Cosmetology Association will continue to ensure ease of access and provide alternate pathways to licensure with the Cosmetology Association of Nova Scotia.”
     - A.R. (Bobbi) Brooks, Legal Compliance Co-ordinator and Executive Assistant to the Executive Director, Cosmetology Association of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts: 
-- there are more than 47 regulating bodies in Nova Scotia, covering 59 occupations and 21 designated trades
-- the Fair Registration Practices Act was enacted in 2008 to ensure that regulating bodies have registration practices that are transparent, objective, impartial and procedurally fair
-- according to the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness, Nova Scotia has reduced the regulatory burden for businesses for net savings of $50 million annually
-- Canadian Small Business Week runs from October 17 to 23

"Health and Wellness","Le vaccin contre la grippe est maintenant offert en Nouvelle-Écosse","SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Le vaccin contre la grippe est maintenant offert en Nouvelle-Écosse
--------------------------------------------------------
Le vaccin contre la grippe saisonnière sera offert gratuitement par la plupart des pharmacies, des médecins de famille, des infirmières en milieu familial et des infirmières praticiennes à l'échelle de la province à compter du lundi 25 octobre. 

On encourage fortement toute personne de six mois ou plus à recevoir le vaccin antigrippal cette année afin de se protéger, de protéger leurs proches et de protéger leur communauté. 

Les effets du vaccin peuvent prendre jusqu'à deux semaines. Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse devraient se faire vacciner au cours des prochaines semaines pour assurer une bonne protection avant le début de la saison grippale, qui s'étend habituellement de la fin décembre au début janvier.

Les symptômes de la grippe incluent souvent une fièvre élevée et soudaine, un mal de tête, des douleurs générales, une fatigue et une faiblesse, une toux, une congestion nasale et un mal de gorge. Les gens qui présentent des symptômes de la grippe devraient rester à la maison. La grippe ne peut pas être contractée par le vaccin antigrippal.

Cette année, en raison des précautions prises dans le cadre de la COVID-19, le processus d'obtention du vaccin sera différent des années précédentes. Les changements peuvent inclure des questions préalables au sujet de toute maladie ou exposition à la COVID-19, les rendez-vous obligatoires, l'éloignement physique dans la mesure du possible et le port du masque à l'intérieur.

Il est tout à fait sécuritaire pour toute personne, y compris les jeunes de 12 ans ou plus, de recevoir le vaccin antigrippal avant, après ou avec le vaccin contre la COVID-19. Le vaccin contre la COVID-19 ne protège pas contre la grippe.

Des habitudes saines contribuent à la bonne santé de la province. Bien que la vaccination soit la mesure la plus importante qu'une personne puisse prendre pour prévenir la propagation de la grippe, il est tout de même important de maintenir les habitudes saines adoptées pendant la pandémie, par exemple se couvrir la bouche pour tousser et éternuer, se laver les mains souvent, nettoyer les surfaces, porter un masque, se réunir en toute sécurité, maintenir l'éloignement physique et rester à la maison en cas de maladie.

Citation
« En raison de la saison grippale et de la quatrième vague de COVID-19, il est important de maintenir les habitudes saines que nous avons adoptées pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Il faut d'abord et avant tout se faire vacciner pour se protéger et pour protéger nos proches. Mais il faut également continuer de respecter les mesures de santé publique qui ont été mises en place en raison de la COVID-19. » 
     - Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse 

Faits en bref
-- La Nouvelle-Écosse a commandé 495 200 doses du vaccin antigrippal cette année. 
-- Les adultes de plus de 65 ans, les enfants de six mois à cinq ans, les personnes enceintes, les personnes vivant dans des logements surpeuplés, les personnes de tout âge qui vivent dans un établissement de soins de longue durée et les personnes atteintes d'une maladie chronique sont plus à risque de souffrir de complications de la grippe.
-- Les personnes qui présentent des symptômes de la grippe devraient subir un test de dépistage de la COVID-19 puisque les symptômes de ces deux maladies sont semblables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The seasonal influenza vaccine will be available for free from most pharmacies, family doctors, family practice nurses and nurse practitioners across the province, starting Monday, October 25 . 

All Nova Scotians over six months old are highly encouraged to get a flu vaccine this year in order to protect themselves, their loved ones and our communities. 

It can take up to two weeks for the vaccination to provide protection. Nova Scotians should get vaccinated in the coming weeks to see the full benefit before flu season arrives, which is usually late December to early January.

Flu symptoms often include a sudden high fever; headache, general aches and pains; fatigue and weakness; cough, nasal congestion and sore throat. People with flu symptoms should stay at home. People cannot catch the flu from receiving the influenza vaccination.

This year, due to COVID-19 precautions, the process for getting the flu vaccine will be different than in previous years. Changes may include pre-screening for illness or exposure to COVID-19, requiring an appointment rather than accepting walk-ins, keeping physical distance whenever possible and wearing your mask indoors.

It is safe for individuals, including those age 12 and older to receive the flu vaccine before, after or even at the same time as receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccinations do not protect against the flu.

Healthier habits help make a healthier province. Although the vaccine is the most important action a person can take to prevent the spread of the flu, it is important to continue practicing the healthy habits developed throughout the pandemic, such as practicing proper coughing and sneezing etiquette, hand hygiene, cleaning surfaces, wearing masks, gathering safely, physical distancing and staying home when sick.

Quotes:
“With flu season coming, and the fourth wave of COVID-19 present, we need to continue the healthy habits we’ve learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. That means first and foremost getting your vaccine to protect yourself and loved ones. But it also means continuing to practice the same public health measures we’ve been using for COVID-19.” 
     - Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's Chief Medical Officer of Health.

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia has ordered 495,200 doses of the flu shot this year 
-- adults over 65, children six months to five years old, people who are pregnant, those residing in crowded living situations, people of any age who are residents of long-term care facilities and people with chronic illness are at a high risk of developing flu-related complications
-- people with flu symptoms should get tested for COVID-19 since the symptoms are similar for both illnesses

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 20 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale six nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et vingt-sept rétablissements.

Il y a trois cas dans le secteur du centre, deux dans le secteur de l’ouest et un dans le secteur du nord.

Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Un quatrième patient dans une unité non désignée pour la COVID au Valley Regional Hospital a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. Une personne est aux soins intensifs à l’hôpital. La Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse continue de tester les patients, le personnel et les médecins qui ont eu des contacts étroits avec le cas confirmé. Par mesure de précaution, la Régie a mis les tests de dépistage à la disposition du personnel et des médecins qui veulent se faire tester.

Le 19 octobre, on a avisé une école qu’il y a eu exposition au virus dans son établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures.  

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 165 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 16 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont cinq aux soins intensifs.

Le 19 octobre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé ont analysé 3 121 tests.

Au 19 octobre, 1 552 716 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 750 349 étaient une deuxième dose.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 270 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et quatre décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 101. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Since August 1, there have been 1,270 positive COVID-19 cases and four deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 1,101 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 31, 2021

"Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services","Amendments Strengthen Tenant Protections and Provide Clarity for Landlords","SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES--Amendments Strengthen Tenant Protections and Provide Clarity for Landlords
----------------------------------------------------------
New rules to protect tenants against renovation evictions are included in amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act that will be introduced today, October 20.

“We need to do more to protect tenants,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “The changes we have proposed are part of our government’s larger effort to protect tenants and address the housing challenges in the province. Our work is just beginning, and we intend to bring more changes forward in the future.”

The proposed amendments address the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission’s recommendation to modernize provincial legislation to enhance renter protections against evictions due to renovations. The measures include:
-- tenants will be given a minimum of three months notice before they can be evicted due to renovations
-- mutual agreements to terminate a lease between tenants and landlords must be in writing 
-- if a tenant does not agree to terminate the tenancy, landlords must make an application under the Province’s residential tenancies program for an eviction order
-- landlords must give the tenant between one and three months rent as compensation for the eviction 
-- landlord violations of the new protections can lead to additional compensation for tenants such as covering moving expenses or paying the difference between the tenant’s new unit and the rent paid for their former unit, for up to one year.

Other tenant protections in the bill include:
-- rental increase notices can only contain one amount, regardless of whether the tenant decides to renew their tenancy as a month-to-month or yearly lease
-- landlords cannot charge different rental rates for different lease terms
-- a streamlined security deposit claim process so it is easier for tenants to get back their security deposits
-- landlords must provide a 24-hour written notice to enter tenants’ units unless the tenant gives permission or there is an emergency.

Changes that will increase efficiency and provide clarity around processes for landlords include: 
-- flexible effective dates for rental increase notices that are no longer tied to an anniversary date; such notices are still limited to once a year
-- when a tenant’s dispute of a rental eviction notice is dismissed, an eviction order can be issued.

Amendments to strengthen tenant protections against renovation evictions, will come into effect upon Royal Assent. Other amendments will take effect at a later date.

Quick Facts:
-- the current ban on evictions due to renovations will end on February 1, 2022, or at the end of the provincial state of emergency, whichever is sooner

----------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone deserves a home to call their own. Having a place to live brings with it stability, security and a sense of belonging. The Province is taking action to help those experiencing homelessness by investing $10.1 million over two years to provide wrap-around supports, shelter and culturally relevant housing across Nova Scotia. 

“These investments will create greater stability in the Province’s shelter system and move us toward a more preventative approach, with a goal of more permanent housing and shelter for people across the province,” said Karla MacFarlane, Minister of Community Services. “We could not do any of this without our dedicated community partners – their work is often difficult, yet their commitment, kindness and tenacity has been unwavering.”

Investments over the next two years include:
-- $4.2 million to various organizations across the province to maintain emergency shelter investments created during the COVID-19 pandemic
-- $1.6 million for the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre for Diamond Bailey House, an Indigenous supportive housing initiative in Halifax. An additional $76,000 will be provided in the first year for start-up costs
-- $1.3 million for emergency, short-term hotel stays and 24/7 wrap-around supports for individuals temporarily living in hotels
-- $931,000 to support people transitioning out of correctional facilities. This includes funding for the John Howard Society and the Elizabeth Fry Society of Mainland Nova Scotia
-- $713,000 annually to Shelter Nova Scotia to stabilize operations
-- $630,000 to Adsum for Women and Children to launch a Diverting Families program in East Preston and to pilot the program for Nova Scotians living in Shelburne, Yarmouth and Digby. The Diverting Families program will work directly with families who are in crisis due to homelessness or impending homelessness.

Over the two years of these investments, the government will work closely with community partners and other levels of government to be responsive to the needs of vulnerable, homeless or precariously housed families and individuals. Future investments will be driven by the changing housing market, feedback from stakeholders and partners, and the needs of Nova Scotians across the province. 

Quotes:
“The Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Society is excited to see the continued investments for the urban Indigenous community in regard to addressing the chronic homelessness issues facing our community. These investments will support several of the calls to action identified in the Truth and Reconciliation report. We look forward to working with the Province on addressing the chronic housing crisis facing us all.”
     - Pam Glode-Desrouchers, Executive Director, Mi'kmaw Native Friendship Society

Quick Facts:
-- according to the By-Name List, as of October 19, 2021, there were approximately 409 people in the Halifax Regional Municipality who are currently experiencing homelessness
-- the provincial Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness (IAP) was launched in February 2020 in an effort to address some of these issues: https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20200226001
-- during the initial waves of COVID-19, temporary measures were implemented to address pandemic impacts on homelessness, including additional shelter beds
-- in May 2021, investments were made to provide permanent supportive housing options that will offer wraparound services for homeless people with complex needs and significant barriers to securing permanent housing

The Province will spend nearly $35 million to support over 1,100 new affordable housing units in communities throughout Nova Scotia and make 425 new rent supplements available immediately.

“We want people to have a place to live that is safe and affordable,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We are moving forward with several initiatives that will see Nova Scotians have access to affordable housing. We know we need to do more, and we are.”

The government has identified new construction projects in several communities across the province. Specific project announcements will be made when details and agreements have been finalized with partners.

These initiatives are part of the recommendations by the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission to build new units to support community housing for lower income and vulnerable people.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotia needs more affordable housing units to address the housing crisis. We’re moving forward with projects that will see new affordable housing units in our province, along with rent supplements that will help people right now.”
     - John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing

“There is an urgent and ongoing need to increase affordable housing. Nova Scotia can solve its affordable housing crisis and we’re encouraged to see this work towards the recommendations of the Affordable Housing Commission. As rental rates continue to go up and vacancies decline in Cape Breton, creating enough safe, accessible, dignified affordable housing is more important than ever.”
     - Erika Shea, CEO, New Dawn Enterprises Ltd.

“We are pleased with today’s announcement that the Province is committed to the growth of affordable housing. Housing co-operatives provide affordable, safe housing to low and moderate-income households and are a key part of the solution. CHF Canada looks forward to working with the Province of Nova Scotia to advance our shared goal of ensuring secure, affordable housing for all Nova Scotians.""
     - Karen Brodeur, Regional Manager Atlantic for the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada and member of the Nova Scotia Affordable Housing Commission

Quick Facts:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Affordable, safe housing is crucial for a healthy society, quality of life, attracting new residents, social equity and growing the economy. Nova Scotia needs to build more housing and the Province is taking steps to get more homes built quickly.

“The housing crisis is real and Nova Scotians expect us to act,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We’ll do what needs to be done to make sure Nova Scotians can afford a place to call home. We will not wait.”

Creating more affordable housing will take time. In the coming weeks, the Province will introduce interim residential rent-cap legislation to protect tenants once the state of emergency ends. This will limit residential rent increases to 2 per cent per year and will be in effect until December 31, 2023, while more supply is built. 

The government will spend nearly $35 million to support over 1,100 new affordable housing units across the province. 

During this House session, the government will introduce legislation to create a planning task force to focus on faster planning and development approvals for large residential projects in HRM. 

Employers say they’re having trouble finding enough skilled tradespeople. The Province will work to recruit and retain more apprentices, and review the training ratio for apprentices to create more opportunities for them and ease the skilled labour shortage. The government will also eliminate the provincial portion of personal income tax on the first $50,000 of annual income for construction trades workers under the age of 30. 

Increasing student housing is another important way to help relieve the overall community housing shortage. The Province will build new residences at three NSCC campuses and create a province-wide student housing strategy.

The planning task force chair will be appointed by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and membership will come from the Province and the municipality. It will focus on analyzing and approving large residential developments in the Halifax area.

The Province is identifying a list of provincially-owned properties that can be used for housing. Staff will work with community groups, municipalities and others to get projects underway on these lands as quickly as possible. 

The Province will also create a regional transportation group, including engineers and planners from the municipality and the Province, to create a master transportation plan for HRM. This group will review roads, ferries and public transit to ensure the transportation system is set up for rapid residential growth in the coming years.

Inclusionary zoning, a planning tool that requires or encourages affordable housing in a new development, will be added to the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter and the Municipal Government Act this House session. 

The Province will also meet with municipalities across the province to discuss other possible measures that will support affordable housing, such as better regulation for short-term rental units and flexibility in taxation to encourage development.

Quotes:
“We can’t solve the affordable housing crisis without building more places for people to live. We will work with HRM to quickly approve new developments, so more people have a safe place to live in our province’s largest city.”
     - John Lohr, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing

“We’ve heard from many Nova Scotians who are worried they won’t be able to afford their rent when the state of emergency ends. This interim rental cap will help keep those people housed while we work on long-term solutions.”
     - Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services

“This is great news for our students. We look forward to working with government to increase housing options near our campuses.”
     - Don Bureaux, President, Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)

Quick Facts:
-- as of July 1, Nova Scotia’s population had increased from 942,970 to 992,055 over the last five years

----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province continues to give the debt collection industry more flexibility, with amendments to the Collection and Debt Management Agencies Act introduced today, October 19.

Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services Minister Colton LeBlanc introduced the amendments, which will allow debt management agents and individual collectors to continue to contact and work with Nova Scotians remotely, from home.

“These amendments will help modernize our legislation while also bringing our industry in line with practices across the country,” said Minister LeBlanc. “Employees working in the industry have proven they can work responsibly and effectively from home during the pandemic and we would like to allow them to continue to do so, as they have requested.”

Since March 2020, debt collectors within and outside the province have been allowed to temporarily work from home when contacting people living in Nova Scotia. The temporary measures were put in place to help keep employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Along with the amendments, requirements that focus on consumers’ privacy and protection will be introduced later.

Quick Facts:
-- there are over 60 licensed collection and debt management agencies conducting business in Nova Scotia and about 2,000 individual collectors and debt management agents
-- Nova Scotia is one of two provinces in Canada that typically do not allow those in the collections industry to work from home

"Economic Development","Minister’s Statement on Small Business Week","ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT--Minister’s Statement on Small Business Week
------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a statement read in the legislature today, October 19, by Economic Development Minister Susan Corkum-Greek
--------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to officially recognize and acknowledge Small Business Week in Nova Scotia.

We need and value the significant contribution that businesses make to our communities and our economy. When they succeed, we succeed.

Small businesses are employers. They drive our economy forward by providing jobs for Nova Scotians.

Mr. Speaker, the past year and a half has presented challenges never seen before for all businesses. I want to thank this important sector for their commitment to work through these extraordinary circumstances.

COVID-19 continues to have real public health and economic impacts. But through it all, Nova Scotia businesses have been front and centre, making significant sacrifices to protect their employees, customers and communities in the fight against the global pandemic.

It meant changing the way they do business.

Mr. Speaker, the theme of Small Business Week 2021 is Digital Adoption.

During the pandemic, many consumer behaviours have changed, such as moving to online shopping, even when buying local.  That is why we are supporting businesses to pivot to the digital economy.

Many small businesses have already shifted, adapted and persevered.

Through uncertain times, the have demonstrated their resilience.

And proven that there is no better time to support local.

Mr. Speaker, our government wants money flowing around the economy to stay here.

We believe money spent locally benefits all of Nova Scotia.

Mr. Speaker, our government's made-in-Nova Scotia solutions to help grow the economy also include putting more money in employees' pockets by giving employers a choice of paying corporate taxes or increasing the pay of their workforce.

Small business owners are always learning, innovating and thinking creatively, and that will serve our province well when we emerge from the pandemic.

We know that supporting Nova Scotia businesses during COVID-19 is a critical part of helping them emerge in a strong position and will support Nova Scotia’s economic recovery.

Mr. Speaker, we live in a province where anything is possible. I want to acknowledge the team at Meta Materials on their recent huge milestone. This market “win” demonstrates that world-class companies, technologies and teams are being built here in Nova Scotia.

Mr. Speaker, we can do even more.  We will work to support innovation-driven, green and sustainable businesses.

Our government will listen to small businesses across the province and in all sectors to get their feedback on all potential ways to further support them in taking actions to reduce emissions, including through rebates, targeted investments and other supports.

Mr. Speaker, our government is focused and committed over the next four years to give everything we have to make life better for our business community and all Nova Scotians.

We have our challenges … but we have such incredible opportunities.

Working together, we can get the job done.

Our government will listen, will respect, and will work with our business community to put Nova Scotia in a better place than we were before the pandemic.

Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Nova Scotians to continue to support and respect small businesses in their own backyard while we work together to beat the pandemic’s fourth wave.

Thank you.

"Health and Wellness / Seniors and Long-Term Care","Province Begins Hiring Nurse Practitioners","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Province Begins Hiring Nurse Practitioners
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is investing $2.5 million to increase the number of nurse practitioners working in long-term care.

This new funding will be used to hire at least 13 new nurse practitioners who will provide much-needed support to long-term care facilities across the province. The new nurse practitioners will work with existing facility teams and family physicians to diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret tests, prescribe medications and perform some medical procedures for long-term care residents. 

They will work in multiple long-term care facilities and also serve people in the surrounding community who do not have a family doctor or access to a nurse practitioner. 

“Older Nova Scotians deserve dignity and higher levels of care, and we can’t do that without a skilled workforce and facilities with the right staffing levels,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “This is only the first step of the hiring we need to do to fix healthcare for seniors and provide more care for thousands of people.”

These new hires will help address the gap identified by Nova Scotia Health in nurse practitioner support in long-term care facilities across the province. Adding more nurse practitioners will also relieve other pressures in the healthcare and long-term care systems, such as reducing ambulance transfers, emergency room visits and long-term care admission delays.

Quotes:
“Nova Scotians have told us access to primary care is one of their top concerns, and we know seniors need higher levels of care as they age. These are two of our top concerns, as well. This is an example of action we’re taking to hire more healthcare professionals, so we can improve access to care for more Nova Scotians.”
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

“This is fantastic news. It’s another positive step forward to improving the quality of life for long-term care residents, as well as supporting the on-site care teams and health system. It’s a win-win.”
     - Cheryl Smith, Long-Term Care Expert Panel Member and Nurse Practitioner

“Nurse practitioners are an important member of the health care team in long term care facilities and have been shown to improve the health outcomes of residents. As we continue to focus on collaborative team-based care, this addition of more than a dozen nurse practitioners will contribute to the overall quality and comprehensiveness of care that is being provided.”
     - Gail Tomblin Murphy, Vice-President of Research, Innovation and Discovery, and Chief Nurse Executive, Nova Scotia Health

Quick Facts:
-- this investment stems from the work of the Long-Term Care Expert Panel to develop a sector-wide strategy for primary care coverage
-- there are currently 29 nurse practitioners employed by Nova Scotia Health working in long-term care in the province
-- the number of seats in Dalhousie University’s Nurse Practitioner program has recently increased from 15 to 40
-- Nova Scotia Health will lead the recruiting and hiring process, working with physicians and the long-term care sector

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 265 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et quatre décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 1 074. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs),
-- un mal de tête,
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale,
-- un mal de gorge,
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 19, Nova Scotia is reporting 12 new cases of COVID-19 and 33 recoveries.

There are eight cases in Central Zone and four cases in Western Zone.

There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

The Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) is also reporting a small outbreak at Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville. Three patients in a non-COVID unit have tested positive for COVID-19. Two of the three cases are asymptomatic. One person is in intensive care. As a precaution, NSHA is testing other patients and staff identified as close contacts. NSHA will provide a further update when more information is available.

On October 18, three schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 187 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 14 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Le jour du Souvenir est l’occasion de rendre hommage aux personnes qui ont servi notre pays et à celles qui continuent de le faire.

Pour aider les propriétaires d’entreprises et leurs employés à observer cette journée tout en respectant la loi provinciale, un nouvel outil en ligne a été créé pour les aider à mieux comprendre comment la loi sur le jour du Souvenir (Remembrance Day Act) s’applique à leur entreprise. Le nouvel outil a été lancé aujourd’hui, 19 octobre, durant la Semaine de la petite entreprise.

« Les propriétaires d’entreprises nous ont dit qu’il n’était pas toujours facile de savoir s’ils pouvaient ouvrir le jour du Souvenir, a souligné Jill Balser, ministre du Travail, des Compétences et de l’Immigration. Ce nouvel outil en ligne apportera soutien et clarté aux entrepreneurs et aux employés tout en les aidant à prévoir le mieux possible comment souligner cette occasion. »

Le jour du Souvenir est un jour férié unique en Nouvelle-Écosse. La loi sur le jour du Souvenir précise quelles entreprises peuvent ouvrir le 11 novembre, elle fournit les règles à suivre concernant les jours fériés payés et elle exempte certaines entreprises des règles applicables.

Le nouvel outil en ligne est disponible ici : https://remembranceday.novascotia.ca/?lang=fr  

Citation
« Les lois peuvent souvent être complexes et difficiles à comprendre pour les petits entrepreneurs. Dans le cas du jour du Souvenir, les propriétaires de petites entreprises veulent s’assurer de faire les choses correctement pour leurs employés, leurs clients et les personnes qui ont servi notre pays. Nous sommes heureux que la Province prenne des mesures pour aider le milieu des affaires, notamment en lançant cet outil. »
     - Louis-Philippe Gauthier, directeur principal, Affaires législatives, Atlantique, Fédération canadienne de l’entreprise indépendante 

Faits en bref
-- La Semaine de la petite entreprise se déroule du 17 au 23 octobre.
-- L’outil concernant le jour du Souvenir est le fruit d’une collaboration entre les ministères suivants : Travail, Compétences et Immigration, Justice, et Service Nouvelle-Écosse et Services internes. Le Bureau de l'efficacité de la réglementation et des services a dirigé le projet.  
-- L’office a vu le jour en 2015 avec pour mandat d’évaluer, de mesurer et d’améliorer les règlements qui émanent du gouvernement, et ce, afin de réduire le fardeau global et excessif des règlements sur les entreprises, les citoyens et les autres groupes.

-------------------------------------------------
Remembrance Day is a time to pay respects and honour those who have served and those who continue to serve.

To help business owners and their employees observe this day while complying with provincial legislation, a new online tool has been created to clarify how the Remembrance Day Act applies to businesses. The new tool was launched today, October 19, during Small Business Week.

“Business owners have told us it isn’t always easy for them to know whether they can open on Remembrance Day,” said Jill Balser, Minister of Labour, Skills and Immigration. “This new online tool will provide support and clarity to businesses and employees while helping them plan how best to pay their respects.”

Remembrance Day is a unique holiday in Nova Scotia. The Remembrance Day Act outlines which businesses can operate on November 11, includes rules about holiday pay and exempts certain businesses from the rules altogether.

The new online tool is available at https://remembranceday.novascotia.ca/ 

Quotes:
""Legislation can often be complex and challenging for small businesses to understand. And in the case of Remembrance Day, small businesses want to make sure they are doing the right thing for their employees, their customers and for those who have served our country. We’re pleased that the Province is taking steps to support the business community through the introduction of this tool.”
     - Louis-Philippe Gauthier, Senior Director, Legislative Affairs, Atlantic, Canadian Federation of Independent Business

Quick Facts:
-- Canadian Small Business Week runs from October 17 to 23
-- the Remembrance Day tool is a collaboration of the Departments of Labour, Skills and Immigration; Justice; and Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services and led by the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness
-- the office was created in 2015 to assess, measure and improve government regulation, reducing the overall undue regulatory burden to business, citizens and other groups

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses across the province have had to adapt to new ways of doing things to stay open and keep Nova Scotians safe.

Small Business Week 2021 (October 17-23) is an opportunity to recognize the perseverance of small business owners and the significant contribution they make to the province.

“The past year and a half has presented challenges never seen before, and I want to thank entrepreneurs and their employees for working through these extraordinary times,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development. “Whether it was an alcohol distillery that started making small-batch hand sanitizer, restaurants that adopted touchless payment options or a local gift shop that moved their products online, small business owners came up with solutions to meet their customers’ needs. For that effort and innovation, I invite Nova Scotians to join me in celebrating Small Business Week by buying local whenever they can.”

This week, the government will be sharing stories about Nova Scotia businesses that have adapted the way they do business by using technology to connect with consumers, sell products and broaden their reach.

As part of fulfilling her mandate, the Minister of Economic Development will implement buy local approaches, attract and grow innovative, sustainable and green business start-ups and work with small businesses to support them in reducing emissions.

Quotes:
“Small businesses are anything but small when it comes to the impact they have on our economy and communities. These are the businesses that support our charities, give freely to fundraisers and children’s sport teams, and employ our friends and families. With such an overwhelming impact on our economy, it is so important for Nova Scotians to support local, especially local small businesses, during Small Business Week as well as year-round.”
     - Carla Arsenault, President and Chief Executive Officer, Cape Breton Partnership

“Small Business Week offers a great opportunity to highlight the impact so many enterprises have on our communities. Every day, countless entrepreneurs greet their team members, flip the open sign and get down to the business of building the economy right here at home in Nova Scotia. When I started the Soap Company of Nova Scotia Ltd., I made the conscious decision to grow it on the Eastern Shore. I also decided our number one value would be accessibility, meaning products are affordable for use on an ongoing daily basis and easily available. That’s why I fully embrace digital technology and am so grateful it allows me to live and work where I want to be, while still being out in the world.”
     - Leigh McFarlane, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, The Soap Company of Nova Scotia Ltd.

Quick Facts:
-- most Nova Scotia businesses are small businesses (1-99 employees)
-- small business makes up about 27 per cent of Nova Scotia’s GDP
-- approximately 24 per cent of the total payroll in Nova Scotia is from small business
-- the Internet for Nova Scotia Initiative seeks to connect all homes and businesses to reliable, high-speed internet, which will create new opportunities for entrepreneurs, wherever they live in the province

"Develop Nova Scotia","Peggy’s Cove Viewing Deck Opens","DEVELOP NOVA SCOTIA--Peggy’s Cove Viewing Deck Opens 
----------------------------------------------------------------
A new viewing deck along the Peggy’s Cove coastline opened today, October 18, with community members, guests and project partners on hand to celebrate. 

The 1,300 square metres (14,000 square feet) of new, accessible public space provides the opportunity to view the lighthouse, waves and rocks in a more attainable and safer way. The event included a smudge ceremony and opening prayer by representatives of the Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre. 

“This celebration recognizes the efforts of the community and partners and provides a new and inclusive way to experience Peggy’s Cove,” said Susan Corkum-Greek, Minister of Economic Development. “Infrastructure improvements like the viewing deck will enhance community well-being and the experience for many more visitors to this iconic Nova Scotia destination.” 

Over the past few years, Develop Nova Scotia worked closely with the community of Peggy’s Cove in a comprehensive master planning process which led to the phase one Implementation Plan that is nearing completion.

Announced in January 2021, the viewing deck project included a joint investment of $3.1 million from the Province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada. The project design team included Omar Gandhi Architect Inc., Harbourside Engineering and EDM Planning, with ongoing input from the community and Develop Nova Scotia.

Priorities of the implementation plan include climate change mitigation, increased parking, traffic and pedestrian routing and management, and public amenities.

A significant portion – 1,115 square metres (12,000 square feet) – of the deck was reclaimed for people from the existing roadway with the remaining extending slightly over the landscape and designed to blend in with the natural surroundings. Materials including wood and steel were used to complement the terrain. Visitors are still welcome to access the rocks and natural landscape. The project also includes one of two new planned public washrooms and improvements to trail connections that lead to the lighthouse and nearby parking area.

Additional provincial infrastructure investments of $6.2 million focus on pedestrian safety, traffic management, coastal protection, community sustainability, and resident and visitor experience in Peggy’s Cove. 

Over the past year, residents and visitors also saw a Visitor Information Centre parking lot expansion, revamp of the turnaround near the lighthouse, introduction of a parking management system, a new common area in the centre of the village with accessible public washrooms, and the restoration of the historic DeGarthe Studio. 

Quotes: 
“While Peggy’s Cove is a provincial icon and a highly visited destination, it is also, first and foremost, a community. We knew that if we could help bring residents’ vision to life in Peggy’s Cove, preserving what matters most, enhancing resilience and safety, telling the real stories, that not only would the community be more sustainable, but people – partners, visitors and all Nova Scotians, would be inspired. This viewing deck is the last part of a host of initiatives designed to do just that. We all believe that taking in this majestic cove up close is something everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy.”
     - Jennifer Angel, President and CEO, Develop Nova Scotia

“Peggy’s Cove, a treasured and timeless destination, is now accessible to people of all abilities with these beautiful, well-designed improvements. This is a wonderful project that respects its natural environment while inviting more people to enjoy it.”
     - Mike Savage, Mayor, Halifax Regional Municipality 

Quick Facts:
-- a village of 40, Peggy’s Cove welcomes 700,000 visitors in a typical year
-- the provincial investment of $1.7 million for the viewing deck was through the Tourism Revitalization of Icons Program (TRIP) administered by Tourism Nova Scotia
-- the Government of Canada, through the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), contributed $1.42 million toward the project through its Innovative Communities Fund

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse, recommande la fermeture de l'école Dartmouth South Academy à Dartmouth afin de contenir la propagation de la COVID-19.

L'école sera fermée aux élèves du 18 au 22 octobre pour prévenir la transmission du virus dans la communauté scolaire. L'école et les responsables de la Santé publique offriront des renseignements supplémentaires plus tard cette semaine sur la réouverture. Le directeur de l'école communiquera avec le personnel et les familles au sujet de l'apprentissage à la maison. Le centre de prématernelle, qui est situé dans un endroit séparé de l'école, restera ouvert. 

« Bien que notre objectif soit de maintenir l'apprentissage en classe, j'ai clairement indiqué que si des mesures plus rigoureuses étaient nécessaires, comme la fermeture d'une école, je n'hésiterais pas à agir, affirme le Dr Strang. L'équipe du médecin-hygiéniste régional surveille la situation de très près et recommande une fermeture temporaire pour contenir la propagation. »

L'unité mobile de dépistage de la Santé publique sera présente à l'école le lundi 18 octobre de 10 h à 17 h 30 et y retournera plus tard cette semaine. 

« Je comprends à quel point cette pandémie peut être stressante pour les familles et le personnel, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Je remercie les familles et le personnel qui respectent les mesures de santé publique et qui écoutent le docteur Strang et son équipe, qui continuent de prendre des décisions visant à assurer notre sécurité.  »

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, is recommending closure of Dartmouth South Academy in Dartmouth to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The school will be closed to students from October 18 to October 22 to prevent further spread of the virus among the school community. The school and public health will share more information later in the week about reopening plans. The principal will contact staff and families about learning from home. The pre-primary centre, which is located on a separate site from the school, will remain open. 

“While our goal is to keep students learning in the classroom, I was clear that if stronger measures were needed, like closing a school, we would not hesitate to act,” said Dr. Strang. “The regional medical officer of health team has been closely monitoring this situation and they are recommending a temporary closure to contain the spread.”

Public health’s mobile testing unit will be at the school Monday, October 18, from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and will return later in the week. 

“I understand and appreciate how stressful this pandemic can be on families and staff,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “I want to thank families and staff for following public health measures and for continuing to listen to Dr. Strang and his team. Dr. Strang and public health continue to make decisions that keep us safe.”

REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 15 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 18 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 17 rétablissements.

Il y a 12 cas dans le secteur du centre, 3 dans le secteur de l'ouest et 3 dans le secteur du nord.

Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Le 14 octobre, on a avisé deux écoles qu'il y a eu exposition dans leurs établissements. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Il y a eu 106 cas de COVID-19 du 7 au 13 octobre. De ce nombre :

-- 24 personnes (22,6 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 199 cas actifs de COVID-19. Quatorze personnes sont hospitalisées dans des unités de traitement de la COVID-19, dont une aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 29 673 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 8 au 14 octobre. Cela comprend 4 773 tests de dépistage rapide dans les cliniques temporaires d'Halifax et de Dartmouth, et 24 900 tests rapides administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. De plus, 17 853 tests rapides à faire à la maison ont été distribués dans les cliniques temporaires.

Le 14 octobre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 697 tests.

Au 14 octobre, 1 543 667 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 745 517 étaient une deuxième dose.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 181 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et quatre décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 978. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Le gouvernement provincial prolonge l'état d'urgence afin de protéger la santé et la sécurité des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et d'assurer la continuité des mesures de sécurité et d'autres mesures importantes. L'ordonnance prendra effet à midi le dimanche 17 octobre et sera en vigueur jusqu'à midi le dimanche 31 octobre, à moins que le gouvernement n'y mette fin ou la prolonge.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 31 octobre 2021.

The order will take effect at noon, Sunday, October 17, and extend to noon, Sunday, October 31, unless government terminates or extends it.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date.

"Economic Development","Two More Forestry Projects Funded; Next Round of Applications Opens","ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT--Two More Forestry Projects Funded; Next Round of Applications Opens 
-------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: This release is on behalf of the Forestry Innovation Transition Trust
-------------------------------------------------------
Two more projects, valued at more than $12 million, have been approved by the trustees of the Forestry Innovation Transition Trust.

The Family Forest Network is receiving more than $9.8 million for a multi-year project that will assist private woodlot owners in adopting and maintaining sustainable resource management practices through outreach, demonstration and research. The project will include a large-scale pilot of ecologically sensitive forest treatments in a wide range of woodlands across the province, with a special emphasis on restoring degraded stands to their natural diversity and productivity.

The network of 11 organizations reaches an estimated 12,590 small woodland owners. It was the first and largest group of forestry service providers to publicly endorse and practice the recommendations of the Independent Review of Forest Practices in Nova Scotia, commonly referred to as the Lahey report.

The Forestry Economic Task Force will receive more than $2.6 million to develop a roadmap to sustain and grow Nova Scotia’s forestry sector. The task force will oversee an industry-led, collaborative approach to identify key economic challenges, market trends and opportunities for the industry.

The trust is a $50 million fund focused on accelerating new opportunities within the Nova Scotia forestry sector to enhance environmental, social and economic values and the adoption of new ecological forestry practices. To date, the trust has approved nine projects for a total of $22.8 million.

The fund may be used by companies, organizations or post-secondary institutions working and researching in the forestry and biological resources sectors. Forestry workers may also seek funding to support training or retraining and can apply at any time. A three-member trustee board reviews the submissions and makes spending decisions.

The Trust also announced that the next round of applications will be accepted from October 15 until November 15.

An application guide and forms are online at https://novascotia.ca/forestry-trust/ 

Quotes:
“These two projects are exactly the type of initiatives the trust was established to fund. The large-scale pilot by the Family Forest Network, with strong support and buy-in from private woodland owners, will demonstrate how the approach towards sustainable forestry practices can be done with both economic and environmental benefits. The research by the Forestry Economic Task Force will identify opportunities for the sector, providing a roadmap to sustain and grow Nova Scotia’s forestry industry.”
     - Rosalind Penfound, Chair, Forestry Innovation Transition Trust

“This wide-ranging collaboration marks a new beginning for forest stewardship in Nova Scotia. Our project is firmly rooted in Mi’kmaw understanding about the interdependence of all living things, a perspective supported by a large body of research that demonstrates the value of forest practices that are based on natural processes and restore ecosystem diversity and resilience. This project will show the benefits of Lahey’s advice on small, private woodlands. In partnership with willing landowners, our harvesting pilot will provide a full accounting of both the short-term economics of ecological forestry and the long-term impact on forest value, carbon storage, biodiversity and other non-timber values.”
     - Andy Kekacs, Executive Director, Family Forest Network

“This initiative brings together a wide range of interests and businesses within the forestry sector. The trust’s investment will help to support the necessary economic and social research to create a plan for the sector to sustainably transition through market disruptions and identify new business and product opportunities.”
     - Allan Eddy, Chair, Forestry Economic Task Force

Quick Facts: 
-- the Family Forest Network will work with small-woodland owners and contractors on a collaborative approach to sustainable resource management; the trust received several applications to assist private woodlot owners and sponsored a facilitated session for sector organizations to support the development of a coordinated approach

"Education and Early Childhood Development","La Province va de l’avant avec le système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants","ÉDUCATION/DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA PETITE ENFANCE--La Province va de l’avant avec le système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants
------------------------------------------------------
La Nouvelle-Écosse poursuit ses efforts en vue d’offrir à toutes les familles des services de garde de jeunes enfants abordables, accessibles, de grande qualité et inclusifs.

Aujourd’hui 15 octobre, la Province a lancé un appel aux déclarations d’intérêt auprès des exploitants de garderies sans but lucratif et auprès de ceux qui assurent le Programme de prise en charge avant et après l’école de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La Province leur demande de lui indiquer dans quelle mesure ils sont intéressés à prendre de l’expansion puisqu’elle vise à créer 9 500 nouvelles places pour les enfants de moins de six ans, la priorité étant accordée aux localités où les besoins sont les plus criants pour certains services.

Cette démarche cadre avec l’intention de la Nouvelle-Écosse de réduire les frais de garde d’enfants de 50 pour 100 d’ici la fin de 2022, et de les réduire davantage d’ici le 31 mars 2026 pour les faire passer à 10 $ par jour.

« Des services de garde d’enfants sûrs, abordables et de qualité devraient être à la portée de toutes les familles en Nouvelle-Écosse, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Notre but est d’avoir des services de garde d’enfants dans toutes les localités à un prix abordable pour tous. »

La demande de déclarations d’intérêt contribuera à la mise en œuvre de l’importante entente que la Province a signée en juillet avec le gouvernement fédéral pour transformer le réseau d’apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants en Nouvelle-Écosse. L’Entente Canada-Nouvelle-Écosse pour l’apprentissage et la garde de jeunes enfants à l’échelle du Canada, d’une valeur de 605 millions de dollars, apportera les avantages suivants : 
-- réduction des frais de garde d’enfants de 50 pour 100 en moyenne d’ici le 31 décembre 2022;
-- garantie que les frais de garde d’enfants seront, en moyenne, de 10 $ par jour d’ici le 31 mars 2026;
-- création d’au moins 9 500 nouvelles places dans des centres d’apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants d’ici le 31 mars 2026, y compris de nouvelles places pour les nouveau-nés et les tout-petits; 
-- proposition dans les écoles de meilleures options de soins avant et après l’école, la priorité étant accordée aux enfants de cinq ans et moins.

La Nouvelle-Écosse instaurera de nouveaux modèles de financement, des frais réduits, un cadre de rémunération pour les éducateurs de la petite enfance et un programme de subventions renouvelé pour les familles.

 Selon les modalités de l’Entente Canada-Nouvelle-Écosse pour l’apprentissage et la garde de jeunes enfants à l’échelle du Canada, la Nouvelle-Écosse doit créer de nouvelles places dans des établissements de garde d’enfants sans but lucratif, financés par les fonds publics.

La Province s’engage à travailler avec tous les exploitants existants de garderies commerciales ou à but lucratif qui veulent profiter de l’occasion pour se joindre au système pancanadien par le biais d’un processus de déclaration d’intérêt. Tous les exploitants de garderies commerciales ou à but lucratif qui étaient titulaires d’un permis et financés par la Province au 13 juillet 2021 peuvent participer au nouveau système pancanadien et recevoir du financement pour être en mesure d’offrir, par exemple, des tarifs réduits aux parents, dans la mesure où les exploitants se plient aux modalités de l’entente. 

Le processus de déclaration d’intérêt sera une première étape pour aider le secteur des garderies commerciales ou à but lucratif à comprendre et à examiner ce que cela signifiera de faire partie du système pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants.

Faits en bref
-- La Nouvelle-Écosse investit chaque année 132,6 millions de dollars dans l’apprentissage et la garde de jeunes enfants, dont 54 millions pour la prématernelle et plus de 75 millions pour le secteur de la garde d’enfants.
-- Il y a 331 centres agréés de garde d’enfants en Nouvelle-Écosse et 14 agences agréées de services de garde d’enfants en milieu familial.

"Education and Early Childhood Development","Province Moves Ahead on Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child-Care System","EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT--Province Moves Ahead on Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child-Care System
---------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia is taking the next step toward affordable, accessible, high-quality and inclusive child care for all families.

Today, October 15, the Province released expressions of intent (EOI) to Nova Scotia’s not-for-profit child-care operators and those delivering the Nova Scotia Before and After Program. The Province is asking them to indicate their interest in expanding as it aims to create 9,500 new spaces for children under six, with a priority on communities where specific services are most needed.

This step comes as Nova Scotia moves to a 50 per cent reduction in child-care fees by the end of 2022 and a further reduction to $10 a day by March 31, 2026.

“Safe, affordable, quality child care should be available to every family in Nova Scotia,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Our goal is accessible child care in every community at a price that is affordable for all.”

The EOI will help implement the historic agreement Nova Scotia signed with the federal government in July to transform Nova Scotia’s early learning and child-care system. The $605 million Canada-Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement will accomplish the following: 
-- reduce child-care fees by an average of 50 per cent by December 31, 2022
-- ensure child-care fees are, on average, $10 per day by March 31, 2026
-- create at least 9,500 new early learning and child-care spaces by March 31, 2026, including new spaces for infants and toddlers, and 
-- enhance care options at schools for before and after school, prioritizing children aged five and under.

Nova Scotia will introduce new funding models, reduced fees, a compensation framework for early childhood educators and a renewed subsidy program for families. 

Under the terms of the Canada-Nova Scotia Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care Agreement, Nova Scotia must create new spaces in not-for-profit, publicly funded child care.

The Province is committed to working with all existing for-profit or commercial child-care operators who want an opportunity to join the Canada-wide system through an expression-of-interest process. All for-profit or commercial child-care programs that were licensed and provincially funded as of July 13, 2021, are able to take part in the new Canada-wide system, and receive funding to support items such as lower parent fees, as long as they follow the terms and conditions of the agreement.

This EOI process will serve as a first step for the for-profit or commercial child-care sector to understand and explore what it will mean to become part of the Canada-wide early learning and child-care system.

Quick Facts:
-- Nova Scotia invests $132.6 million in early learning and child care annually, including $54 million for pre-primary and over $75 million for the child-care sector
-- there are 331 licensed child-care centres in Nova Scotia and 14 licensed Family Home Child Care Agencies

"Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services","Illegal Vape Products Seized in New Waterford","SERVICE NOVA SCOTIA/INTERNAL SERVICES--Illegal Vape Products Seized in New Waterford 
-----------------------------------------------
More illegal vape products have been taken off the streets of Nova Scotia following an investigation by the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services’ compliance and special investigations unit.

On October 6 in New Waterford, a 36-year-old man was apprehended and found in possession of 733 bottles of flavoured e-juice totalling over 54,000 millilitres (54 litres) and valued at $34,500. He was arrested and the illegal products seized.

“Vaping can be harmful to your health, particularly for our youth,” said Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services Minister Colton LeBlanc. “The seizure we announced today is an example of how our compliance officers are working together with police to help protect our youth and keep illegal products off our streets.”

The estimated provincial tax value of the seizure is $27,000.

Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services, through its audit and enforcement section of the alcohol, gaming, fuel and tobacco division, worked with Cape Breton Regional Police on the investigation.

The man is scheduled to appear in court on November 24 to face charges under the Nova Scotia Revenue Act, Excise Act 2001, and Criminal Code.

Since January 1, 2021, Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services’ compliance and special investigations unit has conducted 25 seizures and seized 380,000 ml (380 litres) of illegal e-juice with a retail value of about $545,000. A large amount of this product was flavoured with high levels of nicotine which is attractive to youth.

Anyone with information about the sale and manufacturing of illegal vape or tobacco products is asked to contact their local police or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

Quick Facts:
-- on April 1, 2020, Nova Scotia became one of the first provinces to announce measures to address vaping and the only province to announce a full flavour ban
-- Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services, through its audit and enforcement section of the alcohol, gaming, fuel and tobacco division, is responsible for reducing illegal vape and tobacco products in Nova Scotia by working with its law enforcement partners, and through education and enforcement

The Government is modernizing the rules of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly to better reflect the diverse views of all Nova Scotians and create a more welcoming, inclusive environment, including changing references to “prayer” in the House rules.

“The rules that govern this historic chamber must evolve to ensure Province House is truly the People’s House,” said Premier Tim Houston. “No matter the colour of a person’s skin, their gender, who they love, the language they speak or how they pray, they should feel welcomed by their Government.”

Rule 16 of the Rules and Forms of Procedure of the House of Assembly will be amended by replacing the words “read prayers” with the words “allow a moment of quiet reflection.”

“As we welcome more newcomers and new residents to our province, it’s important that everyone sees themselves represented in the language we use within our democratic institutions,” said Premier Houston. “Our rules and the House itself will continue to evolve and change to ensure all Nova Scotians – current and future – feel included.”

"Justice","Amendments to Police Act Support Partnership Opportunities for SiRT","JUSTICE--Amendments to Police Act Support Partnership Opportunities for SiRT
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the Police Act introduced today, October 14, will provide more clarity around partnership agreements that enable Nova Scotia’s Serious Incident Response Team (SiRT) to act as the independent police oversight body in other regions.

“Nova Scotia’s Serious Incident Response Team is highly regarded across Canada for their expertise and professionalism in conducting investigations into serious incidents involving police,” said Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “We know other regions have expressed interest in collaborating with Nova Scotia for access to independent oversight and support.”

The amendments will enable the Province to enter into partnership agreements with other provinces or territories for SiRT to provide independent oversight of policing in the respective region on a continuing basis. 
The changes also make it clear that the director of SiRT will maintain the ability to make recommendations to the Minister of Justice to enter into agreements for SiRT to provide police oversight assistance or conduct investigations in other jurisdictions related to a specific incident or event.

Quotes:
“When there is a serious incident involving police, the public wants answers and expects a thorough, independent investigation. Providing the proper resources are in place, a collaboration between provinces in these instances makes sense and can ensure that, regardless of the location, an independent body is in place to look at what actions police took, decisions made and ultimately, whether the outcome could have been different.”
     - Felix Cacchione, director, Serious Incident Response Team

Quick Facts:
-- SiRT is an independent agency that has a mandate to investigate serious matters such as death, serious injury, sexual assault or other public-interest concerns involving the police
-- New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have reached an agreement in principle that would have SiRT act as the police oversight body for both provinces
-- both provinces committed to make the necessary legislative and policy changes, and the partnership is expected to start in 2022

"Justice / Premier's Office","Legislation to Protect Patients, Health-Service Providers, Staff of Healthcare Facilities","PREMIER’S OFFICE/JUSTICE--Legislation to Protect Patients, Health-Service Providers, Staff of Healthcare Facilities 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Province is taking action to protect patients, health-service providers and staff of healthcare facilities from protests intended to interfere with Nova Scotians accessing hospital and other healthcare services.

The Protecting Access to Health Services Act, introduced today, October 14, will prohibit protests and other disruptive activities at healthcare facilities and the homes of patients who receive healthcare services at home.

The legislation will establish a 50-metre safe-access bubble zone around facilities such as hospitals, mental-health services, home-care services, long-term care services, clinics, doctors’ offices and pharmacies. Peaceful protests can occur outside that perimeter. 

“Nova Scotians have the right to access healthcare without fear for their health and safety. This includes patients and their families,” said Premier Tim Houston. “While Nova Scotians have a right to protest, protests cannot be allowed to disrupt access to healthcare. People need to be able to go to work or access the help they need without facing intimidation or harassment.”  

The legislation will strike a balance between the rights to protest and free expression and the right of patients to access healthcare, and the need to keep health-service providers and the staff of healthcare facilities safe.

The legislation will come into force upon Royal Assent.

Quote:
“While we fully respect the right to protest, it is important that healthcare facilities and their properties are safe spaces for patients and families to access care. People struggling with serious health issues should be protected from the additional stress and worry protests may cause.”
     - Dr. Heather Johnson, President, Doctors Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- penalties will be similar to the Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Act, which prohibits protests at abortion services clinics
-- other provinces have also introduced or plan to introduce legislation to safeguard access to healthcare facilities and services 
-- the legislation is not limited to the current state of emergency, which came into effect March 22, 2020

----------------------------------------------------------------
Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui ont une déficience immunitaire moyenne à grave ou qui prennent des médicaments qui suppriment considérablement leur système immunitaire pourront prendre rendez-vous pour recevoir une troisième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19 à compter du 19 octobre.

Des renseignements supplémentaires sur les personnes admissibles se trouvent au https://novascotia.ca/vaccineplan/fr. Les personnes admissibles de 12 ans ou plus pourront prendre rendez-vous pour leur troisième dose en ligne ou par téléphone 28 jours après avoir reçu leur deuxième dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

Au moment de la prise de rendez-vous, les gens devront répondre aux critères d'une déficience immunitaire moyenne à grave. Les responsables des cliniques de vaccination passeront en revue les renseignements avec le patient pour s'assurer qu'il répond bien aux critères ou qu'il prend l'un des médicaments admissibles. Les personnes qui ne sont pas admissibles ne pourront pas recevoir une troisième dose à la clinique.

Le gouvernement provincial offrira également une troisième dose aux gens qui doivent voyager dans le cadre de leur travail pour répondre aux exigences d'entrée et d'isolement d'un pays qui ne reconnaît pas les doses combinées, par exemple AstraZeneca comme première dose et Pfizer comme deuxième dose. 

La décision par certains pays de ne pas reconnaître les doses combinées crée des difficultés financières pour les personnes qui doivent voyager dans le cadre de leur travail.

Pour être admissible à une troisième dose en vue d'un voyage d'affaires, vous devez :
-- être résident de la Nouvelle-Écosse; 
-- fournir une preuve officielle de vaccination pour chacune des deux doses reçues;

----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians who are moderately to severely immunocompromised or who are taking medications that substantially suppress their immune system will be able to book a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine starting October 19.

More information about who qualifies is available at https://novascotia.ca/vaccineplan . People 12 and older who qualify will be able to book a third dose online or by phone, 28 days after they have completed their primary COVID-19 vaccine series.

At the time of booking, people will need to meet the definition for moderately to severely immunocompromised. Vaccine clinics will also review the information with the patient to ensure they meet the definition or are on one of the eligible medications. Those who do not qualify will not be provided a third dose at the clinic.

The Province will also make third doses available to people who need to travel for work to meet entry requirements or avoid isolation in a country that does not recognize mixed doses. For example, first dose AstraZeneca and second dose Pfizer. 

The decision by some countries not to recognize mixed doses has created financial hardship for people whose job requires them to travel.

To become eligible for a third dose for work-related travel, people must:
-- be a Nova Scotia resident 
-- provide an official copy of proof of vaccination for each of the two doses received
-- provide written confirmation from their employer that they are required to travel to a country as part of their job and that country does not accept a mixed-vaccine series
-- provide official confirmation or documentation from the country or location of travel that a mixed-vaccine series does not permit entry or requires isolation upon entry.

Work-related third doses cannot be booked online or by phone. Applicants must send the required information by email to AdminINS@novascotia.ca where requests will be reviewed. Applicants will hear back within seven business days if they are approved, and receive details on scheduling an appointment.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoive un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia communities that want to pursue clean energy projects can now apply for funding through the Low Carbon Communities program.

“We have a strong commitment to sustainable prosperity, and our communities play a key part in developing climate-friendly solutions like clean energy projects,” said Tory Rushton, Minister of Natural Resources and Renewables. “We encourage communities to bring forward their innovative, sustainable and green projects to help us reduce emissions and advance our building efficiency, clean electricity and clean transportation sectors.”

The Low Carbon Communities program is open to community groups, municipalities, First Nations, post-secondary institutions, businesses and non-profit organizations with projects that benefit communities within Nova Scotia.

Funding can be used for community planning and designs, feasibility studies, education, public engagement and initiatives that demonstrate positive and innovative low carbon solutions.

Quotes:
“The Low Carbon Communities program was instrumental to the completion of the design of the Nova Scotia Native Women’s Association Resilience Centre. It ensured we could complete energy modelling for the sustainability of the centre, while making sure that the building reflected Mi’kmaq culture and need.”
     - Zabrina Whitman, project manager, Nova Scotia Native Women’s Association

“Clean Foundation is proud to work at the crossroads of clean energy and social equity – creating initiatives that address programming gaps for vulnerable, historically marginalized and underserved Nova Scotians. It is only through support from the Low Carbon Communities fund that we have been able to kick start a public housing retrofit project that demonstrates the potential to benefit thousands of Nova Scotian renters living in risk of energy poverty through fuel switching and energy efficiency upgrades.”
     - Rob Harris, senior manager, Clean Foundation

Quick Facts:
-- applications will be accepted until November 18
-- to date, the Low Carbon Communities program has invested over $2.1 million to support community-led projects across the province

"Justice / Premier's Office","Province Moves to Establish Fixed-Date General Elections","PREMIER’S OFFICE/JUSTICE--Province Moves to Establish Fixed-Date General Elections
--------------------------------------------------------
Voters will soon have certainty on the timing of future provincial elections.

Legislation introduced today, October 13, will, for the first time in Nova Scotia, establish fixed dates for provincial general elections.

Amendments to the Elections Act will set July 15, 2025, as the date of the next general election, with future elections to take place on the third Tuesday of July every four years. 

Nova Scotia will finally join the rest of the country in having a fixed-date election law.

“Nova Scotian voters need to have confidence in their electoral system,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Having a fixed date will mean predictability, transparency and it will limit any perceived advantage by the government to control the timing of the next election. The changes we are proposing will also allow Elections Nova Scotia to better plan for future elections, which can result in significant cost savings.”

The amendments also provide the chief electoral officer with authority to choose an alternative date if the legislated election date conflicts with a civic or religious holiday or overlaps with a federal or municipal election. The governor-in-council will be able to order that the election take place on the new date.

The changes to the act will not affect the lieutenant-governor’s constitutional authority to dissolve the legislature at any time on the advice of the premier or if there is a vote of non-confidence in the government in the legislature.

Quotes:
“I am pleased with the introduction of fixed-date election legislation, I support the choice of date and I appreciate the flexibility to choose an alternate date if necessary. This change will bring certainty to Elections Nova Scotia’s planning and budgetary cycles and improve the efficiency of our election readiness efforts.”
     - Richard Temporale, chief electoral officer, Elections Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- amending the Elections Act to establish fixed election dates is one of the actions in the Justice Minister’s mandate letter 
-- Elections Nova Scotia recommended fixed elections dates in its 2009 and 2013 reports on proposed changes to the Elections Act
-- every other province and territory in Canada and the federal government have fixed election date legislation in place; the majority have dates in October
-- those election laws all have clauses that preserve the constitutional authority of the lieutenant-governor to dissolve the legislature, or governor general to dissolve Parliament, and prompt an election when necessary 
-- having a predictable election date may create about $500,000 in operational savings for Elections Nova Scotia, and make it easier to attract election workers and secure accessible polling venues more efficiently

"Speech from the Throne","First Session of the 64th General Assembly of the Nova Scotia Legislature Speech from the Throne","SPEECH FROM THE THRONE--First Session of the 64th General Assembly of the Nova Scotia Legislature Speech from the Throne
-------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is the speech from the throne read today, October 12, by Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc at the opening of the first session of the 64th General Assembly of Nova Scotia.
-------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Speaker, Members of the Legislature, Nova Scotians. Welcome to the First Session of the 64th General Assembly of the Nova Scotia Legislature.

Today, we would like to begin by acknowledging that we are gathering in Mi’kma’ki, the traditional territory of the Mi’kmaw people.

The future of our wonderful province is very bright.

We have our challenges, but I remain incredibly optimistic about our opportunities.

For starters, I am so pleased that today’s gathering, for the first time in 19 months, looks normal. Nova Scotians should be proud of what we have accomplished from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I give thanks to Dr. Strang and the entire team at Public Health for their guidance, and also to Premier McNeil and Premier Rankin for having the courage to follow Public Health recommendations with the necessary public policy.

Nova Scotians did their part.

From staying home, respecting Public Health restrictions, missing our families and friends, to doing our parts and getting vaccinated to protect our most vulnerable. Our collective efforts shone a positive light on Nova Scotia.

We have truly been the envy of the world.

And when the world started to take notice of Nova Scotia, they increasingly liked what they saw. The world is learning what we already knew. Our response to the pandemic opened a window through which the world was exposed to our beautiful shores — our beaches, our blueberry fields, our hockey rinks, our golf courses, our hiking trails and, most importantly, they saw our people.

It is our people, both born and raised in Nova Scotia and newcomers choosing to make their home here, that make us one of the most desired places to be. And it is our people who upheld our most enviable attribute of all — our democracy, when they selected each and every member of this Chamber to take their respective seats.

Our system is fair and equitable. It gives a voice to the people, no matter how long you’ve lived here. No matter who you voted for. No matter the colour of your skin, your gender, who you love, the language you speak, or how you pray — you have a say.

Notre système est juste et équitable. Il donne une voix au peuple, peu importe depuis combien de temps vous êtes ici. Peu importe pour qui vous avez voté. Peu importe la couleur de votre peau, votre genre, qui vous aimez, la langue que vous parlez ou la façon dont vous priez, vous avez une voix.

It was Nova Scotia that led the way in establishing this system.

We led in democracy, we led in the pandemic, and we will continue to lead in so many other areas.
There is so much to be optimistic about for the future of our province. With record high vaccination rates, we are able to open and safely return to normal much sooner than anywhere else.

This means a renewed focus on our economy and population growth.

Nova Scotia is a province where people want to be. Now, it is the job of the government to make it possible for them to be here. We can do that while also ensuring those who are here have every opportunity to succeed.

From providing world class education to cutting red tape and enabling businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive, Nova Scotia can offer the foundation for success, resulting in growth of both our economy and our population.

All of this is possible.

But having the opportunity to succeed also means being healthy.

We have to be honest about the challenges in our health system. When we are honest about where we are today, and if we commit to working together, we can overcome the challenges and ensure that:
-- Nova Scotians have access to timely primary care,
-- Paramedics are supported and 911 response times are improved,
-- Wait times in our emergency departments and operating rooms are improved, and
-- Our seniors age with dignity.

Yes, the challenges are significant, but they can be addressed and doing so is the number one goal of our government.

We have to return to the place where every person in this province knows that when they get sick, they will be able to access the care they need.

To that end, we are starting from a great foundation. We have world class healthcare workers who are dedicated to providing the very best in care. Their government is listening to them. Doctors, nurses, paramedics, CCAs, and everyone delivering healthcare has an important voice that is respected and valued. They will help guide us forward.

Nous devons revenir à une situation où chaque personne dans cette province sait qu’elle pourra obtenir les soins nécessaires si elle est malade. Pour ce faire, nous misons sur une excellente fondation. Nous avons des travailleurs de la santé de première classe qui se consacrent à offrir les meilleurs soins possible. Leur gouvernement les écoute. Les médecins, les infirmières, les ambulanciers, les auxiliaires en soins continus et toute autre personne qui offre des soins de santé ont une voix importante qui est respectée et estimée. Ils nous guideront dans nos démarches.

In Memoriam

A strong future is dependent on remembering our past.

Sadly, COVID continues to take lives. Our hearts break for those families and friends who lost a loved one. It is our hope that everyone who can, does their part to get vaccinated and further protect their fellow Nova Scotians.

This year also saw the loss of a Nova Scotian and Canadian giant of business and philanthropy. Many people will remember Donald Sobey for his business vision and insight, his unwavering community support and love of the arts, but we will remember him for his kindness and his generosity with his time and wisdom.

With all his success, Donald never forgot where he came from and was always proud to call Pictou County home.

Just last week, Nova Scotia lost a son of Cumberland County, former Premier Roger Bacon. Premier Bacon was a tireless and dedicated public servant and a pioneering farmer who helped transform Nova Scotia’s blueberry industry.

Our province is better and stronger because of his many contributions.

Earlier this year, we mourned the loss of the Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Phillip served by Queen Elizabeth’s side for more than 70 years.

He led a remarkable life, dedicated to public service, working well into his 90s. He will long be remembered for his support of many charities and organizations, including his creation of the Duke of Edinburgh Award program that encourages youth around the world — including thousands of Nova Scotians — to develop themselves through personal discovery and growth, self-reliance, perseverance, and responsibility.

A Healthy Nova Scotia: Solutions for Healthcare

Much has been said about the state of our healthcare system in Nova Scotia over the last few years. We have all heard stories from friends and neighbours of the tragedies they have faced. Some of us have our own stories of navigating the system.

Now is the time to focus on this crisis.

We live in the best country in the world. And Nova Scotia can be a leader in this country, from our economy to our education system, but it all begins with providing access to healthcare.

There is no reason we can’t offer world class access to healthcare. And we will do it.

It starts with engaging those within the system. No one understands the issues preventing and delaying access than those working on the front lines every day. We have and will continue to listen to them speak up for our health system.

To date, not only have they identified areas of concern and improvement, but they are bringing forward common sense solutions.

Listening to and respecting our healthcare professionals is a first step in establishing more and quicker access to health services.

Our government isn’t focused on simply saying what they think people want to hear to improve healthcare. We are actually interested in improving the lives and health of Nova Scotians.

We will continue to do the work and the research, putting forward solutions for Nova Scotians. These solutions will include:
-- Incentivizing healthcare professionals to stay and to move here,
-- Listening to local communities and allowing them to have a say in recruitment,
-- Helping foreign-trained doctors get credentialed,
-- Implementing a retirement fund for full-time physicians,
-- Providing immediate access to care through telehealth to everyone on the waitlist for a doctor,
-- Changing the way we do patient transfers to free up more ambulances for emergencies, and
-- Increasing surgical hours to tackle the waitlist.

Solutions to the healthcare crisis are at the forefront of this government’s priorities. The newly created Office of Healthcare Professionals Recruitment has already seen some early successes and promising leads.

Two anesthetists and a psychiatrist have signed job offers to practice in Cape Breton, and two family doctors currently practising in Halifax have worked with the office to address concerns and will now stay in Nova Scotia. Several other physicians are also consulting with the Office to come to, or stay in, the province.

We need to recruit and retain more physicians, nurses, paramedics, continuing care assistants, and others. This new office brings the dedicated focus we need to find simple solutions to address common problems, and we are already making headway.

The new Office is focused on attracting and keeping doctors, nurses, continuing care assistants, paramedics, and other professionals. It will also work to eliminate existing barriers.

Efforts are underway to create a pilot project to make the Continuing Care Assistant profession more attractive by offering on-site child care at a nursing home in Sydney. Continuing care assistants report they have difficulty finding care that matches their shifts.

We will do everything possible to make sure that Nova Scotia is known as a welcoming place for healthcare professionals. This means improving working conditions, removing barriers, and streamlining the system to bring and keep healthcare professionals in Nova Scotia.

More and happier healthcare providers will mean more access to much needed services, which, in turn, will lead to a healthier Nova Scotia.

A Healthy Nova Scotia: Solutions for Mental Healthcare

A healthier Nova Scotia means more than access to physical care, it also means access to appropriate, timely mental health services.

Statistics suggest that at least one in five individuals experience issues related to their mental health — but we know that the numbers are climbing.

Thousands of Nova Scotians of all ages and backgrounds struggle with mental health conditions that are likely manageable — if they have access to appropriate support.

Access should not be exclusive to those who are fortunate enough to have insurance coverage or who can afford private care. Access should be truly universal.

The benefits of receiving treatment can be life changing. It can improve lives and it can improve our economy. It could transform our entire health system.

As a province, we must mobilize our collective resources now and remove the barriers of the two-tiered system. We will do whatever we can to end the days of individuals sitting silently in pain and struggling because they can’t afford the help.

Les avantages d’un traitement en matière de santé mentale peuvent changer une vie. Un tel traitement peut améliorer notre vie et notre économie. Il pourrait transformer notre système de santé dans son ensemble. En tant que province, nous devons mobiliser nos ressources collectives dès maintenant et éliminer les obstacles du système à deux paliers. Nous ferons notre possible pour que les gens n’aient plus jamais à lutter silencieusement contre leur douleur parce qu’ils n’ont pas les moyens d’obtenir de l’aide.

Help that would be available if their hand was broken, or their leg needed stitches.

Mental health care IS healthcare — and access to mental healthcare is a right, not a privilege. 
The government has a duty to provide mental health care that must be:
-- Free of Stigma,
-- Accountable,
-- Universally Accessible.

We are committing to build the most progressive mental health support system in Canada. One that embraces people and treats mental ailments with the same urgency as physical ones.

That system starts with a separate Minister for Mental Health and Addictions, making someone accountable. This dedicated minister will be responsible for making sure the system is truly accessible.

To ensure accessibility, our government would be the only one in Canada investing in universal mental health care.

Nova Scotia must lead on this important issue.

If you don’t qualify for private mental health coverage, under our plan you will.

We will work to reduce wait times for treatment and give Nova Scotians the care they need for better health outcomes.

We will work to attract new mental health professionals to Nova Scotia.

We will work to remove the stigma associated with mental health concerns and treatment.

Our Nova Scotia will be a leader in mental health care in Canada and the model that every province strives to achieve.

A Healthy Nova Scotia: Solutions for Seniors

Too often our seniors feel forgotten. That shouldn’t happen. Our seniors have contributed to our province, and to our communities, their whole lives. They’ve paid their taxes, raised families, looked after their neighbours, and donated and volunteered with charities and local organizations.

They have done this work to leave a positive mark on their community and to set up the next generation for success.

Nova Scotians need to know that their government will make the right decisions to care for our parents and grandparents as they age. This means a significant investment in long-term care that includes:
-- Building new, single bed long-term care rooms to begin to meet the demands of those on the waiting list and seniors who will need beds in the future,
-- Hiring more long-term care staff to support residents and to support current staff,
-- Increasing the minimum standards of care in long-term care properties.

We also know that long-term care homes are not for everyone and that many seniors want to spend as many years as they can in the homes that they bought and built themselves. Unfortunately, as many age and are unable to perform some household tasks, it can become increasingly difficult for them to maintain their homes.

We will provide additional support to help with household services for seniors who live independently and qualify. It’s a recognition that sometimes, as we get older, we might need extra support and that not every senior has a neighbour or kids or grandchildren who live close enough to do that.

Not only do we want to support people who are living independently, but we want to ensure that they can continue to do so. Seniors shouldn’t feel the need to push their limits.

We will respect our seniors and provide them with dignity and respect as they age. No one should live in fear of what’s next.

A Healthy Nova Scotia: Solutions for the Economy

We also have tremendous opportunities.

We have breathtaking scenic landscapes. We have dedicated educators empowering our next generation. We have an abundance of attractions bringing tourists from all over the world. We are becoming a mecca for filming television and movies. We have world class wine and agriculture products.

We have capable and talented people and organizations.

Our government will support them with made-in–Nova Scotia solutions that tell the world Nova Scotia is open for business and has the confidence to invest in its people and its future.

Notre gouvernement les appuiera par des solutions néo-écossaises qui annoncent au monde entier que la Nouvelle-Écosse est prête à faire des affaires et a la confiance nécessaire pour investir dans ses gens et dans son avenir.

Everyone wants higher pay, and every employer would love to pay their team more. Our government will position Nova Scotia to compete with other provinces and countries and invest in ourselves, by putting more money in employees’ pockets.

Our government will give employers a choice: leave the money they paid as corporate tax in the hands of the government or ask for it back on the condition that they distribute those same dollars to their team. That’s an easy decision, and it will mean more money in the hands of those who earned it: Nova Scotians.

This isn’t a plan for the rich, this is a plan for the middle class and those struggling to join it. If you want to stay competitive, you will pay a competitive salary. This means better paying jobs and growing businesses.

To support this growth, we need more trades workers building homes and apartments, roads, and other infrastructure around the province. We know parents don’t want to lose their children to Alberta. We want to keep them here and give them every advantage to stay.

Our government will eliminate personal income tax on the first $50,000 of income for trades workers under the age of 30. Once they’re here, they won’t want to leave.

We have to train them. That means increasing capacity in our trades education in our high schools, and making students aware, at a younger age, of the possibilities that exist. We will place an increased emphasis on young girls and students with diverse backgrounds, educating them on the opportunities available to them.

There is a housing crisis in Nova Scotia. We have a plan to address this crisis — and attracting and training more trades people is critical to its success.

By focusing on Nova Scotia — our people, our talent, our beauty, and our goods — so much is possible.

This made-in–Nova Scotia approach will grow our province. It will retain our youth and will attract more. This is essential, because in order to make the necessary investments in healthcare, we need a healthy economy.

Healthcare and the economy go hand in hand, and we will work to ensure that as healthcare sees the investment it needs, the economy is receiving equal attention focusing on growth.

A Healthy Nova Scotia: Solutions for the Environment

In 2006, the Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act laid the framework for Nova Scotia to make transformative environmental change and position Nova Scotia as an environmental leader.
These 2006 goals forced the Province to take decisive action on the environment which laid the groundwork to position Nova Scotia as a world leader.

In 2021, environmental leadership is a non-negotiable prerequisite for any government.

There is no debate over whether climate change needs to be addressed. The debate is only about how it should be addressed.

Les objectifs de 2006 ont obligé la Province à prendre des mesures décisives en ce qui a trait à l’environnement, ce qui a jeté les bases pour permettre à la Nouvelle-Écosse de devenir un chef de file sur la scène mondiale. En 2021, le leadership environnemental est un prérequis non négociable pour tout gouvernement. Il n’y a aucun débat à avoir : il faut absolument aborder le changement climatique. Le débat doit se concentrer sur la façon dont le problème doit être abordé.

Nova Scotians demand that their government walk the walk on environmental action and re-establish goals in the best interest of future generations. Striving for modern day solutions starts with bold legislation that builds on our history of leadership in adopting green measures and putting forward solutions for climate-friendly, sustainable development.

We will set aggressive targets that 80% of energy will be supplied by renewable energy by 2030.
We are focused on the future and decisions that keep our province, country, and world sustainable for future generations.

We will take the lead from former Prime Minister the Right Honourable Brian Mulroney who said:
“Now is the time to act. Now is not the time to imprison ourselves in ideological arguments. Now is the time to test the outer limits of what we can achieve for future generations.”

A Healthy Nova Scotia: Solutions for Accountability

A healthy government is one where Nova Scotians have the information and opportunity to hold their government to account. We welcome this and will provide members of the public and the Members of the Legislative Assembly with the tools to do so.

A government should be willing to defend, in public forums, the decisions it makes. This is a key commitment of our government.

There are only so many mechanisms that the opposition really has to hold the government to account. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts is one of them. We will return this committee to its original format and allow departments to be called as witnesses before a committee that meets regularly.
Nova Scotians are also faced with constant uncertainty around the timing of elections because they live in the lone province that does not have fixed election dates.

That practice ends with this government.

Election dates will be set immediately so that every Nova Scotian knows the timeline upon which they will be able to exercise their ultimate right of holding this government and every subsequent government to account.

This session will see the creation of fixed election dates in Nova Scotia.

La date des élections sera établie immédiatement pour que tous les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse connaissent l’horaire selon lequel ils pourront exercer leur droit absolu de demander des comptes à ce gouvernement et à tout gouvernement subséquent. L’établissement d’une date fixe pour les élections en Nouvelle-Écosse aura lieu au courant de la présente session.

Finally, much has been written about our freedom of information laws and the lack of effectiveness of our current laws. While stronger privacy laws may be uncomfortable for the government, discomfort is warranted if it means holding the government to a higher standard. For us, this means providing those protections to Nova Scotians and walking the walk.

Closing

It is time for Nova Scotia to move forward with solutions that work for Nova Scotians. It’s time to embrace what is possible for healthcare, for our economy, and for our future.

We know Nova Scotians share the hope that we have for our beautiful province and its potential.
Nova Scotians are right to expect that we all live up to the highest standard.

We resolve to give everything we have to make life better for you.

But — if we work together — we can get the job done much quicker.

We can put Nova Scotians on the path to financial sustainability AND fix healthcare.

We can support our traditional industries AND build an environment plan that fights climate change.

We can make our province a magnet for doctors, investors, and tourists alike, and remain proud of our traditions and our heritage.

No matter how long you’ve lived here. No matter the colour of your skin, your gender, who you love, the language you speak, or how you pray, our government will listen to you, will respect you, and will do everything in our power to make access to healthcare better and your life more affordable.

We have worked so hard. But the work is just getting started. There will be some tough decisions ahead.

But today, we can have optimism. We can have hope. Hope that healthcare will get better. And hope that tomorrow will be better than today.

------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotia will move forward with solutions that work for Nova Scotians, addressing the problems within the healthcare system and embracing what is possible for the province’s economy and future.

That was the main message of the speech from the throne, delivered by Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc today, October 12, as he opened the first session of the 64th general assembly of the Nova Scotia legislature. 

Addressing the healthcare crisis is the government’s number one priority, with a focus on listening to healthcare providers and bringing forward solutions that will:
-- attract and retain more healthcare professionals
-- improve access to primary healthcare and mental healthcare
-- support seniors in their homes and in long-term care
-- tackle wait times. 

“When we are honest about where we are today, and if we commit to working together, we can overcome the challenges,” said Lt.-Gov. LeBlanc in the speech. “Nova Scotia can offer the foundation for success, resulting in growth of both our economy and our population. But having the opportunity to succeed also means being healthy.”

The government further commits to giving attention to the economy at the same time as it is investing in healthcare. The plan will help position Nova Scotia to compete with other provinces and countries, through the strength of its people, talent, beauty and goods. 

The government’s made-in-Nova Scotia solutions to help grow the economy include:
-- putting more money in employees’ pockets by giving employers a choice of paying corporate taxes or increasing the pay of their workforce
-- training and attracting more trades workers, with increased emphasis on girls and students with diverse backgrounds
-- addressing the housing crisis
-- introducing environmental legislation to adopt green measures, aggressive targets and other solutions for climate-friendly, sustainable development.

A healthy government is one where Nova Scotians have the information and opportunity to hold their government to account. That is why the government’s path forward commits to greater accountability with the creation of fixed election dates and returning the legislature’s public accounts committee to its original format, which allows officials from any department to be called as witnesses before a committee that meets regularly.

“There is so much to be optimistic about for the future. We can fix healthcare and put Nova Scotians on the path to financial sustainability; we can support our traditional industries and build an environment plan that fights climate change; and we can make our province a magnet for doctors, investors and tourists alike, and remain proud of our traditions and our heritage,” said Premier Tim Houston. “Our government is committed to doing everything in our power to make access to healthcare better and life better for all Nova Scotians.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 12, Nova Scotia is reporting 99 new cases of COVID-19 and 130 recoveries since the last update on October 8.

Twenty-seven new cases were reported on October 9; 16 new cases on October 10; 22 new cases on October 11; and 34 new cases are being reported today, October 12.

There are 86 cases in Central Zone, six cases in Western Zone, four cases in Northern Zone and three cases in Eastern Zone.

There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

Over the past four days, eight schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 197 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 15 people are in hospital, including two in ICU.

Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 4,138 tests on October 8; 3,275 tests on October 9; 2,497 tests on October 10; and 2,334 tests on October 11.

As of October 11, 1,532,336 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 739,458 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 12 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce 99 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 130 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 8 octobre.

On a dénombré 27 nouveaux cas le 9 octobre, 16 nouveaux cas le 10 octobre, 22 nouveaux cas le 11 octobre et 34 nouveaux cas aujourd’hui, le 12 octobre.

Il y a 86 cas dans le secteur du centre, 6 dans le secteur de l’ouest, 4 dans le secteur du nord et 3 dans le secteur de l’est.

Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Au cours des quatre derniers jours, on a avisé les responsables de huit écoles d’une ou plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 197 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 15 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 2 aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 138 tests le 8 octobre, 3 275 tests le 9 octobre, 2 497 tests le 10 octobre et 2 334 tests le 11 octobre.

Au 11 octobre, 1 532 336 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 739 458 étaient une deuxième dose.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 115 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 4 décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 914. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests 

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 17 octobre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Recognizing that good mental health is an essential part of overall health, the Province is expanding access to e-health resource Togetherall to all of Nova Scotia’s post-secondary students and apprentices. 

Togetherall was previously available only to young people aged 16 to 29. It is a safe and anonymous online peer-to-peer community that is moderated by registered clinical practitioners, and it is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Togetherall members can share their thoughts and experiences by writing community posts, supporting others’ stories, creating art or taking well-being courses and resources.

“For World Mental Health Day on October 10, and every day, we recognize the critical importance of supporting self-care for post-secondary students anytime, anywhere,” said Brian Wong, Minister of Advanced Education. “Our students may be living away from their family and friend support network and may be struggling with anxiety. This is another way we are supporting the health of our students and making the availability of mental health resources a high priority.”

Expanding access to Togetherall adds to a suite of free online mental health resources available to post-secondary students through HealthyMindsNS.

The province is providing $10,000 for the additional access to Togetherall, in partnership with RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) Future Launch, Nova Scotia Health and the QEII Foundation.

Quotes:
“Young adults are often more vulnerable to experiencing mental illness. It is our moral responsibility to provide them with the support they need when and where they need them. Togetherall is a great example of how this can be achieved. The online community of peer-to-peer support allows people to reach out anonymously and without fear of judgement and in a format that is familiar to them.”
     - Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health

""Being able to connect with peers who can relate to your experiences and circumstances is hugely beneficial for students and youth, particularly those who may not want to access in-person support or who would prefer to do so anonymously.""
     - Ben Fairhurst, chair, Students Nova Scotia

“The pandemic has only exacerbated the need for empowering and inclusive mental health support. We see a growing diversity in Nova Scotia members’ age, work status, gender and ethnicity, which allows for a variety of perspectives within the community.”
     - Matthew McEvoy, senior vice-president and general manager, Togetherall North America

“Our commitment to youth mental well-being is focused on prevention and early intervention programs that help provide young people timely access to knowledge, supports and care, when and where they need it. Through our continued partnership with Togetherall, Nova Scotia Health and now HealthyMindsNS, RBC Future Launch will help address the barriers often faced by young people when trying to access the supports they need.”
     - Mark Beckles, vice-president, Social Impact and Innovation, RBC
 

Quick Facts:
-- World Mental Health Day is Sunday, October 10
-- Mental Health Awareness Week is October 3-9
-- since Togetherall became available in Nova Scotia this spring, more than 900 youth have taken advantage of the peer-to-peer service
-- HealthyMindsNS is a suite of online mental health resources that are available free to post-secondary students in Nova Scotia to complement existing resources available on campuses

----------------------------------------------------------------
Le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse, recommande la fermeture de l'école élémentaire Duc d'Anville à Halifax afin de contenir la propagation de la COVID-19.

L'école sera fermée aux élèves du 12 au 15 octobre pour prévenir la transmission du virus dans la communauté scolaire. L'apprentissage à domicile débutera le 12 octobre.

« Bien que notre objectif soit de maintenir l'apprentissage en classe, j'ai clairement indiqué que si des mesures plus rigoureuses étaient nécessaires, comme la fermeture d'une école, je n'hésiterais pas à agir, affirme le Dr Strang. L'équipe du médecin-hygiéniste régional surveille la situation de très près et recommande une fermeture temporaire pour contenir la propagation. »

L'unité mobile de dépistage de la santé publique continuera d'être présente dans la communauté la semaine prochaine. Un test négatif sera exigé pour retourner en classe le 18 octobre. L'équipe locale de la Santé publique continuera d'offrir des cliniques de vaccination contre la COVID-19 dans la communauté afin d'encourager les familles à se faire vacciner.

« Je comprends que l'incertitude de la pandémie cause du stress pour les familles. Le docteur Strang et son équipe nous ont aidés à naviguer la pandémie et continuent de prendre des décisions qui visent à protéger tout le monde, souligne Becky Druhan, ministre de l'Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance. Nous suivrons toujours les conseils de la Santé publique pour assurer la sécurité de nos élèves, de notre personnel et des communautés dans leur ensemble. »

Les familles des élèves qui fréquentent cette école recevront des renseignements supplémentaires de la Santé publique.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, is recommending closure of Duc d’Anville Elementary in Halifax to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The school will be closed to students from October 12 to October 15 to prevent further spread of the virus among the school community. At-home learning will begin October 12.

“While our goal is to keep students learning in the classroom, I was clear that if stronger measures were needed, like closing a school, we would not hesitate to act,” said Dr. Strang. “The regional medical officer of health team has been closely monitoring this situation, and they are recommending a temporary closure to contain the spread.”

Public health’s mobile testing unit will continue to be in the community next week. A negative test will be required to return to school on October 18. The local public health team will continue to offer COVID-19 vaccination outreach clinics in the community to encourage and support families to get vaccinated.

“I understand the uncertainty of the pandemic is stressful on families. Dr. Strang and his team have led us through the pandemic and continue to make decisions that keep everyone safe,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “We will always follow the advice of public health to ensure our students, staff and broader communities remain safe.”

Families of students at the school will receive more information from public health.

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine ou les jours fériés. La mise à jour du mardi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 8 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce 25 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 38 rétablissements.

Il y a 17 cas dans le secteur du centre, 4 dans le secteur de l’est, 3 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l’ouest.

Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Le 7 octobre, on a avisé les responsables de deux écoles d’une ou plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Il est important de noter qu’une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu’il y a une propagation au sein de l’établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus à l’école. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Il y a eu 5 214 cas du 15 mars au 6 octobre 2021. De ce nombre :

-- 257 personnes (4,9 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 332 personnes (6,4 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 4 625 personnes (88,7 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 290 personnes ont été hospitalisées. De ce nombre :

-- 7 personnes (2,4 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 29 personnes (10,0 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 254 personnes (87,6 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 32 personnes sont décédées. De ce nombre :

-- 3 personnes (9,4 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (9,4 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 26 personnes (81,3 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 234 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 15 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 4 aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 22 139 tests de dépistage rapide ont été effectués du 1er au 7 octobre. Cela comprend 5 709 tests de dépistage rapide, 8 730 tests rapides à faire à la maison distribués dans les cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide d’Halifax, de Fairview et de Dartmouth et 16 430 tests rapides administrés dans le cadre du programme de dépistage de la COVID-19 en milieu de travail.

Le 7 octobre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 740 tests.

Au 7 octobre, 1 529 212 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 737 561 étaient une deuxième dose.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 1 022 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 4 décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 784. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests 

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 17 octobre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Nova Scotia is not issuing COVID-19 news releases or updating the COVID-19 data dashboard on weekends or holidays. Tuesday updates will include weekend data.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 8, Nova Scotia is reporting 25 new cases of COVID-19 and 38 recoveries.

There are 17 cases in Central Zone, four cases in Eastern Zone, three cases in Northern Zone and one case in Western Zone.

There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

On October 7, two schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures .

There have been 5,214 cases from March 15 to October 6, 2021. Of those:

-- 257 (4.9 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 332 (6.4 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 4,625 (88.7 per cent) were unvaccinated

There were 290 people hospitalized. Of those:

-- 7 (2.4 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 29 (10.0 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 254 (87.6 per cent) were unvaccinated

Thirty-two people died. Of those:

-- 3 (9.4 per cent) were fully vaccinated
-- 3 (9.4 per cent) were partially vaccinated
-- 26 (81.3 per cent) were unvaccinated

As of today, Nova Scotia has 234 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 15 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

There were 22,139 rapid tests administered between October 1 and 7. This includes 5,709 rapid tests at the pop-up sites in Halifax and Dartmouth and 16,430 through the workplace screening program. Another 8,730 home rapid tests were distributed at the pop-up sites.

On October 7, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,740 tests.

As of October 7, 1,529,212 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 737,561 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

Since August 1, there have been 1,022 positive COVID-19 cases and four deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 784 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.
Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 17, 2021

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is an op-ed from Brian Comer, Minister responsible for the Office of Addictions and Mental Health
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mental illness and addictions affect thousands of Nova Scotians. The impacts and suffering are felt by thousands more – partners, children, parents, friends, caregivers and the communities we live and work in.

As a province and as a society, we need to do more – more to embrace those who suffer and more to address the many concerns surrounding mental illness and addictions. We can do this by addressing the stigma against mental illness and addictions, by looking at social needs like housing and income and how they contribute to mental health and addictions, by eliminating barriers to accessing our health-care system and by expanding access to the right services and supports needed for recovery.

The theme for this year’s World Mental Health Day is Mental Health in an Unequal World. It speaks to inequitable access to mental health care, and that is something we have committed to address. Our government will ensure that all Nova Scotians, regardless of where they live or their income, will have access to mental health services. We also need to address, head-on, the added barriers and increased mental health challenges among marginalized populations including African Nova Scotians, Indigenous people, members of the 2SLGBTIQ+ community, and the need to provide culturally appropriate and gender specific supports.

We know the enormity of the tasks ahead of us to achieve these goals.

There is no single solution. The work ahead will take time and a willingness to take bold action and challenge the systems in place. It will mean taking an honest look at the social structures in place to support us and acknowledging their failures.
 
We cannot take a narrow view of mental health, in isolation from physical health issues or from the social determinants of health. We need to work alongside those in our education system, justice system and housing and community services network on solutions that make a positive impact on the health and well-being of Nova Scotians.

I worked on the frontline of mental health and addictions treatment and know some of the challenges that need to be addressed. There is much we can learn from our community-based grassroots organizations and from front-line mental health workers.

We have incredibly dedicated front-line mental health professionals and community workers in Nova Scotia who have devoted their lives to making life better for others. They need to be part of the bigger discussion. And I intend to seek their ideas and solutions.

World Mental Health Day and Mental Illness Awareness Week remind us of the importance of this issue and challenge us to work even harder to improve mental health services.

I think it is fair to say that these past 19-plus pandemic months have been extremely difficult for everyone. We have seen the impacts that fear, job loss and lack of social interactions have had on Nova Scotians. But we have also seen resilience, compassion and strength and that should be celebrated.

Mental illness and addictions affect us all. The well-being of our province relies on the well-being of our people. 
It is time to lead the charge and be the light for those who often find themselves in darkness.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Trente nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 36 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Trente nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 36 cas résolus 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 7 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce 30 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 36 rétablissements.
 
Il y a 26 cas dans le secteur du centre, 2 dans le secteur de l’ouest et 2 dans le secteur de l’est.
 
Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Le 6 octobre, on a avisé les responsables de deux écoles d’une ou plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Il est important de noter qu’une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu’il y a une propagation au sein de l’établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus à l’école. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 247 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 16 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 5 aux soins intensifs.

Le 6 octobre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 201 tests.
 
Au 6 octobre, 1 526 737 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 736 190 étaient une deuxième dose. 
 
Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 997 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 4 décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 746. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests 

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.
  
Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 17 octobre 2021.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","30 New Cases of COVID-19, 36 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--30 New Cases of COVID-19, 36 Recoveries 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 7, Nova Scotia is reporting 30 new cases of COVID-19 and 36 recoveries.
 
There are 26 cases in Central Zone, two cases in Western Zone and two cases Eastern Zone.
 
There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

On October 6, two schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 247 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 16 people are in hospital, including five in ICU.

On October 6, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 4,201 tests.
 
As of October 6, 1,526,737 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 736,190 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.
 
Since August 1, there have been 997 positive COVID-19 cases and four deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 746 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:
 
Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.
 
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.
 
Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.
 
Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

"Health and Wellness","Patient Transfer Services Expanded to Improve Access to Care","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Patient Transfer Services Expanded to Improve Access to Care
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians will have better access to emergency care with expanded patient transfer services that will relieve pressure on the emergency health system and paramedics.

New staff and more vehicles will be added to the patient transfer unit fleet, doubling the service provided each week. Also, a new vehicle will be added to the medical transport service in Sydney this week, and the service will expand to offer provincewide coverage by the end of the year.

“These changes will free up ambulances and paramedics to focus more on providing the emergency care Nova Scotians need,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “These are the kinds of solutions we heard from many front-line health-care staff and will help ensure we are using our resources more efficiently so Nova Scotians can get the care they need more quickly.”

Government will invest $3.1 million annually to expand the patient transfer service, which includes:
-- adding 28 new non-paramedic drivers, which will free up paramedics now required to drive the vehicles
-- adding five new vehicles to the existing fleet
-- doubling the number of patient transfer hours per week, which will help fully staffed ground ambulances focus on 911 responses

Patient transfer units provide non-emergency transportation between health-care facilities for patients who may require some level of monitoring or care during transport. The changes mean the units will be staffed with one Emergency Health Services (EHS) employee who is a driver and one EHS paramedic who provides care. If multiple patients are transported, two EHS paramedics and a driver will staff the unit.

Government will also invest $1.9 million annually to operate an additional eight vans with the medical transport service fleet to offer provincewide coverage. It is expected vans will be in service in Cape Breton, New Glasgow, Truro, Yarmouth, Amherst and Antigonish by the end of December. 

Medical transport service vehicles provide non-clinical transportation between health-care facilities for several people at once, including those requiring wheelchair services. They are staffed with one EHS employee who operates the vehicle and is in contact with the EHS medical communication centre.

Quotes:
“With the right training and rollout, transport operators can potentially help the system as a whole and allow our emergency ambulances to focus on 911 calls.”
     - Alan Edmonds, advanced care paramedic, EHS patient transfer unit

“Additional EHS resources in Cape Breton Regional Municipality is welcome news, as the expansion of non-emergency transports will not only help EHS teams respond to emergencies but also support our efforts in transferring multiple patients between sites for appointments and treatments, as well as patients who have been discharged.”
     - Brett MacDougall, executive director, Health Services, Eastern Zone, Nova Scotia Health

Quick Facts:
-- there are 160 ambulances and approximately 1,200 paramedics in Nova Scotia
-- EHS paramedics respond to about 175,000 calls every year for emergencies and patient transfers
-- there are now 14 patient transfer units, including multi-patient transfer units and wheelchair patient transfer units
-- there are now three medical transport service vehicles in use in Bridgewater, Kentville and Central Zone as part of a one-year pilot launched in March
-- funding to expand the medical transport service expansion comes from the Canada-Nova Scotia Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement, which was announced in 2016 and provides federal support of approximately $286 million over 10 years to Nova Scotia for initiatives related to youth, mental health, and home and community care

All 11,000 direct employees of the provincial government will be required to be fully vaccinated by November 30.

“As one of the larger employers in the province, I believe government must lead by example to protect our employees and the public we serve from the risk of COVID-19 and its variants and to support the provincial effort to increase vaccination rates,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of the Public Service Commission.

This announcement follows the expansion of the provincial vaccine mandate on October 4 to include some employees in the departments of Community Services, Seniors and Long-Term Care, Justice and Education and Early Childhood Development.

Provincial government employees who are not fully vaccinated by November 30 will face employment consequences including unpaid administrative leave unless they have received an employer-approved exemption.

Full vaccination will also be a condition for new staff being hired.

Details of the policy and implementation plan are currently being finalized.

“Accessibility is a human right, one that will benefit all Nova Scotians and make the province a better place. By working together and consulting with persons with disabilities, the business community and municipalities, we will strike the right balance,” said Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “We are confident that by building on the great work that has been done by the Accessibility Advisory Board, the Accessibility Directorate and stakeholders, our province will be accessible by 2030.”

Dr. Aubrecht is an assistant professor in the sociology department at St. Francis Xavier University and director of its intersectional disability studies lab.

Since the Accessibility Act came into force, the government has been working with persons with disabilities and the public and private sectors to begin developing accessibility standards. Standards are currently being developed in the areas of the built environment, education and employment. The other standard areas to be developed are goods and services, information and communication, and transportation.

Quotes:
“I am pleased and honoured to conduct the first review of the Accessibility Act. This is an important piece of legislation that, upon full implementation, will acknowledge and advance the human rights of persons with disabilities, with significant positive impact on people and communities.”
     - Dr. Katie Aubrecht, Canada Research Chair, health equity and social justice, St. Francis Xavier University

Quick Facts:
-- the Accessibility Act, passed in April 2017, requires an external review of the act within four years of its coming into force and every five years thereafter
-- the act requires the reviewer to consult with persons with disabilities and other stakeholders affected by the legislation
-- it also requires that the justice minister make the reviewer’s report public and table it in the House of Assembly within 30 days of receiving it
-- the review is expected to begin this fall and take approximately eight to 10 months to complete

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Un décès, 25 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 18 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Un décès, 25 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 18 cas résolus 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 6 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Une septuagénaire est décédée dans le secteur du centre.

La Nouvelle-Écosse annonce également 25 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 18 rétablissements.

Il y a 20 cas dans le secteur du centre, 2 dans le secteur de l’ouest, 2 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l’est.

Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Le 5 octobre, on a avisé les responsables de quatre écoles d’une ou plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Il est important de noter qu’une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu’il y a une propagation au sein de l’établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus à l’école. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 254 cas actifs de COVID-19. De ce nombre, 15 personnes sont hospitalisées, dont 5 aux soins intensifs.

Le 5 octobre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 645 tests.

Au 5 octobre, 1 523 340 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 734 248 étaient une deuxième dose.

Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 968 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et 4 décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 710. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d’évaluation primaire de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.

On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.

Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle :

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs);
-- un mal de tête;
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale;
-- un mal de gorge;
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire.

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Fait en bref
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 17 octobre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 6, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A woman in her 70s in Central Zone has died.

Nova Scotia is also reporting 25 new cases of COVID-19 and 18 recoveries.

There are 20 cases in Central Zone, two cases in Western Zone, two cases in Northern Zone, and one case in Eastern Zone.

There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

On October 5, four schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 254 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 15 people are in hospital, including five in ICU.

On October 5, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 4,645 tests.

As of October 5, 1,523,340 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 734,248 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.

Testing advice:

Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.

Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.

Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 6, the Province advised Alderney CFF Limited that it will purchase the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility and East Coast Forensic Hospital in Dartmouth when the lease expires in 2026.

“These facilities are centrally located and provide important programming and supports for some of our most vulnerable citizens,” said Brad Johns, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “The decision to purchase will result in substantial savings compared to renewing the lease or investing in new construction.”

The purchase price will be about $18 million. The lease agreement with Alderney CFF required that a decision to purchase, surrender the building or extend the lease be made this year.

Quotes: 
“The purchase of the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility and East Coast Forensic Hospital is a positive step for the province. There will be continued operation and supports for patients in this central location.” 
     - Michelle Thompson, Minister of Health and Wellness

-- the facilities were constructed as a P3 project, replacing four aging facilities in Colchester, Lunenburg, Kings and Halifax counties
-- the facilities opened in October 2001 and were the first co-located correctional facility and hospital in Canada
-- in 2019, the Province invested $6.8 million to upgrade and modernize the correctional facility to support direct supervision
-- staff provide educational, vocational and spiritual programming and clinical services; in the past 24 months, five inmates have graduated from Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) through Limitless, a Justice-NSCC partnership program that offers individuals in custody the opportunity for meaningful change, successful reintegration into communities and sustainable employment

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Province Supports More Age-Friendly and Inclusive Communities","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Province Supports More Age-Friendly and Inclusive Communities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The Province is supporting communities to become more age-friendly and inclusive through project funding from the Age-Friendly Communities Grant program.

Seniors and Long-Term Care Minister Barbara Adams opened the call for applications to the program today, October 5, during a Seniors’ Week celebration at the Halifax Oval in partnership with Hike Nova Scotia and the Healthy Tomorrow Foundation.

“Seniors are leaders, volunteers, caregivers, mentors and so much more, and Seniors’ Week is a chance to celebrate older Nova Scotians and the contribution they make to our communities,” Minister Adams said. “The Age-Friendly Communities Grant program supports projects that help older Nova Scotians stay active, healthy and engaged in their communities.”

Through the program, organizations like the Mi’kmaq Circle of Hope Society can now offer programs like Kekina'muemk: Mi'kmaq Grandmothers Build Leadership for Women and Girls, where Mi'kmaq grandmothers mentor young Mi'kmaq women and girls on traditional roles of Mi’kmaq women in community and family life.

These grants also support programs like NS Walks, a new initiative from Hike Nova Scotia that connects less active Nova Scotians to walking groups and accessible walking routes in their community.

Grant applications are open until December 10, 2021, and will be reviewed and approved by the end of January 2022. Businesses and individuals are not eligible.

Quotes:
""Walking and talking connects us with others and is good for the body and mind. This walk program is the ‘book club’ of physical activity and is an excellent way to engage older Nova Scotians and get them moving.""
     - Colin McCrae, walk leader, NS Walks

""If you want to age well, one of the best things you can do is to move more throughout the day – even just a little bit. The best part is, you don’t need to join a gym or take up a sport, simply add more movement into your daily routine.""
     - Dr. Alex Mitchell, board chair, Healthy Tomorrow Foundation

Quick Facts:
-- a total of $340,000 is available for Age-Friendly Communities Grant projects for the 2021-22 fiscal year
-- provincewide projects can receive up to $25,000 and smaller-scale community projects can receive up to $10,000

Ils ont jusqu'au 30 novembre pour être entièrement vaccinés.

Les employés qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés au 30 novembre seront mis en congé administratif non rémunéré. Le gouvernement provincial ne fournira pas aux employeurs des fonds supplémentaires pour couvrir les congés administratifs liés au statut vaccinal.

Employees who are not fully vaccinated by November 30 will be placed on unpaid administrative leave. Government will not provide employers with any additional funding to cover administrative leaves of absence related to vaccine status.

As announced on September 29, the vaccine mandate also applies to:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","86 New Cases of COVID-19, 94 Recoveries","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--86 New Cases of COVID-19, 94 Recoveries 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, October 4, Nova Scotia is reporting 86 new cases of COVID-19 and 94 recoveries since the last update on October 1.
 
There are 67 cases in Central Zone, 13 cases in Western Zone, five cases in Northern Zone and one case in Eastern Zone. 
 
There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

Over the past three days, seven schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 231 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 16 people are in hospital, including four in ICU.

Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 3,386 tests on October 1; 2,888 tests on October 2; and 3,636 tests on October 3.
 
As of October 3, 1,515,806 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 730,126 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.
 
Since August 1, there have been 904 positive COVID-19 cases and three deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 670 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:
 
Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet the criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.
 
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.
 
Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.
 
Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 17, 2021

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","86 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 94 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--86 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 94 cas résolus 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 4 octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 86 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 94 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 1er octobre.
 
Il y a 67 cas dans le secteur du centre, 13 dans le secteur de l'ouest, 5 dans le secteur du nord et 1 dans le secteur de l'est. 
 
Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

Au cours des trois derniers jours, on a avisé sept écoles d'une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Il est important de noter qu'une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu'il y a une propagation au sein de l'établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus dans l'école. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 231 cas actifs de COVID-19. Seize personnes sont hospitalisées dans des unités de traitement de la COVID-19, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 3 386 tests le 1er octobre, 2 888 tests le 2 octobre et 3 636 tests le 3 octobre.
 
Au 3 octobre, 1 515 806 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 730 126 étaient une deuxième dose.
 
Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 904 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et trois décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 670. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests
 
Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.
 
On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.
 
Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.
 
Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 17 octobre 2021.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Vaccine Received Outside Province Now Accepted for Nova Scotia Proof of Vaccination","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Vaccine Received Outside Province Now Accepted for Nova Scotia Proof of Vaccination
----------------------------------------------------------------
Nova Scotians can now add COVID-19 vaccines that they received outside the province or through a workplace vaccination program to their Nova Scotia proof of vaccination.

The opportunity is available to:
-- permanent residents of Nova Scotia who received one or both doses in another province, territory or country
-- permanent residents who received one or both doses in a workplace vaccination program, such as members of the Canadian Armed Forces
-- anyone who received at least one dose of vaccine in Nova Scotia

Having a Nova Scotia proof of vaccination is not required for everyone. Original records from the place where people were vaccinated are acceptable. However, the standard Nova Scotia format is preferred for eligible people because it is easier for businesses and organizations to review in places where proof of full vaccination is required to participate in events and activities.

People who are eligible can submit the following information to https://novascotia.ca/vaccineentry :
-- official proof of vaccination for each dose received from another province, territory, state or country
-- health card number
-- government-issued identification

Official proof of vaccination must be issued by the government or organization that administered the vaccine. It should show the name of the government or the name and civic address of the organization. It should also include the name of the vaccine received and the vaccination date.

It will take up to three weeks for eligible people to get their updated proof of vaccination because the information must be verified. It may take longer if more information is required. 

People who are not permanent residents of Nova Scotia and received both doses of vaccine outside the province cannot transfer their records into the Nova Scotia proof of vaccination. This includes visitors, out-of-province students and people who are working here temporarily.

"Seniors and Long-Term Care","Celebrating Nova Scotia Seniors","SENIORS/LONG-TERM CARE--Celebrating Nova Scotia Seniors
----------------------------------------------------------------
Older Nova Scotians continue to make a crucial contribution to our province, and government is committed to helping them remain in their homes as long as possible and ensuring they have the services they need.

This year, Seniors’ Week is October 1-8. Events are planned across the province to celebrate Nova Scotia’s seniors and recognize the impact they have on people and our communities.

“They are business owners who grow our economy. They are elders who pass wisdom to other generations. They are volunteers, caregivers, leaders and so much more,” said Barbara Adams, Minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care. “Older Nova Scotians have earned our respect and deserve the dignity of knowing government will be there to provide solutions that help them remain active and engaged in their communities.”

In the coming weeks, the Province will establish the Seniors’ Care Grant, which will provide $500 for services that will help people stay in their homes longer.

To ensure timely access when long-term care is the best option, the newly elected government is preparing to renovate and build more than 2,500 new single-bed rooms and make sure no couple who is able to be together will be separated.

Amending the Homes for Special Care Act and reinstating the continuing care assistant training grant are also priorities for the newly created Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care.

Quick Facts:
-- by 2030, more than one in four Nova Scotians will be aged 65 and over 
-- one in four Nova Scotians between the ages of 65 and 69 is in the workforce; 25 per cent of them are self-employed entrepreneurs
-- people over 50 have the highest business startup rates; five years after opening, 70 per cent of businesses started by older entrepreneurs are still operating, compared to 28 per cent started by younger people

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The following is a joint announcement with the Province of New Brunswick. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
The following joint news release was issued today, October 4, by the provincial governments of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia:

New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have reached an agreement in principle that would allow Nova Scotia’s Serious Incident Response Team (SiRT) to act as the police oversight body for both provinces.

SiRT is an independent agency that has a mandate to investigate serious matters such as death, serious injury, sexual assault or other public-interest concerns involving the police.

The collaboration ensures both provinces will benefit from SiRT expertise and independent oversight in the interest of public safety. Premier Blaine Higgs and Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston agreed that citizens can be assured these investigations will be undertaken in an efficient, professional manner, as has been and continues to be the case in Nova Scotia.

“We know the importance of having an independent oversight body to investigate serious incidents involving police and we are pleased with this agreement in principle,” said Higgs. “This is an example of how the provinces in our region can work together to ensure we have ready access to the expertise that we need to serve our communities.”

Both provinces have committed to make the necessary changes in legislation and related policies. Additional resources will also be required to support the expanded service. The partnership is expected to start in 2022.

“Citizens need to have confidence that serious incidents involving police are thoroughly and independently investigated. Nova Scotia’s Serious Incident Response Team is highly regarded and we are proud of the work they do,” said Houston. “Collaboration between the provinces promotes and supports public safety in both provinces.”

"Public Works","Off-Highway Vehicle Pilot Extended","PUBLIC WORKS--Off-Highway Vehicle Pilot Extended 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Off-highway vehicle riders will be able to continue lawfully accessing trail connections in designated areas with the extension of the Province’s Off-Highway Vehicle Pilot Project.

“We want to encourage safe and responsible use of off-highway vehicles,” said Public Works Minister Kim Masland. “This extension allows enhanced trail connectivity to continue while an evaluation of the pilot is completed. The results will help inform decisions about the rules and conditions associated with OHVs accessing highways.”

Launched in 2018, the project introduced enhanced trail connectivity in seven pilot communities across the province. Originally set for three years, the pilot was scheduled to end on October 2, 2021.  

The new, two-year extension will allow the Province to evaluate results collected to date to inform a permanent solution for safely allowing off-highway vehicles on portions of roadways.

Safety continues to be paramount, and all off-highway vehicle operators must follow rules and signage and ensure that they have a valid driver’s license and that their off-highway vehicles are registered and insured.  

Through the pilot, riders are permitted to safely access the shoulders of roadways – and roadways themselves where necessary – at specific locations. The intent is to make it easier to safely travel from one trail to another and to access facilities such as gas stations. 

Quick Facts:
-- seven locations throughout the province are designated as pilot communities: Porters Lake, New Germany, Weymouth, Walton, Sherbrooke, Gabarus and Ship Harbour
-- the pilot communities were selected based on factors such as trail connections, traffic volumes, sightlines and posted speed limit

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 pendant la fin de semaine. La mise à jour du lundi inclura les données de la fin de semaine.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 1er octobre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 77 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 61 rétablissements depuis la dernière mise à jour, le 29 septembre.
 
Il y a 51 cas dans le secteur du centre, 13 dans le secteur de l’ouest, 7 dans le secteur de l’est et 6 dans le secteur du nord. 
 
Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.
 
On a avisé les responsables de six écoles d’une ou plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement depuis la dernière mise à jour du 29 septembre. Il est important de noter qu’une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu’il y a une propagation au sein de l’établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus à l’école. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.  

Il y a eu 4 953 cas du 15 mars au 29 septembre 2021. De ce nombre :

-- 187 personnes (3,8 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 310 personnes (6,3 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 4 456 (90,0 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 279 personnes ont été hospitalisées. De ce nombre :

-- 6 personnes (2,2 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 29 personnes (10,4 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 244 personnes (87,5 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

En tout, 31 personnes sont décédées. De ce nombre :

-- 3 personnes (9,7 %) avaient reçu les deux doses du vaccin;
-- 3 personnes (9,7 %) n’avaient reçu qu’une seule dose;
-- 25 personnes (80,6 %) n’étaient pas vaccinées.

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 240 cas actifs de COVID-19. Onze personnes sont hospitalisées, dont quatre aux soins intensifs.

En tout, 4 046 personnes ont subi un test aux cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide à Halifax et à Dartmouth du 24 au 30 septembre.

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 625 tests le 29 septembre et 4 678 tests le 30 septembre.
 
Au 30 septembre, 1 512 263 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 728 168 étaient une deuxième dose.
 
Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 819 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et trois décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 576. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Le gouvernement provincial prolonge l’état d’urgence afin de protéger la santé et la sécurité des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse et d’assurer la continuité des mesures de sécurité et d’autres mesures importantes. L’ordonnance prendra effet à midi le dimanche 3 octobre et sera en vigueur jusqu’à midi le dimanche 17 octobre, à moins que le gouvernement n’y mette fin ou la prolonge.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous dans un centre de dépistage de la COVID-19 de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr.  Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez la liste suivante : https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.
 
On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.
 
Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.
  
Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient composer le 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- En raison du nombre accru de cas qui font l’objet d’une enquête, la catégorie d’exposition (c’est-à-dire voyage, contact étroit ou inconnu) n’est pas toujours disponible au moment de la diffusion du communiqué de presse; la répartition selon les secteurs qui précise les catégories d’exposition ne sera plus fournie régulièrement.   
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 17 octobre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A list of 2021 Treaty Day scholarship and award recipients follows this release
---------------------------------------------------------
The Province is marking its 35th annual Treaty Day today, October 1, by celebrating the many contributions of the Mi’kmaq and recognizing the significance of Nova Scotia’s relationship with Mi’kmaq people.

“We come together today to celebrate the unique and important relationship between the Province and Mi’kmaq in Nova Scotia and our commitment to connect on topics of mutual interest,” said Premier Tim Houston. “I encourage all Nova Scotians to learn more about the history of the Mi’kmaq in our Province.”

Treaty Day award celebrations are hosted by Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc and Grand Chief of the Mi’kmaq Norman Sylliboy. Treaty Day also begins Mi’kmaq History Month.

The achievements of Mi’kmaw Elders and youth are recognized each year on Treaty Day. This year, 13 Elders and young people were honoured with awards and scholarships.

The theme for Mi’kmaq History Month focuses on treaties and the treaty relationship. Nova Scotians can learn more about the contribution of the Mi’kmaq to the province’s history, culture and economy through treaty education programs.

Quotes:
“Through treaty education, we will continue to bring more opportunities to every classroom for all students to understand who the Mi’kmaq are, historically and present day; what the treaties are and why they are important; what happened to the treaty relationship; and help everyone recognize their role in reconciliation. We remain committed to sharing treaty education with public service employees and the public through our memorandum of understanding with Mi’kmaq Kina’matnewey and Millbrook First Nations.”
     - Karla MacFarlane, Minister responsible for the Office of L’nu Affairs

“I want to stress the importance of us gathering together to honour the Treaties and to strengthen the relationships between Mi’kmaq and the Crown. I want to acknowledge the wisdom of our ancestors who laid the foundation for us and our traditional way of life. Our Treaties are sacred to the Mi’kmaq; they are historical and living documents that will continue to guide us for the next seven generations.”
     - Norman Sylliboy, Grand Chief of the Mi’kmaq Grand Council

“The flag-raising ceremony at Government House is far more than an event held every October. This ceremony symbolizes the Crown-Mi’kmaq relationship and demonstrates to all Nova Scotians the importance of honouring the Mi’kmaw people and how their history, heritage and culture are integral parts of today’s Nova Scotia.”
     - Arthur J. LeBlanc, Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia

Quick Facts:
-- Treaty Day began in 1986 with the signing of a proclamation by then Grand Chief Donald Marshall Sr.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Vaccination obligatoire de certains travailleurs de la santé, de l'éducation et d'autres secteurs","Des dizaines de milliers de personnes de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui travaillent dans les secteurs de la santé et de l’éducation doivent être vaccinées en vertu d’une nouvelle politique de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 qui a été annoncée aujourd’hui, le 29 septembre. 

« Même s’il y a une très bonne couverture vaccinale au sein de la population, la pandémie a toujours des conséquences funestes pendant la quatrième vague, a affirmé le premier ministre Tim Houston. Trois décès sont survenus rien que la semaine dernière, et nous devons faire tout notre possible pour que d’autres familles n’aient pas à pleurer la perte d’un de leurs proches. Trop de Néo-Écossais et Néo-Écossaises ont choisi de ne pas se faire vacciner, et certains d’entre eux travaillent avec les personnes les plus vulnérables face à la COVID-19. Il est temps de resserrer les boulons. »

La nouvelle politique de vaccination obligatoire s’applique aux personnes suivantes :
-- les membres du personnel de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse et du IWK Health Centre;
-- les employés des établissements de soins de longue durée (peu importe si ces établissements sont agréés ou pas) et des organismes de soins à domicile (financés par des fonds publics et privés);
-- les enseignants des écoles publiques, les employés de la prématernelle et d’autres membres du personnel scolaire, les employés des centres régionaux pour l’éducation et du Conseil scolaire acadien provincial et les employés qui fournissent des services dans les écoles, notamment les employés de la cafétéria et les conducteurs d’autobus scolaires;
-- les employés des Centres de traitement des troubles de l’audition et du langage de la Nouvelle-Écosse;
-- les employés des établissements résidentiels et des programmes de jour financés par le Programme de soutien aux personnes handicapées du ministère des Services communautaires ainsi que les employés des programmes de soins de jour pour adultes financés par le ministère des Aînés et des Soins de longue durée;
-- les employés des établissements gérés par le ministère des Services communautaires et les personnes qui s’occupent du placement des enfants et des jeunes pris en charge par la ministre des Services communautaires (à l’exclusion des placements en famille d’accueil); 
-- les travailleurs paramédicaux, les infirmières du service de LifeFlight et d’autres employés des Services de santé d’urgence;
-- les médecins et les autres fournisseurs de services aux organismes déjà mentionnés, comme les coiffeurs et les entrepreneurs.

« Notre taux de vaccination n’augmente pas aussi rapidement que ce dont nous avons besoin, et nous constatons les répercussions de la quatrième vague sur les personnes vaccinées et non vaccinées. Des milliers de rendez-vous pour recevoir le vaccin contre la COVID-19 sont offerts à l’heure actuelle. N’attendez pas : fixez votre rendez-vous dès maintenant, a exhorté le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. »

Les employés doivent montrer une preuve de vaccination. S’ils ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés (c’est-à-dire s’ils n’ont reçu aucune dose du vaccin ou s’ils ont seulement reçu une dose), ils doivent participer à un programme d’éducation obligatoire. Ils ont jusqu’au 30 novembre pour recevoir les deux doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

Si un employé n’est pas entièrement vacciné au 30 novembre, il sera mis en congé administratif non payé. Le gouvernement provincial ne fournira pas aux employeurs de fonds supplémentaires pour couvrir les congés administratifs liés au statut vaccinal.

La vaccination complète constituera une condition d’embauche pour les nouveaux employés.

La politique de vaccination obligatoire prévoit une exception médicale pour les employés qui ne peuvent pas se faire vacciner. Or, les raisons médicales requises pour obtenir une exception sont très précises et limitées. Puis, une lettre d’exception ne peut être délivrée que par une infirmière praticienne ou un médecin. 

On encourage tous les milieux de travail à élaborer leur propre politique de vaccination.

Citations
« La décision personnelle de ne pas se faire vacciner a des conséquences très réelles puisqu’il est question de la vie ou de la mort des autres. La Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union souscrit à l’avis des responsables de la Santé publique quant à la politique de vaccination obligatoire. »
     - Janet Hazelton, présidente, Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union

« À l’échelle nationale, 12 membres d’Unifor ont perdu la vie, car ils ont contracté la COVID-19 en milieu de travail. Les responsables d’Unifor comprennent bien l’importance d’une politique de vaccination obligatoire guidée par les responsables et les spécialistes de la Santé publique afin de protéger tout le monde. »  
     - Linda MacNeil, directrice régionale pour la région de l’Atlantique, Unifor

Faits en bref 
-- La nouvelle politique s’applique à plus de 80 000 employés. 
-- En tout, 58 763 personnes admissibles en Nouvelle-Écosse n’ont reçu aucune dose du vaccin contre la COVID-19.

"Health and Wellness / Education and Early Childhood Development / COVID - 19","New Take-Home Test Kits for Pre-primary to Grade 6","COVID-19/EDUCATION/EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT/HEALTH/WELLNESS--New Take-Home Test Kits for Pre-primary to Grade 6
----------------------------------------------------------------
Families of children in pre-primary to Grade 6 in Nova Scotia’s public school system will receive free COVID-19 rapid testing kits in a move to enhance health and safety for unvaccinated children and their families.

Over a thousand volunteers are putting together 80,000 rapid test kits for the pilot program, called Test to Protect Kids. The pilot program will see Nova Scotia provide 320,000 rapid tests to make testing more accessible to families and support early detection of COVID-19.

“We’ve heard from parents that they are concerned about their younger children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated,” said Becky Druhan, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “These take-home tests are one way to provide families easier access to testing for children with symptoms and an added layer of protection on top of the core public health measures that exist in our schools.”

Within the next few weeks, schools will distribute the nose swab testing kits to families who want them. Each package will contain four take-home rapid COVID-19 tests with a set of instructions on how to complete the test.

Public Health wants families to use the test:
-- if it is difficult for a family to get to a COVID-19 testing site and the child has symptoms of COVID-19, or
-- if a child only has one mild symptom and does not need a lab-based PCR test, and
-- if parents and guardians are comfortable doing a shallow nose swab on their child

“Throughout the pandemic we have seen that schools are not a significant source of the spread of COVID-19 cases,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “However, by improving access to testing for children with symptoms, we have a better ability to detect a case early before they have the chance to potentially expose others to the virus in a school setting.”

Schools will provide parents and guardians more information about the pilot program early next week.

Quick Facts:
-- at-home tests can be used on people aged 3 and older with mild COVID-19 symptoms
-- rapid COVID-19 tests are less accurate than a PCR test which means if the rapid test is negative, it needs to be repeated in 48 hours. If the rapid test is positive, it must be confirmed with a PCR COVID-19 test, which can be booked at https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en or by calling 811

"Health and Wellness / Education and Early Childhood Development / COVID - 19","Trousses de tests de dépistage à faire à la maison pour les élèves de la prématernelle à la 6e année","COVID-19/ÉDUCATION ET DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA PETITE ENFANCE/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Trousses de tests de dépistage à faire à la maison pour les élèves de la prématernelle à la 6e année 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Les familles qui ont des enfants de la prématernelle à la sixième année dans le système des écoles publiques de la Nouvelle-Écosse recevront gratuitement des trousses de tests de dépistage à faire à la maison pour améliorer la santé et la sécurité des enfants non vaccinés et de leur famille.

Plus d’un millier de bénévoles ont préparé 80 000 trousses de tests de dépistage rapide pour le programme pilote Des tests pour protéger les enfants. Dans le cadre du programme pilote, la Nouvelle-Écosse fournira 320 000 tests de dépistage rapide pour que les familles aient plus facilement accès au dépistage et pour contribuer à la détection précoce de la COVID-19.

« Les parents nous ont dit qu’ils sont inquiets pour leurs jeunes enfants qui ne sont pas encore admissibles à la vaccination, a dit la ministre de l’Éducation et du Développement de la petite enfance, Becky Druhan. Ces tests à faire à la maison sont un moyen de fournir aux familles un accès plus facile au test de dépistage pour les enfants qui ont des symptômes, et de fournir une mesure supplémentaire de protection en plus des mesures essentielles de santé publique qui existent dans nos écoles. »

Au cours des quelques prochaines semaines, les écoles remettront les trousses de test par prélèvement nasal aux familles qui en veulent. Chaque trousse contiendra quatre tests de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 à faire à la maison ainsi que les instructions nécessaires.

La Santé publique veut qu’une famille utilise le test :
-- s’il est difficile pour la famille de se rendre à un point de dépistage de la COVID-19 et que l’enfant à des symptômes de la maladie ou
-- si l’enfant n’a qu’un symptôme bénin et qu’il n’a pas besoin d’un test PCR analysé en laboratoire et
-- si les parents et les tuteurs sont à l’aise de faire un prélèvement nasal peu profond sur leur enfant. 

« Durant la pandémie, nous avons observé que les écoles ne sont pas une source importante de propagation du virus de la COVID-19, a indiqué le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Toutefois, en améliorant l’accès aux tests de dépistage pour les enfants qui présentent des symptômes, nous sommes mieux en mesure de détecter rapidement un cas avant que l’enfant porteur du virus n’ait l’occasion de peut-être exposer d’autres personnes en milieu scolaire. »

Au début de la semaine prochaine, les écoles fourniront aux parents et aux tuteurs de plus amples renseignements sur le programme pilote.

Faits en bref
-- Les tests à faire à la maison peuvent être utilisés pour les enfants de 3 ans et plus qui ont des symptômes bénins de la COVID-19.
-- Le test de dépistage rapide de la COVID-19 est moins précis qu’un test PCR, ce qui signifie que si le résultat du test de dépistage rapide est négatif, il faut le répéter 48 heures plus tard. Si le résultat du test est positif, il faut le confirmer au moyen d’un test PCR de dépistage de la COVID-19. On prend alors rendez-vous au https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr ou en appelant au 811.

“Despite having a highly vaccinated population, the pandemic is still having deadly consequences in the fourth wave,” said Premier Tim Houston. “There have been three deaths in the last week alone and we need to do whatever we can to make sure other families don’t have to grieve their loved ones. Too many Nova Scotians have chosen not to get vaccinated, and some of them work with Nova Scotians most at risk from COVID-19. It is time to get tough.”

The new vaccine mandate applies to:
-- Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre
-- workers in long-term care facilities (licensed and unlicensed) and home-care agencies (publicly and privately funded)
-- public school teachers, pre-primary and other school-based staff, regional and board office staff, and those providing services in schools, including cafeteria and school bus services
-- Hearing and Speech Nova Scotia
-- workers in residential facilities and day programs funded by the Department of Community Services Disability Support Program and adult day programs funded by Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care
-- workers in Department of Community Services facilities and those providing placements for children and youth in the care of the Minister of Community Services (excluding foster family placements) 
-- paramedics, LifeFlight nurses and some other staff at EHS
-- physicians and other service providers to the above organizations; for example hairdressers and contractors

“Our vaccination rate is not increasing as fast as we need, and we are seeing the impact of the fourth wave on those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated. There are thousands of appointments available for vaccination right now. Don’t wait – book today,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health.

Employees must show proof of vaccination. If not fully vaccinated (zero or one dose), they must participate in a mandatory education program. They have until November 30 to be fully vaccinated.

If an employee is not fully vaccinated by November 30, they will be placed on unpaid administrative leave. Government will not provide employers with any additional funding to cover administrative leaves of absence related to vaccine status.

Full vaccination will be a hiring condition for new staff.

The vaccine mandate allows for a medical exception for staff who are unable to be vaccinated. However, the medical reasons required for an exception are very specific and limited. An exception letter can only be issued by a nurse practitioner or physician. 

All workplaces are encouraged to develop their own vaccine policies.

Quotes:
""An individual’s personal decision not to get vaccinated has tangible implications – life and death consequences – for others. The Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union supports the advice of public health officials regarding mandatory vaccination policies.""
     - Janet Hazelton, president, Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union

“Nationally 12 Unifor members have lost their lives to COVID-19 that was contracted in the workplace. Unifor fully understands the importance of mandatory vaccination policies guided by public health officials and experts to protect individuals and others around us.”  
     - Linda MacNeil, Unifor Atlantic Regional Director

Quick Facts: 
-- The new policy covers more than 80,000 employees
-- 58,763 eligible people in Nova Scotia have not had any doses of the COVID-19 vaccine

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Une approche prudente pour entamer la cinquième phase","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Une approche prudente pour entamer la cinquième phase
------------------------------------------------------
La cinquième phase du plan de déconfinement de la Nouvelle-Écosse débutera le 4 octobre avec une approche prudente. La plupart des restrictions seront levées, mais certaines restrictions devront rester en place et des restrictions à l'entrée dans la province seront ajoutées pour les gens en provenance de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard et de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador.

Voici les aspects importants de la cinquième phase :
-- Le port du masque demeurera obligatoire dans les endroits publics intérieurs.
-- Les restrictions liées à l'éloignement physique et aux rassemblements pour les événements organisés par une entreprise ou un organisme reconnu seront levées.
-- Les rassemblements informels demeureront limités à 25 personnes à l'intérieur et 50 personnes à l'extérieur.
-- Une preuve de vaccination complète sera exigée pour la participation à des activités et des événements non essentiels.

« Le variant Delta a eu une incidence sur notre épidémiologie. La quatrième vague déferle sur le pays, et elle est maintenant arrivée en Nouvelle-Écosse, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Nous pouvons lever certaines restrictions grâce à la protection supplémentaire accordée par la preuve de vaccination complète et notre taux élevé de vaccination, mais le port du masque et les restrictions imposées aux rassemblements informels doivent rester en place. Nous adoptons une approche prudente pour pouvoir continuer d'aller de l'avant, même pendant la quatrième vague. »

À compter de minuit une minute le 4 octobre, une preuve de vaccination complète sera exigée pour les personnes de 12 ans et plus qui souhaitent participer à des activités et à des événements discrétionnaires et non essentiels qui réunissent des groupes de gens, par exemple aller au restaurant ou au cinéma, assister à une activité sportive ou à une pièce de théâtre, participer à des activités sociales et aller au gymnase.

Selon des conversations qui ont eu lieu avec des gens de plusieurs secteurs au cours de la dernière semaine, certains changements ont été apportés à la liste des endroits où une preuve de vaccination complète sera exigée. Par exemple, la preuve de vaccination ne sera pas exigée pour l'accès général à une bibliothèque, mais elle sera exigée pour la participation aux programmes offerts par la bibliothèque qui réunissent des groupes de gens. La preuve de vaccination sera exigée pour les gens qui souhaitent manger à l'intérieur des établissements de restauration rapide, mais non pour le service de mets pour emporter, la livraison, le service au volant et les aires de restauration.

La preuve de vaccination ne sera pas exigée en vertu de la politique provinciale pour le personnel des entreprises et des organismes qui organisent ces événements et ces activités, mais elle sera exigée pour leurs bénévoles. On encourage les entreprises et les organismes à établir leurs propres politiques sur la vaccination. L'élaboration de telles politiques doit tenir compte des questions juridiques et éthiques. Les personnes qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinées doivent avoir accès aux services essentiels.

La politique sur la preuve de vaccination complète et des ressources à l'intention des entreprises et des organismes auxquels s'applique la politique se trouvent au http://novascotia.ca/POV/fr.

À compter de 8 heures le 4 octobre, toute personne qui arrive en Nouvelle-Écosse d'une autre province ou d'un territoire du Canada doit remplir le formulaire Contrôle-santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Les exigences en matière d'isolement dépendent du statut vaccinal et du résultat au test de dépistage. Les personnes qui sont entièrement vaccinées au moins 14 jours avant d'arriver dans la province n'ont pas à s'isoler, mais le test de dépistage est recommandé. Les gens qui ne sont pas entièrement vaccinés doivent s'isoler pendant au moins sept jours et obtenir deux résultats négatifs au test de dépistage en Nouvelle-Écosse pour mettre fin à l'isolement après sept jours. Il doit s'agir de tests analysés en laboratoire et non de tests rapides.

« Les restrictions imposées à l'entrée dans la province ont été essentielles à notre succès dans la gestion de la pandémie jusqu'à présent, et nous devons les renforcer pour l'instant en raison de la quatrième vague, particulièrement dans les provinces de l'Atlantique, souligne le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. La preuve de vaccination complète sera un autre outil important pour assurer la sécurité des gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse pendant la quatrième vague. Je remercie les entreprises et les organismes qui nous ont aidés à mettre en oeuvre les mesures de santé publique pendant la pandémie. Faites preuve de gentillesse lorsqu'on vous demande votre preuve de vaccination. Il s'agit d'une exigence législative nécessaire pour pouvoir participer à des activités et à des événements discrétionnaires. »

Faits en bref
-- Les gens qui ne peuvent pas recevoir le vaccin pour une raison médicale valide peuvent obtenir une lettre d'exemption de leur médecin ou de leur infirmière praticienne et présenter cette lettre au lieu d'une preuve de vaccination.
-- Un faible nombre de personnes qui ont participé à des essais cliniques pour le vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont déjà reçu une lettre d'exemption qu'elles peuvent présenter au lieu d'une preuve de vaccination complète.
-- Les enfants qui ont eu 12 ans entre le 1er janvier et le 4 octobre cette année pourront assister à des événements et des activités jusqu'au 31 décembre pendant le processus de vaccination. Les enfants qui auront 12 ans après le 4 octobre auront trois mois suivant leur anniversaire pour se faire vacciner.
-- Les jeunes de 13 à 18 ans qui ont reçu leur première dose du vaccin peuvent participer à des activités sportives, récréatives, artistiques et culturelles et devront recevoir leur deuxième dose au plus tard le 26 octobre.
-- L'état d'urgence demeurera en vigueur dans la province jusqu'à nouvel ordre.

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Phase 5 Starting with Cautious Approach","COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS--Phase 5 Starting with Cautious Approach
-------------------------------------------------------
Phase 5 of Nova Scotia’s reopening plan is starting October 4 with a cautious approach. While most restrictions will be lifted, some will be maintained, and border restrictions will be added for people coming from Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Some notable aspects of Phase 5 include:
-- masks will continue to be mandatory in indoor public places
-- physical distancing and gathering limits for events hosted by a recognized business or organization will be lifted
-- the informal gathering limits of 25 people indoors and 50 outdoors will remain in place
-- proof of full vaccination will be required for non-essential events and activities

“The Delta variant has impacted our epidemiology. The fourth wave is taking its toll across the country and it’s now in Nova Scotia,” said Premier Tim Houston. “We can lift some restrictions with the added protection of the proof of full vaccine protocol and our high vaccination rates, but masking and limits for informal gatherings need to stay in place. We’re taking a cautious approach so we can keep moving forward, even in the midst of the fourth wave.”

Starting at 12:01 a.m. on October 4, proof of full vaccination will be required for people who are 12 and older to participate in discretionary, non-essential events and activities that gather people together, such as going to restaurants, movies, sports events, theatre performances, social events and the gym.

Based on conversations with people in many sectors in the past week, some changes have been made in the list of places where proof of full vaccination will be required. For example, proof of vaccination will not be required for general library access but will be required to participate in library programs that bring groups of people together. It will apply to dining in at fast-food establishments, but not to takeout, delivery, drive-thru or food courts.

Proof of vaccination will not be required under the provincewide protocol for employees of businesses and organizations that offer these events and activities, but it will be required for their volunteers. Businesses and organizations are encouraged to set their own vaccination policies. Any policies should take legal and ethical implications into consideration. People who are not fully vaccinated need to be able to access essential services.

The proof of full vaccination protocol and resources for businesses and organizations where it applies are available at: http://novascotia.ca/POV

Effective at 8 a.m. on October 4, everyone coming to Nova Scotia from other Canadian provinces and territories will need to complete the Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form. Their isolation will be based on vaccination status and testing. People who were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arriving do not have to isolate, but testing is recommended. People who are not fully vaccinated must isolate for at least seven days and get two negative test results in Nova Scotia to stop isolating after seven days. They must be lab-based tests, not rapid tests.

“Our border measures have been integral to our success in managing the pandemic to date, and we need to strengthen them right now given the fourth wave activity, particularly in the Atlantic region,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “The proof of full vaccination requirement will be another important tool to keep Nova Scotians safe through the fourth wave. I want to thank the businesses and organizations who have helped us implement public health measures throughout this pandemic. Please be kind when they ask you to show your proof – the law will require it, and they will have to check before you can participate in discretionary events and activities.”

Quick Facts:
-- people with a valid medical reason that prevents vaccination can get an exception letter from their physician or nurse practitioner to show instead of proof of full vaccination
-- a small number of Nova Scotians who participated in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials have already been sent an exception letter to show instead of proof of full vaccination
-- children who turned 12 between January 1 and October 4 this year will have until Dec. 31 to attend events and activities while they get vaccinated; children who turn 12 after October 4 will have three months from their birthday
-- youth who are 13 to 18 years old and have proof that they received one dose of vaccine can participate in sport, recreation, arts and culture programming and have until October 26 to get their second dose
-- the provincial state of emergency will continue to be in effect until further notice

----------------------------------------------------------------
REMARQUE : Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Écosse ne publie pas de communiqués sur la COVID-19 et ne fait pas la mise à jour du tableau de bord sur la COVID-19 les jours fériés. La mise à jour de vendredi inclura les données de jeudi.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd'hui 29 septembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse signale 41 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 21 rétablissements.
 
Trente-deux cas ont été dépistés dans le secteur du centre, quatre cas dans le secteur du nord, trois cas dans le secteur de l'est et deux cas dans le secteur de l'ouest. 
 
Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.
 
Le 28 septembre, on a avisé trois écoles d'une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Il est important de noter qu'une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu'il y a une propagation au sein de l'établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus dans l'école. Comme toujours, on informe tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l'école pendant qu'elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d'exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l'adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures.

Aujourd'hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 224 cas actifs de COVID-19. Douze personnes sont hospitalisées dans des unités de traitement de la COVID-19, dont deux aux soins intensifs.

Le 28 septembre, les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 5 720 tests.
 
Au 28 septembre, 1 505 975 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 724 772 étaient une deuxième dose.
 
Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 742 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et trois décès. L'âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 515. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests
 
Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage dans un centre d'évaluation primaire de la province à l'adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr. Pour savoir si vous êtes admissibles aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez le https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l'une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s'ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.
 
On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s'isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.
 
Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu'elle était un contact étroit d'un cas positif doit s'isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d'être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d'exposition, elle n'est pas tenue de s'isoler tant qu'elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l'affût de symptômes jusqu'à 14 jours après la date d'exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s'isoler jusqu'à ce qu'elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.
 
Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l'heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s'aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s'ils n'ont pas accès à l'auto-évaluation en ligne ou s'ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s'isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- En raison du nombre accru de cas qui font l'objet d'une enquête, la catégorie d'exposition (c’est-à-dire voyage, contact étroit ou inconnu) n'est pas toujours disponible au moment de la diffusion du communiqué de presse; la répartition selon les secteurs qui précise les catégories d'exposition ne sera plus fournie régulièrement.   
-- L'état d'urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu'au 3 octobre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Nova Scotia is not issuing COVID-19 news releases or updating the COVID-19 data dashboard on holidays. Friday updates will include Thursday data.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Today, September 29, Nova Scotia is reporting 41 new cases of COVID-19 and 21 recoveries.
 
There are 32 cases in Central Zone, four cases in Northern Zone, three cases in Eastern Zone and two cases in Western Zone. 
 
There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.
 
On September 28, three schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 224 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 12 people are in hospital, including two in ICU.

On September 28, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 5,720 tests.
 
As of September 28, 1,505,975 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 724,772 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.
 
Since August 1, there have been 742 positive COVID-19 cases and three deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 515 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:
 
Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet this criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.
 
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.
 
Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.
 
Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- due to an increased number of investigations, the exposure category (i.e., travel, close contact or under investigation) is not always available by release time; a breakdown by zone identifying exposure categories will no longer be provided regularly  
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 3, 2021

"Finance and Treasury Board","First 2021-22 Budget Update","FINANCE/TREASURY BOARD--First 2021-22 Budget Update
----------------------------------------------------------
The first update on Budget 2021-22 shows government’s commitment to making key investments in priority areas, such as health care, roads, students and seniors.

Finance and Treasury Board Minister Allan MacMaster presented the update today, September 29. Government is forecasting a deficit of $444.5 million for the 2021-22 fiscal year, a $140.4 million change from the $584.9 million deficit presented in March.

“We’ve heard from Nova Scotians, and they’ve given government a clear mandate,” said Minister MacMaster. “Now is the time to take action and make investments that will improve the lives of Nova Scotians across our province.”

Additional appropriations totalling $423.7 million are required for 16 departments and offices. Most of those expenses are related to the COVID-19 pandemic response and new funding for federally recoverable programming.

As part of the update, Minister MacMaster also announced that government will be paying the bonds related to the Cobequid Pass toll highway early. This is the first step to fulfilling government’s commitment to remove the tolls. The Department of Public Works will immediately begin further planning for their removal.

Additionally, Minister MacMaster announced that government will invest $32 million in a new Seniors’ Care Grant. The program will provide support to help seniors stay in their homes. More information about the program will be announced in the coming weeks.

The Province is also investing $2.3 million in the education system, putting a priority on student and staff health and well-being with three new initiatives: the Healthy School Fund, a diversity-centred teacher professional development program and a commitment to provide every classroom in Nova Scotia with a mental health resource kit.

In total, government is investing more than $80 million in programs and initiatives to 
support key priorities identified in ministers' mandate letters.

Quick Facts:
-- total revenue is projected to be $12.19 billion, up $406.8 million from budget, mainly due to an increase in personal income tax, a one-time increase to the Canada Health Transfer and a one-time increase in federal funding for the Offshore Accord
-- departmental expenses are projected to be $11.91 billion, up $397.1 million from budget, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and new funding for federally recoverable programming

The rate for 2020-21 was 89 per cent, the highest in three years.

“Providing Nova Scotians with timely access to the information they want and need is the cornerstone of a government that is transparent and accountable,” said Colton LeBlanc, Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services. “Building on these achievements, we will work with the Department of Justice to fulfill government’s mandate to amend the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.”

The annual report provides statistics about government responses to FOIPOP applications and outlines work being done to support compliance by government. The report is available at: https://beta.novascotia.ca/documents/information-access-and-privacy-services-annual-report-2020-2021

Quick Facts:
-- there were 2,039 FOIPOP applications received in 2020-21
-- 70 per cent of the requests were submitted through the new online Information Access and Privacy Services Request Account launched in January 2021
-- there were 213,000 pages of records released last year, with the largest single release being 9,788 pages
-- the Department of Environment received the highest number of applications with 863 requests
-- amending the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act to give order-making ability to the privacy commissioner is part of the mandate of the justice minister

"Health and Wellness / COVID - 19","Un décès, 32 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 28 cas résolus","COVID-19/SANTÉ ET MIEUX-ÊTRE--Un décès, 32 nouveaux cas de COVID-19, 28 cas résolus
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aujourd’hui 28 septembre, la Nouvelle-Écosse annonce un décès lié à la COVID-19. Un septuagénaire est décédé dans le secteur du nord. 

« Une autre famille éprouve la perte d’un être cher, et j’offre toutes mes condoléances aux personnes endeuillées au nom des Néo-Écossais et Néo-Écossaises, affirme le premier ministre Tim Houston. Ce virus est dangereux et il peut entraîner des conséquences désastreuses. Fournissez votre part d’efforts et faites-vous vacciner, si cela n’est pas déjà fait. Ensemble, nous pouvons freiner la propagation du virus. »
 
La Nouvelle-Écosse signale également 32 nouveaux cas de COVID-19 et 28 rétablissements.
 
Il y a 27 cas dans le secteur du centre, trois cas dans le secteur du nord et deux cas dans le secteur de l’est. 
 
Il y a de la transmission communautaire dans le secteur du centre, principalement chez les personnes de 20 à 40 ans qui ne sont pas vaccinées et qui participent à des activités sociales.

« Je pense aux personnes dans le deuil et je prie pour elles, a souligné le Dr Robert Strang, médecin-hygiéniste en chef de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Le vaccin peut prévenir des symptômes graves, l’hospitalisation et la mort. J’encourage tout le monde à recevoir les deux doses du vaccin pour continuer de se protéger et de protéger les gens qui les entourent. »  
 
Le 27 septembre, on a avisé les responsables de sept écoles d’une ou de plusieurs expositions au sein de leur établissement. Il est important de noter qu’une exposition liée à une école ne signifie pas qu’il y a une propagation au sein de l’établissement ou que la personne touchée a été exposée au virus à l’école. Comme toujours, on informe d’abord tous les membres du personnel, les parents et les tuteurs des expositions si une personne ayant un cas confirmé de COVID-19 (élève, enseignant ou membre du personnel) se trouvait à l’école pendant qu’elle était contagieuse. La liste des cas d’exposition à la COVID-19 liés aux écoles est disponible en ligne à l’adresse suivante : https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/fr/school-exposures. 

Aujourd’hui, la Nouvelle-Écosse compte 205 cas actifs de COVID-19. Treize personnes sont hospitalisées, dont une aux soins intensifs. 

Les laboratoires de la Régie de la santé de la Nouvelle-Écosse ont analysé 4 947 tests le 27 septembre. 
 
Au 27 septembre, 1 503 065 doses du vaccin contre la COVID-19 ont été administrées. De ce nombre, 723 167 étaient une deuxième dose.
 
Depuis le 1er août, la Nouvelle-Écosse a enregistré 702 cas confirmés de COVID-19 et trois décès. L’âge des personnes touchées va de moins de 10 ans à plus de 90 ans. Le nombre de cas résolus se chiffre maintenant à 494. Le nombre cumulatif de cas pourrait changer à mesure que les données sont actualisées dans le système Panorama.

Conseils au sujet des tests

Les gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse qui présentent ou non des symptômes peuvent prendre rendez-vous dans un centre de dépistage de la COVID-19 de la province à l’adresse https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr.  Pour savoir si vous êtes admissible aux tests de dépistage pour personnes asymptomatiques, consultez la liste suivante : https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site (en anglais seulement). On encourage les gens asymptomatiques qui ne répondent pas à ces critères à utiliser l’une des cliniques temporaires de dépistage rapide s’ils veulent se faire tester. Des unités mobiles de santé publique permettent aussi de passer un test de dépistage sans rendez-vous; cela sera indiqué dans les annonces.
 
On conseille à toute personne qui présente des symptômes de la COVID-19 de s’isoler et de fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.
 
Toute personne à qui la Santé publique a dit qu’elle était un contact étroit d’un cas positif doit s’isoler pendant 14 jours complets, peu importe le résultat du test, à moins d’être entièrement vaccinée. Si la personne est entièrement vaccinée au moins 14 jours avant la date d’exposition, elle n’est pas tenue de s’isoler tant qu’elle ne présente aucun symptôme de la COVID-19. Elle devrait tout de même se faire tester et être à l’affût de symptômes jusqu’à 14 jours après la date d’exposition. Si des symptômes apparaissent, elle doit se faire tester et s’isoler jusqu’à ce qu’elle reçoit un résultat négatif au test de dépistage.
 
Symptômes et auto-évaluation

Consultez le https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/fr pour effectuer une auto-évaluation si vous avez eu, au cours des 48 dernières heures, ou si vous avez à l’heure actuelle : 

-- une toux (nouvelle ou qui s’aggrave)

ou au moins deux des symptômes suivants :

-- une fièvre (frissons, sueurs)
-- un mal de tête
-- un écoulement nasal ou une congestion nasale
-- un mal de gorge
-- un essoufflement ou une difficulté respiratoire

Les gens devraient appeler au 811 s’ils n’ont pas accès à l’auto-évaluation en ligne ou s’ils souhaitent parler de leurs symptômes à une infirmière.

Toute personne qui présente des symptômes doit s’isoler immédiatement et fixer un rendez-vous pour un test de dépistage.

Faits en bref
-- En raison du nombre accru de cas qui font l’objet d’une enquête, la catégorie d’exposition (c’est-à-dire voyage, contact étroit ou inconnu) n’est pas toujours disponible au moment de la diffusion du communiqué de presse; la répartition selon les secteurs qui précise les catégories d’exposition ne sera plus fournie régulièrement.   
-- L’état d’urgence a été déclaré le 22 mars 2020 en vertu de la loi sur la gestion des urgences (Emergency Management Act) et a récemment été prolongé jusqu’au 3 octobre 2021.

----------------------------------------------------------
Today, September 28, Nova Scotia is reporting one death related to COVID-19. A man in his 70s in Northern Zone has died.

“Another family is suffering the loss of a loved one, and on behalf of all Nova Scotians, I offer our condolences to those grieving,” said Premier Tim Houston. “This virus is serious and can have devastating impacts. Do your part and get vaccinated if you haven’t done so already. Together we can slow the spread of the virus.”
 
Nova Scotia is also reporting 32 new cases of COVID-19 and 28 recoveries.
 
There are 27 cases in Central Zone, three cases in Northern Zone and two cases in Eastern Zone. 
 
There is community spread in Central Zone, primarily among people aged 20 to 40 who are unvaccinated and participating in social activities.

“My thoughts and prayers are with those who are grieving the loss of their loved one,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “The vaccine can help prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death. I urge Nova Scotians to get both doses and continue to protect themselves and the people around them.”  
 
On September 27, seven schools were notified of an exposure(s) at their school. It is important to note that an exposure associated with a school does not mean there is spread within the school or that the initial case was first exposed to the virus in the school. As always, all staff, parents and guardians are notified of exposures if a positive case (student, teacher or staff) was at the school while infectious. A list of schools with exposures is available online: https://backtoschool.ednet.ns.ca/school-exposures

As of today, Nova Scotia has 205 active cases of COVID-19. Of those, 13 people are in hospital, including one in ICU.

On September 27, Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 4,947 tests.
 
As of September 27, 1,503,065 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 723,167 Nova Scotians have received their second dose.
 
Since August 1, there have been 702 positive COVID-19 cases and three deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 494 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Testing advice:
 
Nova Scotians with or without symptoms can book a test at: https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/en for COVID-19 for COVID-19 testing centres across the province. Those eligible to receive asymptomatic testing are listed at: https://www.nshealth.ca/visit-covid-19-testing-site . Those with no symptoms who do not meet this criteria are encouraged to use one of the rapid testing pop-up sites if they want to be tested. Some public health mobile unit clinics also offer drop-in testing; this will be noted in promotions.
 
Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms is advised to self-isolate and book a COVID-19 test.
 
Anyone advised by public health that they were a close contact needs to complete a full 14-day quarantine, regardless of test results, unless they are fully vaccinated. If they are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before the exposure date, they do not need to self-isolate as long as they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. They should still get tested and should monitor for symptoms up to 14 days after the exposure date. If symptoms develop, they should get tested and self-isolate until they receive a negative test result.
 
Symptoms and self-assessment:

Nova Scotians should visit https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/ to do a self-assessment if in the past 48 hours they have had or are currently experiencing:

-- cough (new or worsening)

Or two or more of the following symptoms:

-- fever (chills, sweats)
-- headache
-- runny nose or nasal congestion
-- sore throat
-- shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

People should call 811 if they cannot access the online self-assessment or wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms.

Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate and book a test.

Quick Facts:
-- due to an increased number of investigations, the exposure category (i.e., travel, close contact or under investigation) is not always available by release time; a breakdown by zone identifying exposure categories will no longer be provided regularly  
-- a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22, 2020, and has been extended to October 3, 2021

----------------------------------------------------------------
Remarque : la liste des médaillés des Services de santé d’urgence figure à la fin du présent communiqué.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Des employés de première ligne des Services de santé d’urgence, dont une personne ayant 45 années de service, ont été mis à l’honneur lors d’une cérémonie virtuelle préenregistrée de remise des médailles pour souligner leurs longs états de service.

« La pandémie de COVID-19 a posé de nombreux défis, et vous avez intensifié vos efforts, vous vous êtes adaptés et vous êtes venus en aide aux gens de la Nouvelle-Écosse, a affirmé Michelle Thompson, ministre de la Santé et du Mieux-être. Je tiens à remercier les médaillés de cette année pour leurs nombreuses années de service et de dévouement. »

La cérémonie annuelle a permis de reconnaître 132 personnes pour leur longue carrière, soit 3 800 années cumulées à sauver des vies et à venir en aide aux gens des quatre coins de la province. 

Pour être admissible à recevoir une médaille cette année, une personne devait avoir au moins 20 ans de temps accumulé dans les programmes de service des ambulances terrestres ou de LifeFlight et être membre en règle du College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia.

Un travailleur paramédical, Judah Goldstein, a reçu le premier Prix Tom-Dobson, nommé en l’honneur d’un travailleur paramédical très respecté qui a eu une brillante carrière de 23 ans au sein des Services de santé d’urgence et qui est décédé subitement en 2020. Ce prix annuel récompense un employé dont le travail a contribué à améliorer les soins aux patients et à permettre la pleine portée et l’utilisation de la profession paramédicale dans toute la Nouvelle-Écosse.  

Faits en bref
-- Il y a 145 ambulances et environ 1 200 travailleurs paramédicaux des Services de santé d’urgence en Nouvelle-Écosse.
-- Les travailleurs paramédicaux des Services de santé d’urgence répondent à environ 175 000 appels par an pour des urgences et des transferts de patients.
-- Des travailleurs paramédicaux d’Halifax participent au programme de soins paramédicaux prolongés, qui permet aux résidents des foyers de soins infirmiers d’être traités chez eux plutôt qu’aux urgences.
-- Un programme de visites à domicile (connu sous le nom de « VISIT » en anglais) permet aux travailleurs paramédicaux de la vallée de l’Annapolis de prendre des nouvelles de certaines personnes âgées désignées par les médecins de la région.
-- Un programme de soins paramédicaux communautaire dans la Municipalité régionale du Cap-Breton offre un soutien aux patients après leur congé de l’hôpital.

"Health and Wellness","Emergency Health Services Employees Honoured","HEALTH/WELLNESS--Emergency Health Services Employees Honoured
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: A list of Emergency Health Services employees receiving the award follows this release.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Emergency Health Services (EHS) front-line staff – including one person with 45 years of service – were honoured through a pre-recorded virtual EHS Long Service Award ceremony.

“The COVID-19 pandemic created many challenges and you stepped up, adapted to the changes, and answered Nova Scotians’ calls for help,” said Health and Wellness Minister Michelle Thompson. “I’d like to thank this year’s award recipients for their many years of service and dedication.”

The annual ceremony recognized 132 people for their long-service commitments with a combined 3,800 years of saving lives and coming to the aid of Nova Scotians across the province. 

To qualify for this year’s medal, a staff member needed a minimum of 20 years of accumulated time working in the ground ambulance or EHS LifeFlight programs and had to be registered and in good standing with the College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia.

One paramedic, Judah Goldstein, received the inaugural Tom Dobson Award, named in honour of a highly regarded paramedic who had a distinguished 23-year career at EHS and who passed away suddenly in 2020. The annual award recognizes an employee whose work has helped enhance patient care and enable full scope and utilization of the paramedic profession across Nova Scotia.  

Quick Facts:
-- there are 145 ambulances and about 1,200 EHS paramedics in Nova Scotia
-- EHS paramedics respond to approximately 175,000 calls each year for emergencies and patient transfers
-- paramedics in Halifax participate in the Extended Care Paramedic Program, which allows nursing-home residents to be treated in their home rather than in an emergency department
-- a check-in program called VISIT allows paramedics in the Annapolis Valley to check in on some seniors identified by local doctors
-- a community-based paramedic program in Cape Breton Regional Municipality offers support to patients after they are released from hospital
