Description: 
This is a non-owner-occupied airbnb with an illegal permit. We have lived at our home for almost two years now and have only seen the owner of this home one time (when we first moved in). We filed a complaint here a month or so ago about a 100+ lb dog staying outside 24/7 at this airbnb barking incessantly at all hours of the day/night. A representative from the city asked us if we would like to shut their unit down in violation of their permit,  we decided not to at the time but as of last night we have ABSOLUTELY changed our minds...... Last night a 2:30AM, an airbnb guest who was drunk out of his mind tried to break into our home. (we didn't know at the time that he was a guest next-door...  for all we knew he was some random crazy person). He pounded on our front doors and windows, screaming obscenities and telling us to let him in. When we didn't, he jumped our 6-ft privacy fence into our backyard and tried to kick in our back door. He threw patio furniture at our back door and started threatening with violence. He broke our back door jamb but never got inside.  We called 911 and they came and we have filed a police report. Please help us shut this illegal airbnb down. Thank you!

Description: 
Frequently one of the pipes in my apartment complex hallway breaks and the whole apartment gets flooded. This happens too often and the current management company does nothing to fully address the situation to the point that it keeps happening. There's a significant part of the ceiling missing because the pipes have had issues for years. So many of my neighbors are experiencing the same. The leaks from the pipes led to massive humidity, which rotted the ceiling. Now we have constant leaks. We told the manager and the manager just put a plastic bucket under the leak.

Description: 
This house is in an out of state trust and appears to be being rented.  It has been an eyesore ever since the tornado.  There still is junk in the back driveway. Don't think this house was EVER restored after the flood correctly.  Was abandoned for a long while.    Never saw anyone there drying it out  properly and probably has mold.

The grassy areas along the roadside on Greeley and West Hillwood are hardly ever cut (not able to get photos of those specifics). Also piles lawn debris directly in the drainage ditch (on the West Hillwood side), which prevents rainfall from flowing as needed through the ditch and neighboring culvert.

Description: 
Hi - There has been a large pile of mulch in the alleyway between Utah and Nebraska and 44th and 42nd. It also extends into the alleyway. I believe the pile has been there for over 12 months. It is growing weeds. Can it be removed or requested to be cleaned up?

Description: 
Hello and thank you for your time and consideration regarding my request.

The residential unit at 1627 Marshall Hollow Drive has a permanent structure (see attached photos of said structure in various states of disrepair) affixed to the roof. The structure rises well above the height of the roof line. I have provided the builders blueprint for reference. 
I used the E-Permits website and could not find where the resident, or builder, applied for a building permit. 

My hope is that this permanent structure is removed.

Best regards,

Cary Songer

Description: 
investor purchased property about a year ago, rented the house for awhile, but it has been empty for 2-3 months and the grass hasn't been mowed since that time.  This is causing a lot of unwanted bugs/wildlife and overgrowth to my property.  Due to the unkept condition of the property, it is obvious to passers by that the homes are vacant.  We caught what appeared to be a homeless person trying to break into the property about a month ago and the police came out to investigate.
