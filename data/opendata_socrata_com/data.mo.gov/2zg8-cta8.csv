Nestled into a creek bottom, the ridge around us provides a lovely backdrop. We call our farm home and enjoy having several hives of honey bees, a native Missouri meadow, vegetable gardens in the summer, and lots of fruit. In 2012, with the help of an amazing group of family and friends, we planted one acre of blueberries. Two years later we expanded by planting one acre of blackberries. By 2015 we opened for our first season of picking blueberries and blackberries.","We have six varieties of blueberries which allows for an extended picking season. The two varieties of blackberries on our farm are thornless and make for easy picking. Our honey is raw and unfiltered, making it perfect for those seeking the benefits of a locally produced honey.","Farm hours vary throughout the week depending on weather and mostly the amount of ripe fruit. It&#39;s best to check our website before visiting. Our season usually runs from early to mid June through July. All the fruit at our farm is u-pick and you pay by the pound for what you pick. We are members of the Columbia Farmers&#39; Market and can be found there on Saturday mornings. Be sure to arrive for the opening bell as fruit tends to go quickly!","(38.912013, -91.954196)"

To start, we feed produce year-round from Buckeye Acres Produce in Warrensburg, MO. The variety of feed the pigs enjoy from day to day are: tomatoes, squash, pumpkins, watermelons, peppers, apples, cucumbers, eggplant and sweetcorn. In addition to the vegetables, our pigs recycle non-alcoholic grains from making whiskey from Restless Spirits Distillery and beer from Cinder Block Brewery. On the farm, this warm treat is known as &quot;pig oatmeal&quot;�. Waste bread, hard boiled eggs, and free choice pasture and hay are also farm favorites. To balance the buffet variety in their diet, we have a custom, antibiotic-free feed mixed for our farm by Vast Feeds in Warrensburg, MO. The significant assortment in their nutrition contributes to tastier pork along with heritage genetics. The longer growth time for these &quot;non-commercialized&quot;� psig allow for further flavor development and richer color of the pork.<br><br>When you&#39;re ready to take your pork to the next level, call us.
