"29691","Enhance Student Retention at Community Colleges","19500000","2.37 - Economic Impact Assistance Other","In response to declining student achievement retention and a corresponding loss of tuition and fee revenue that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Connecticut community colleges are implementing Guided Pathways Advising, a wholistic case management advising model.  With partial support from State Fiscal Relief funding, Guided Pathways Advising will be implemented at scale across all 12 Connecticut community colleges beginning in FY 2022. Under the program, Connecticut community colleges will hire 158 advisors and eight other supervisory and support staff over a 3-year period.","Research shows that individualized, intrusive advising and long-term mentorship experiences that involve goal setting, the learning of personal success strategies, intentional conversation, and positive connection can increase students’ sense of belonging, engagement, achievement, persistence, retention and completion (Achieving the Dream, 2018; Bettinger & Baker, 2011; Karp & Stacey, 2013; Miller & Murray, 2005; Pierce, 2016). Many exemplar community colleges have implemented advising models similar to Connecticut’s GPA program and observed significantly higher retention and graduation rates. At Lorain County Community College, for example, the graduation rate jumped from 8 percent to 25 percent within seven years (Dryden, 2018) and the equity gap in developmental course completion rates and first-term credit accrual has also narrowed (Ohio Higher Ed, 2018). At the Alamo Colleges District, in less than six years since the launch of their Alamo ADVISE model, time to degree completion decreased from 4.6 to 3.9 years, and the average number of credit hours at completion fell from 92 to 82 hours (Excelencia in Education, 2020). Furthermore, Austin Community College saw a 15.5 percent increase in term-to-term retention upon implementing its own Guided Pathways Advising and Coaching initiative; distance learning students saw the highest gains in retention (24 percent) among all demographics (Ashford, 2019).","Program implementation ongoing
Metrics to be tracked include:
-Number of staff to be hired
-Number of students advised"

This allocation from Connecticut's State Fiscal Recovery Fund award will be used to support adjunct faculty necessary to provide adequate course availability to students at CSCU institutions.  Without these funds fiscal constraints would require these institutions to eliminate a large number of course sections across 16 institutions.  Given CSCU's CDC-compliant social distancing protocols which limit class size based on room, the students served by adjunct faculty in these courses would have difficulty finding alternatives within the system resulting in deferred completion, further decreased revenue for the system, and diminished student success.",,
"29693","Senior Food Vouchers","200000","2.1 - Household Assistance: Food Programs","The funds will be used to increase the value of the check booklets provided to seniors over the age of 60 and disabled individuals living in congregate housing where nutrition services are provided. Eligible program participants facing increased faced food insecurity due to the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will receive check booklets that were increased in value from $15 to $21 to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at participating Connecticut farmers' markets and farm stands.","Older adults who are less food secure are more likely to have adverse health consequence than food secure older adults. Chronic health conditions combined with food insecurity can negatively affect older adults’ ability to remain in the community. Due to a rise in food prices during Covid-19 and the resulting economic downturns, nutritious food is less accessible to income-restricted households. Research demonstrates the benefits of nutrition programs targeted specifically at seniors (Administration on Aging Research Brief Number 8, 2015; Lloyd JL and Wellman NS, “Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs” 2015). The expansion of existing benefits will provide stability and health benefits for Connecticut’s aging population.","The program is in early development stages and will provide performance metrics in future reports."

This year check booklets increased from $15 to $21 to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at participating Connecticut farmers' markets and farm stands.","The WIC program is one of the most well-documented, cost-effective programs that demonstrates real benefits to women and children. Researchers have found that: “Women who participate in WIC give birth to healthier babies who are more likely to survive infancy. WIC supports more nutritious diets and better infant feeding practices. WIC participants buy and eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, following the introduction of improved WIC food packages more closely aligned to current dietary guidance. Low-income children participating in WIC are just as likely to be immunized as more affluent children, and are more likely to receive preventive medical care than other low-income children.” (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, WIC Works, 2021). Given the rise in food prices during Covid-19 and the resulting economic downturns, nutritious food is less accessible to income-restricted households.","The program is in early development stages and will provide performance metrics in future reports."

This program enables organizations to achieve economies of scale through bulk purchase of food access to a more diverse selection of foods and the efficient delivery of those foods than can be achieved independently which assists low to moderate communities with improving accessibly to food to individuals and families that have felt the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Food banks and pantries are a primary long-term solution to addressing food insecurity and food-based pantry interventions have a strong-evidence basis for reducing food insecurity. Furthermore, the ""Double Up Food Bucks"" program is considered an evaluated, and pilot-tested intervention per the USDA.

Specifically, the elevator will allow for ADA compliance and client access to the second floor medical clinic operated by Cornell Scott Hill Health Center (CSHHC) from the first floor Drop-in Center. This center was opened in April 2021 in response to increased utilization of DESK's programs.

The purpose of the elevator is to facilitate access to the second floor medical facilities. The medical facilities will enable low-barrier onsite medical care for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness including COVID-19 testing and vaccination administration.

Increases in gun violence coupled with novel and more dangerous drugs is inextricably linked to the rise in violent crime in the state. The use of forensic science within crime laboratories plays a critical role in the criminal justice system. Studies have shown that forensic laboratory collaboration improves crime solvability and accuracy of verdicts. Forensic science can help identify a suspect (via DNA), link crime scenes (via DNA and firearms), identify dangerous drugs, and extract probative information from electronic media. Expeditious work by crime laboratories using state of the art analytical tools provides investigative leads during early stages of investigations, helps focus law enforcement efforts in the right direction, and ultimately results in improved case clearance. The agency’s forensic laboratory has an approach to greatly enhance its capabilities to support Connecticut’s criminal justice system by transporting forensic resources and analytical support to the crime scene and/or violent hot spots in order to quickly disrupt criminal activities.
