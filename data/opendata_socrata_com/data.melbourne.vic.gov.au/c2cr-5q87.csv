Adolescence is a critical developmental phase for achieving human potential. It is a time of life characterised by dynamic brain development, when interaction with the social environment moulds the capabilities that an individual takes forward into later life.
But are we creating the conditions for adolescents and young adults to thrive?

While elected to make legitimate decisions, politicians are increasingly seeking advice through the process of deliberative community engagement. In 2014, Melbourne City Council took the plunge and recruited a 'People's Panel' – a random selection of everyday people – a citizens' jury – to recommend council spending priorities for the next ten years. The results were surprising!
Can citizens' juries rebuild trust in representative democracies? Are they legitimate? What constitutes genuine engagement? How do you convince politicians to take the plunge into highly participatory community engagement? What’s it like to be a citizen jurist?

","A Sustainable Living Festival event supported by Melbourne Conversations ","At both the state and national levels, local leadership has failed to deliver even very small cuts in carbon emissions. Not surprisingly at the international level, the recent Copenhagen negotiations have produced no meaningful outcome either. We have to face it, conventional political change methods have not worked.  We have run out of time for half-measures. It is now imperative that a safe climate is restored as fast as humanly possible. This will require zero emissions, and more, at emergency speed. It seems that what is essential to accomplish is impossible to achieve. Clearly a breakthrough is needed. The Transition Decade campaign aims to guide effective action to achieve safe climate goals. The launch will present a strategy to harness the power of collaboration. An alliance of committed groups has been formed to drive a collaborative framework through a decade of structural and social change. The launch will create the opportunity to take the size and effectiveness of this alliance to a whole new level.
