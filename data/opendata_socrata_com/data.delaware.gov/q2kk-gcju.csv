A crash report is a summary of information collected about a collision and is filled out by a Delaware law enforcement officer who is investigating the crash.  The data contained on FirstMap and the Open Data Portal represents the best available information at DSHS and is not an official record of what transpired in a particular crash or for a particular crash type and does not contain personal information.  This data is generated from crash reports and allows any member of the public to engage in interactive analysis and data exploration for the purpose of identifying, evaluating or planning the safety enhancement of potential crash sites, hazardous roadway conditions, or railway-highway crossings.  This data is updated monthly and contains crashes that occurred since 2009 through six months ago.  Official crash reports are confidential and are not a public record under the Delaware Freedom of Information Act.  Authorized parties may contact the reporting police agency directly for official copies of crash reports (21 Del.

"vgb7-dzz9","2012 Land Use Land Cover","<DIV STYLE=""text-align:Left;""><DIV><DIV><P><SPAN>The 2012 Land Use Land Cover (LULC) update was performed using computer interactive heads-up digitizing techniques and ArcGIS software. The baseline datasets were year 2012 digital CIR orthophotos and the State’s existing 2007 LULC data. The data was digitally subdivided into working production modules based on the 1:24,000 scale USGS topographic quadrangle system. The LULC update was performed per the modified Anderson, et al., LULC classification and 2 acre minimum mapping unit (140’ width) established for the State’s previous LULC Update projects. The work was performed by Aerial Information Systems, Inc. (AIS) of Redlands, California.AIS staff analysts compared the State’s existing 2007 LULC data to the 2012 project imagery. Every polygon was reviewed for change, accuracy of polygon boundaries, and adherence to the 2012 LULC classification and mapping criteria. Polygon boundaries and codes were modified as necessary through the addition of new lines and codes or the modification of existing arcs. In addition, large obvious errors in the 2007 data were retroactively (‘retro”) corrected. The “retro” mapping process helps to ensure a more accurate baseline dataset for change analysis studies. The 2012 LULC interpretations were incorporated directly into the baseline 2007 LULC coverage to create a final composite coverage containing LULC information for both eras. Each polygon in the composite coverage was assigned an item for 2012 and 2007. Where no LULC change had occurred, the LULC class for both item years remained the same. Where a LULC change did occur, new boundaries were added to the data set as needed, subdividing the existing 2007 polygon, and the polygons were attributed for the appropriate 2012 LULC type. This method ensured that the different layers seamlessly co-registered to each other, creating a sliver free coverage for use in change analysis studies.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV>","dataset",,"https://data.delaware.gov/d/vgb7-dzz9","public","published","2021-08-23T13:42:52.000","2021-08-23T13:45:00.000","82","14"
