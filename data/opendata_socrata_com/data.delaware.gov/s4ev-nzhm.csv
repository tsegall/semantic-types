It was not called Smart Grid Technology at the time, but rather, Price Sensitive Load Management.

We use our passion of designing and making wooden signs to encourage everyone to put a personal touch in every gift; whether it be a birthday, mother's day, father's day, Christmas, or any important occasion. We also support the celebration of everyone's unique passions. Including sports, travel, pets and animals, people, humor, their careers and professions or alcohol. We understand life is all about relationships, and make it easy to tell your grandparents, sisters, parents, and best friends just how much they mean to you! With thousands of original designs, anyone is sure to find just the perfect sign for every occasion. We adore helping people use their individualistic taste to make their house a home! Most people feel drawn to wooden signs for their visual appeal. Which is understandable; they absolutely add undeniable charm to almost any residential or business setting. Our signs embrace our motto of Fun, Happy, Stuff! We offer a wide variety of welcome signs, farmhouse signs, kitchen signs, bathroom humor signs, and even nursery signs. We also have signs for businesses but just because you want your sign to serve a practical purpose doesn't mean it can't be aesthetically pleasing, too! All of our products are made from real quality wood using state of the art UV printers and wood shop equipment. To keep the importance of individualistic taste, we offer a variety of display options. We route slots for hanging, or add sawtooth hooks on the back, and even attach genuine hemp rope for a rustic feel. Many of our signs can sit freely on their own on a shelf, desk, tabletop, or mantel. Over the past year, JennyGems has made a significant transition from importing products from China to making our own products in our home state of Delaware. With the addition of many new employees, more than 50% of which are women, we strive to help empower other women to their highest potential. We have a vast array of tastes, opinions and creativity among our team to help us ensure there is something for everyone. Any new product idea can be graphically designed, and created all in the same day. We very carefully inspect every product for the highest possible quality. For every meaningful moment, JennyGems is there to help commemorate the occasion.","321999","452990","454110","453220","442299","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","POINT (-75.271287 38.727718)","Y"

We help providers, teams, and healthcare organizations move from the default self-focus of an inward mindset to the results-focus of an outward mindset. Through training, coaching, consulting, and our deep connection with and understanding of your health and healthcare challenges, we enable your organizations and people to achieve results that are only possible with an outward mindset, when they see the problem they don't see and become alive to the breadth of opportunities and options for achieving their goals, needs, and objectives. We help individuals, teams and organizations tackle three major challenges: Creating Collaborative Cultures Many healthcare organizations operate in a hierarchical, top-down culture that can hinder collaboration and foster conflict. The cross-functional collaboration and communication that are key to ensuring consistent clinical outcomes are undermined by the real or perceived differences in power, status, or influence that are a vestige of historical ways of operating in healthcare. We help providers, administrators and staff see their challenges differently to unleash their ability to better collaborate with and influence others. Improving Safety and Clinical Outcomes Many mistakes happen because individuals lack awareness of the impact of their actions on others within a healthcare system. With the health of patients at stake, and with increased bureaucratic scrutiny and oversight, improving safety and clinical outcomes is critically important. Our work helps overcome the many challenges in implementing process improvement, quality and safety initiatives wrought by hyper-attention to being procedurally correct while missing the opportunity to work as a team better. Research shows that low-functioning teams make far more errors and have worse outcomes than teams that work well together. Minimizing Risk and Increasing Patient Satisfaction Reigniting employee purpose and equipping healthcare professionals with the tools to effectively collaborate and communicate is key to minimizing risk and improving patient access, flow, and satisfaction. The mindset of healthcare professionals toward patients-what researchers have termed bedside manner and patient centricity -is a critical factor in the perceptions of patients regarding the care they receive. We help healthcare professionals find the outward mindset connection to their patients and customers that invigorates the quality. confidence. and closeness of those relationships.","541611","611430","621111","621112","621410","812990","813212","813920","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","POINT (-77.178526 39.072456)","Y"
