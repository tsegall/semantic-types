Because both contacts/friends know and trust the introducer, the introduction is valued and effective. HOW IT WORKSOnce the user downloads the app and completes her profile, the app is ready to go. The user selects two contacts/friends from the contacts in her phone. (The user can also type her contacts'/friends' names and cell numbers/emails directly into the app and save that contact information into her contacts.) The user chooses the introduction type: business, social, or romantic. The user sends both contacts/friends a quick message using the app's pre-loaded introductions or creates a customized message. Once the introducer hits the Send button, the introducer's two contacts/friends receive the same introductory message, plus each receives the other's contact information. The two can begin messaging immediately from the in-app messaging system or via email or text. The app enables the introducer to save customized messages and build a library of introductions.

(CED), recognized the need for a Fully Automated Demand Response/ Reduction System requiring NO Human Intervention, to help stabilize Power Grids in the USA and internationally, improving their reliability, while at the same time saving end users significant money on their energy bills. It was not called Smart Grid Technology at the time, but rather, Price Sensitive Load Management. Mr. Montalvo commenced R&D activities and on October 8, 2008, filed for a US Provisional Patent for such a system which he ultimately called FADRS (pronounced faders), this Fully Automated Demand Response and Reduction System was filed for patent review on October 8, 2009 and achieved full patent status in late 2012. FADRS is a highly advanced and robust group of integrated software programs that work in conjunctionwith sophisticated commercially available Building Automation Systems (BAS). FADRS is licensed to end users in modules depending on the client's needs. FADRS utilizes Self-Healing Artificial Intelligence and Network technology, so it behaves more like a highly advanced human controlling machines, to save significant money on energy, while at the same time minimizing human discomfort. Consolidated Energy Design is also involved in Design Build applications which include the following competencies; Advanced Energy Storage, HVAC Design and PM Services, Solar PV and Thermal Installs, Distributed Generation, Smart Micro Grid Technology, Deep Lighting and Plug Load Retrofits and a Developer of Net Zero Energy Buildings.","541690","541490","541420","237130","221118","221112","238210","334512","541350","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","28 Cedar Street

We use our passion of designing and making wooden signs to encourage everyone to put a personal touch in every gift; whether it be a birthday, mother's day, father's day, Christmas, or any important occasion. We also support the celebration of everyone's unique passions. Including sports, travel, pets and animals, people, humor, their careers and professions or alcohol. We understand life is all about relationships, and make it easy to tell your grandparents, sisters, parents, and best friends just how much they mean to you! With thousands of original designs, anyone is sure to find just the perfect sign for every occasion. We adore helping people use their individualistic taste to make their house a home! Most people feel drawn to wooden signs for their visual appeal. Which is understandable; they absolutely add undeniable charm to almost any residential or business setting. Our signs embrace our motto of Fun, Happy, Stuff! We offer a wide variety of welcome signs, farmhouse signs, kitchen signs, bathroom humor signs, and even nursery signs. We also have signs for businesses but just because you want your sign to serve a practical purpose doesn't mean it can't be aesthetically pleasing, too! All of our products are made from real quality wood using state of the art UV printers and wood shop equipment. To keep the importance of individualistic taste, we offer a variety of display options. We route slots for hanging, or add sawtooth hooks on the back, and even attach genuine hemp rope for a rustic feel. Many of our signs can sit freely on their own on a shelf, desk, tabletop, or mantel. Over the past year, JennyGems has made a significant transition from importing products from China to making our own products in our home state of Delaware. With the addition of many new employees, more than 50% of which are women, we strive to help empower other women to their highest potential. We have a vast array of tastes, opinions and creativity among our team to help us ensure there is something for everyone. Any new product idea can be graphically designed, and created all in the same day. We very carefully inspect every product for the highest possible quality. For every meaningful moment, JennyGems is there to help commemorate the occasion.","321999","452990","454110","453220","442299","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","26850 Lewes-Georgetown Highway

We help providers, teams, and healthcare organizations move from the default self-focus of an inward mindset to the results-focus of an outward mindset. Through training, coaching, consulting, and our deep connection with and understanding of your health and healthcare challenges, we enable your organizations and people to achieve results that are only possible with an outward mindset, when they see the problem they don't see and become alive to the breadth of opportunities and options for achieving their goals, needs, and objectives. We help individuals, teams and organizations tackle three major challenges: Creating Collaborative Cultures Many healthcare organizations operate in a hierarchical, top-down culture that can hinder collaboration and foster conflict. The cross-functional collaboration and communication that are key to ensuring consistent clinical outcomes are undermined by the real or perceived differences in power, status, or influence that are a vestige of historical ways of operating in healthcare. We help providers, administrators and staff see their challenges differently to unleash their ability to better collaborate with and influence others. Improving Safety and Clinical Outcomes Many mistakes happen because individuals lack awareness of the impact of their actions on others within a healthcare system. With the health of patients at stake, and with increased bureaucratic scrutiny and oversight, improving safety and clinical outcomes is critically important. Our work helps overcome the many challenges in implementing process improvement, quality and safety initiatives wrought by hyper-attention to being procedurally correct while missing the opportunity to work as a team better. Research shows that low-functioning teams make far more errors and have worse outcomes than teams that work well together. Minimizing Risk and Increasing Patient Satisfaction Reigniting employee purpose and equipping healthcare professionals with the tools to effectively collaborate and communicate is key to minimizing risk and improving patient access, flow, and satisfaction. The mindset of healthcare professionals toward patients-what researchers have termed bedside manner and patient centricity -is a critical factor in the perceptions of patients regarding the care they receive. We help healthcare professionals find the outward mindset connection to their patients and customers that invigorates the quality. confidence. and closeness of those relationships.","541611","611430","621111","621112","621410","812990","813212","813920","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","24 Old Creek Court

These methods and practices are aligned with Restorative Justice, which is a paradigm of conflict resolution that is noon-punitive and seeks to counteract the negative effects of the punitive criminal legal system. Restorative Justice�s effects on the statistics of recidivism, exclusionary discipline, and other punitive systems are incredibly positive. When utilized to support relationship and community building, negative behaviors are greatly reduced. Restorative practices are therefore preventative in nature. Next world commons seek to assist organizations in implementing restorative practices so that the likelihood of harm occurring is greatly reduced.KEYWORDS: Healthy Schools, Community Organizations, Institutions, Restorative Practice, School Programming.","711510","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","600 N.
