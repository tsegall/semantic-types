This layer includes Oakland’s Proposed Bikeway Network, streets proposed for bicycle improvements in Oakland's Bicycle Plan (last updated July 2019) as well as existing bikeways.

Bikeways are defined by ""class,"" each with specific characteristics (see Definition). The fields “Proposed Class” and “ExistingClass” show the proposed and current state of the network, based on these class definitions. For some existing bikeways, the proposed bikeway class is not the same as the existing class. 

Designations reflect existing and proposed bikeways as of June 30, 2020 This dataset was last updated July 28, 2020. Data is typically updated in January and July.

Class type (0, 1, 2, 2.0, 2.3A, 2B, 2B.0, 2B.3A, 2B.2, 3, 3.0, 3A, 3A.0, 3B, or 4, 4.2, 4.2B, 4.3A and 4.4.2B) appears in the ProposedClass (ProposedCl) and ExistingClass (ExistingCl) fields. 

If the Class doesn't include a decimal point, the bikeway is existing (or proposed) on both sides of a two-way street or on one side of a one-way street. A decimal point indicates that there is a different class on each side of a two-way street. 

Class 1 = bike paths, paved rights-of-way that are completely separated from the street, and typically shared with pedestrians.
Class 2 & variants = bike lanes, lanes striped on streets and designated specifically for bicyclists. 
•	Class 2 = bike lanes
•	Class 2.0 = bike lanes one side of the street, no facility one side of street
•	Class 2.3A = bike lanes one side of thre street, sharrows one side of street
•	Class 2B = buffered bike lanes
•	Class 2B.0 = buffered bike lanes one side of street, no facility one side of street
•	Class 2B.3A = buffered bike lanes one side of the street, sharrows one side of street
•	Class 2B.2 = buffered bike lanes one side of street, bike lanes one side of street

Inventory and occupancy data was collected for over 2,500 block faces in February of 2018 between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Block faces were selected for inclusion in the study if any portion of the block face was within 1,500 feet of International Boulevard between 1st Avenue and Durant Avenue. The total length of available parking on each block was collected for blocks with parallel parking, and a number of spaces was collected for those with angled or perpendicular parking. Spaces were further differentiated by metered, unmarked regular, commercial loading, passenger loading, and accessible spaces. Private access or otherwise reserved spaces were not included in the study. Data validation efforts included additional field visits to ground-truth the inventory data and ensure that the observed occupancies were typical, as well as comparisons of the inventory data to block face lengths to identify data entry errors. Certain block faces with identified data entry or collection errors were re-collected in subsequent field visits in March of 2018.","31",,,"published"

This layer includes Oakland’s Proposed Bikeway Network, streets proposed for bicycle improvements in Oakland's Bicycle Plan (last updated July 2019) as well as existing bikeways.

Bikeways are defined by ""class,"" each with specific characteristics (see Definition). The fields “Proposed Class” and “ExistingClass” show the proposed and current state of the network, based on these class definitions. For some existing bikeways, the proposed bikeway class is not the same as the existing class. 

Designations reflect existing and proposed bikeways as of June 30, 2020 This dataset was last updated July 28, 2020. Data is typically updated in January and July.

Class type (0, 1, 2, 2.0, 2.3A, 2B, 2B.0, 2B.3A, 2B.2, 3, 3.0, 3A, 3A.0, 3B, or 4, 4.2, 4.2B, 4.3A and 4.4.2B) appears in the ProposedClass (ProposedCl) and ExistingClass (ExistingCl) fields. 

If the Class doesn't include a decimal point, the bikeway is existing (or proposed) on both sides of a two-way street or on one side of a one-way street. A decimal point indicates that there is a different class on each side of a two-way street. 

Class 1 = bike paths, paved rights-of-way that are completely separated from the street, and typically shared with pedestrians.
Class 2 & variants = bike lanes, lanes striped on streets and designated specifically for bicyclists.

Salary steps are a proxy for teaching experience, as teachers move one step up the salary schedule for each year of teaching. In theory, teachers on salary steps 1-5 have between 1-5 years of teaching experience (not just in OUSD, but anywhere). However, it is important to note that salary steps are just a proxy and not always exactly equal to years of teaching experience.

Percents are then calculated at the school level by dividing the number of teachers on salary steps 1-5 by the total number of teachers at that school. Schools are placed into groups based on the racial and ethnic breakdown of their student population (see note below data table for full explanation of grouping). Average percent of teachers on salary steps 1-5 is then calculated for each group of schools.","38",,,"published"

The following criteria were used to determining the indicators included in each of the topics in the final framework:
1. Data is available, high quality, and from a reliable source.
2. We will be able to calculate change over time (i.e., data is updated and accessible on an
annual basis and changes from year to year can be meaningfully interpreted).
3. There is a strong causal model for why this Indicator matters (i.e., we understand the
context behind the Indicator and how disparities affect people).
4. The data accurately represents the impact of inequity on people’s lives (e.g., not
measuring quantity when what matters is quality).","17",,,"published"

The land areas are termed “old industrial” due to their presence prior to roughly 1970, the timeframe when PCB production in the U.S. ceased.

The digitization of Important Bird Areas represents an important first step in conservation planning of these critical habitats using GIS. As of October 2007, a draft layer of all 148 Important Bird Areas in California was completed.  Currently, a review is in progress with Audubon Chapters and local experts, with a final version completed by Nov. 1, 2008.
