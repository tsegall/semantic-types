The report included a description of the incident, cleanup actions taken, sample results and disposal documentation. On September 02, 2021, several tractor trailers caught fire in a parking lot located at 2000 West Marshall Drive, Grand Prairie (Dallas County), Texas 75051. As a result of the firefighting activities, water and diesel flowed towards three stormwater inlets, which connects with the Cottonwood Creek. Poly-Trucking contracted Sunbelt and Apex to perform response actions. When Sunbelt arrived at the area, the crew assessed the impact to the creek and placed a floating boom downstream of the impacted area; a second boom was placed 900 feet downstream of the first boom. Additional absorbent booms were placed at the stormwater outfall. Sunbelt crew captured the floating material using a pump and a floating skimmer, and the crew later washed the stormwater outfall and collected the water in a vacuum truck. Sunbelt also decontaminated the impacted parking lot area and excavated the contaminated soil adjacent to the creek and stormwater outlet. 

Apex collected several soil and water samples from different sections of the impacted area to determine the contamination levels in the creek and adjacent banks. The samples were sent to Eurofins Xenco lab (National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program Certification No. T104704295-21-28) in Dallas, Texas to be tested for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Additional water quality data (temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and oxidation reduction potential) were collected with handheld monitors. The confirmation samples were consistent with background conditions. 

The wastewater collected during the cleanup activities was disposed at Turkey Creek Landfill (Municipal Solid Waste Permit No. 1417C) in Alvarado, Texas, and Valicor Environmental Services Hutchins (Solid Waste Registration No. 95791) in Hutchins, Texas. The impacted soil, booms, and pads waste generated during the cleanup activities was disposed at Turkey Creek Landfill in Alvarado, Texas.

The incident was discovered on January 19, 2022, around 1930 hours local time. The cause is a tractor trailer tanker (transporter) erroneously unloading into the wrong storage tank. The transporter was delivering approximately 4,500 gallons of Aquamine® (liquid ammonium sulfate) to an empty labeled storage tank. After being instructed by the Plant Operator on duty to what port to hookup, the transporter misunderstood the instructions. While the operator went to open the fill valve and notify the transporter that the valve had been opened, the transporter opened the tanker pressurized valve and started to unload chemical into the wrong storage tank. Immediately, the liquid ammonium sulfate in the tank and the sodium hypochlorite solution reacted, causing the storage tank to burst and chemical to be spilled into the containment. The containment was compromised causing sodium hypochlorite to spill into a stormwater drain that led to a ravine and into the Rio Grande River. The water plant was not disrupted and was able to continue production. No human and non-human injuries were reported.

Emergency hazmat companies Clean Harbors from San Antonio, Chemical Response Remediation Contractors (CRRC) from Harlingen (subcontracted by Clean Harbors), and Broadbent from San Antonio (subcontracted by CRRC) were obtained for remediation and cleanup. Clean Harbors and CRRC responded around 0800 hours in the morning securing the spilled material and awaiting an NRC incident number to continue remediation. Broadbent's estimated time of arrival to collect samples at the ravine is the morning of January 21, 2022.

The responsible parties (RP) are the City of Roma and Linden Bulk Transportation, LLC. The RP has contained the released material and is awaiting the hazmat companies to complete remediation and soil analysis. The RP has been advised to remove, properly dispose of the generated waste, and remediate the soil to background conditions. The RP has been advised to submit a response action plan within 30 days of the discovery of the release. Also, to submit cleanup photos, disposal documents, and soil analysis results once the cleanup response has been completed to demonstrate compliance with Title 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) §327.5 - Spill Prevention and Control requirements.","1795697","REGION 15 - HARLINGEN",

On August 1, 2016, Ms. Kara Allen, Environmental Investigator (EI) with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Region 13 – San Antonio Office, conducted an Emergency Response Record Review (ER RR) to determine compliance with 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 327 rules and requirements for an incident (Incident No. 234164) which occurred on May 30, 2016. The incident occurred on County Road (CR) 182 near Highway (Hwy) 72 in Kenedy, Karnes County, Texas. The incident, which involved an 18-wheeler rollover, resulted in the release of approximately 90 to 100 barrels of saltwater to the right-of-way and onto private property near the accident location.

BACKGROUND

On May 30, 2016, TCEQ San Antonio Office received notification of the spill at 12:16 p.m. The incident was reported as a salt water spill from an 18-wheeler rollover on CR 182. The incident was originally reported by Mr. Shelby Dupnik, Karnes County Emergency Management Coordinator. Ms. Allen, Primary Emergency Response Contact, called Mr. Dupnik to further discuss the incident. Mr. Dupnik stated that the tanker truck was half-full to full, and may have spilled more on private property than any other land. At that time, Mr. Dupnik had left a message with the Railroad  Commission of Texas (RRC) hotline and was awaiting a call back.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., Emergency Response Coordinator Ms. Joy Thurston-Cook contacted Mr. Chris Dzuik, TCEQ Region 13 EI, concerning the incident. Mr. Dzuik contacted Mr. Dupnik later that day regarding the specific location and details of the spill. Mr. Dupnik indicated that the accident resulted in the release of salt water to the right-of-way and onto private property near the accident location. Mr. Dzuik then contacted TCEQ San Antonio Office Waste Section Manager Mr. Cameron Lopez regarding the incident. It was determined at this time that Mr. Dzuik should depart to the location to assess any potential environmental concerns.

Mr. Dzuik arrived at the location at 1:30 p.m. and spoke with Mr. Dupnik who was still present at the scene. Mr. Dupnik informed Mr. Dzuik that there was a fatality associated to the accident and that Texas Department of Public Safety officers were evaluating the scene. Upon arrival at the scene, Mr. Dzuik was informed that the Responsible Party (RP) was Select Energy Services based in Kenedy, Texas. Representatives of the RP. Mr. Brandon Ziegel and Mr. Craig Fric, were at the scene to assess any environmental concerns. Mr. Fric indicated that CTI Environmental had been contracted to perform any necessary cleanup activities at the scene. Select Energy Services Representatives utilized another transport tanker, which had also arrived at the spill location, to transfer any remaining saltwater from the overturned tanker. Based on the information provided to Mr. Dzuik, approximately 90 to 100 barrels of saltwater were discharged. Mr. Dzuik provided contact information for the RRC to the RP so that the appropriate regulatory agencies were notified regarding the discharge. The RP contacted the RRC after hours contact line while Mr. Dzuik was present at the scene. RRC representatives indicated that a site visit would be performed the following day. Mr. Dzuik spoke with Mr. Alvin Theis, CTI Environmental representative, before departing the scene. Mr. Dzuik was informed that CTI Environmental would be handling the reporting requirements for the RP. Mr. Dzuik departed the scene shortly thereafter. Mr. Dzuik informed Mr. Theis that a representative from the TCEQ would be in contact regarding to whom any cleanup reports should be sent.","A 18 wheeler tanker truck rolled over and a large amount of saltwater leaked out.",,"REGION 13 - SAN ANTONIO",

The investigator met with Mr. Eric Lowry and Ms. Caitlin Roberson, Deputy Smith County Fire Marshals.  Mr. Lowry explained that they were still investigating the fire at the facility. The investigator observed that the fire was contained to the storage shed on the south side of the property.  During the investigation, the investigator was accompanied by Mr. Jack Holsomback, TCEQ Small Business & Local Government Program.

Several Smith County fire departments reportedly responded to the fire at this location.  Class A foam and water were used to minimize the amount of water used to extinguish the fire.  Based on observations onsite, the fire water appears to have been contained onsite. This site is located directly across the street from Lake Palestine, Neches River Basin (Segment 0605).  The small shed was totally destroyed by the fire, along with it’s contents.  

As a part of the investigation, the investigator also conducted an evaluation of their current scrap tire management practices.  At the rear of the property, there was a large pile of scrap tires, left over from the former operator of the business, Mr. Eddie Martinez.  The scrap tire pile was measured and the investigator calculated it contained 2,000 Passenger Tire Equivalents (PTEs).  

 According to Mr. Lowry, Mr. Martinez has relinquished his business to a new operator, Mr. Travis Coslett.   The transfer of ownership of the business was reportedly going to occur on December 15, 2017.

The investigator and Mr. Holsomback met briefly with Mr. Coslett before leaving the site.  Mr. Coslett stated he was operating the business in the interim since Mr. Martinez left.  The property owner, Mr. John Appel had previously contacted the investigator about the scrap tire pile.  In an email, he indicated he was making arrangement to have a semi-trailer brought in by Benton Rainey Tire & Recovery, a registered scrap tire transporter and processor.  Previously, Mr. Appel had a trailer load of scrap tires removed.  The investigator attempted to contact Mr. Martinez on December 7, 2017, but phone number no longer works.


CONCLUSION

There did not appear to be any significant impact from the firewater discharges from this fire, as it did not appear to have left the site.  Therefore, this incident should be closed with no further action needed. This emergency incident is being closed.  At this time, the Tyler Region is still working with Mr. Appel on the removal of the scrap tires.","On December 6, 2017, the TCEQ Tyler Office was notified of a fire at Martinez New & Used Tire (MN&UT).

Upon arrival, the investigators observed the saltwater spill impacting a third party property located south of the salt water disposal facility. The release was caused by a third party contractor conducting land clearing operations, which resulted in the accidental excavation of a 3 inch and 4 inch line from the disposal facility. As a result, the lines burst and released an unknown amount of saltwater onto a third party property to the west of the saltwater disposal facility (See attachment 1). No odors were noted. No sheen was observed. Using the MultiRAE, no readings were noted. The owner of the salt water disposal facility, Mr. Marcos Espinoza, arrived on site at approximately 1900 hours. Mr. Espinoza stated that the well, which is part of the facility's impacted lines, had been out of service for approximately one year. 

At approximately 1930 hours, the investigators proceeded to an additional residential property that was affected by the spilled material to the west of the spill area. A significant amount of saltwater was also observed to have impacted the property (See attachment 2). The investigators explained to the affected property owner that the spill will need to be remediated by the responsible party and that this incident is under the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). The investigators departed the scene and returned to the regional office. 

The same day, Ms. Serna contacted Ms. Brooklyn Clement, Assistant Director with the RRC Corpus Christi office, to notify of the ER incident. Ms. Clement stated that a RRC Investigator would be assigned to the case and would be deployed to assess the incident. Details of the incident and information gathered during the immediate on site response was provided to Ms. Clement.","On May 18, 2019, at approximately 1800 hours, a notification via phone call from Mr. Jose Alejandro, District Coordinator with the Texas Division of Emergency Management, was received by Mr. Jose Salinas, Environmental Investigator with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Laredo Region Office (LRO).
