Now the restored Earth is ready for inhabitants, and the Oankali want Lilith to help awaken the rest of the survivors and rebuild humankind. But the Oankali have needs of their ownÉ and salvation comes at a price.

"88726","Tattoos & Tribes","For millennia tattooing has served as a unique art form with many intimate and social purposes across the world. But why do we tattoo, scar, or ink our skin? In this workshop series we will engage global tattoo traditions and histories spanning from ancient civilizations to present day meanings of tribal tattooing, and more.  From tattoo folk art influences in the contemporary art world to cultural significances and stereotypes about prison and gang culture tattoos, we will explore our preconceptions about tattoo art and use these comparisons to talk about our own identities, body image, and colonial legacies leading to modern day misconceptions about race.  Throughout this monthly workshop series we will delve into tattoo techniques, styles, and symbols as we craft, sketch, and draw our own tattoo designs.

"105896","Feminist Book Club: Bad Feminist","Join Independence Branch for an online discussion of feminist fiction and non-fiction!Our second title to be discussed will be Roxane Gay's Bad Feminist.&nbsp;&nbsp;""This trenchant collection assembles previously published essays and new work by cultural critic and novelist Gay (An Untamed State). Even though she loves pink, feels nostalgic about the Sweet Valley High series, and lets degrading rap lyrics blast from her car stereo, Gay is passionately committed to feminist issues, such as equal opportunity and pay and reproductive freedom. Writing about race, politics, gender, feminism, privilege, and popular media, she highlights how deeply misogyny is embedded in our culture, the careless language used to discuss sexual violence (seen in news reports of sexual assault), Hollywood's tokenistic treatment of race, the trivialization of literature written by women, and the many ways American society fails women and African-Americans. Gay bemoans that fact that role models like Bill Cosby and Don Lemon urge African-Americans to act like ideal citizens while glossing over institutional problems in the education, social welfare, and justice system that exacerbate racism and poverty. Although Gay is aware of her privilege as a middle-class Haitian-American, she doesn't refrain from advising inner-city students to have higher expectations. Whatever her topic, Gay's provocative essays stand out for their bravery, wit, and emotional honesty."" ---Publisher's WeeklyHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"114730","Non-Fiction Book Discussion: The Address Book","All are welcome to join a discussion of The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal About Identity, Race, Wealth, and Power.&nbsp;""When most people think about street addresses, if they think of them at all, it is in their capacity to ensure that the postman can deliver mail, or a traveler wonÕt get lost. But street addresses were not invented to help you find your way; they were created to find you. In many parts of the world, your address can reveal your race and class.In this wide-ranging and remarkable book, Deirdre Mask looks at the fate of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr., the wayfinding means of ancient Romans, and how Nazis haunt the streets of modern Germany. The flipside of having an address is not having one, and we also see what that means for millions of people today, including those who live in the slums of Kolkata and on the streets of London. Filled with fascinating people and histories, The Address Book illuminates the complex and sometimes hidden stories behind street names and their power to name, to hide, to decide who counts, who doesnÕtÑand why."" - from the publisher, St. Martin's PressHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"121588","Adult Book Discussion: On Juneteenth by Annette Gordon-Reed","Join Legler Regional as we discuss On Juneteenth by Annette Gordon-Reed.Weaving together American history, dramatic family chronicle, and searing episodes of memoir, Annette Gordon-ReedÕs On Juneteenth provides a historianÕs view of the countryÕs long road to Juneteenth, recounting both its origins in Texas and the enormous hardships that African-Americans have endured in the century since, from Reconstruction through Jim Crow and beyond. All too aware of the stories of cowboys, ranchers, and oilmen that have long dominated the lore of the Lone Star State, Gordon-Reed_herself a Texas native and the descendant of enslaved people brought to Texas as early as the 1820s_forges a new and profoundly truthful narrative of her home state, with implications for us all.How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"94640","Tattoos & Tribes","For millennia tattooing has served as a unique art form with many intimate and social purposes across the world. But why do we tattoo, scar, or ink our skin? In this workshop series we will engage global tattoo traditions and histories spanning from ancient civilizations to present day meanings of tribal tattooing, and more.  From tattoo folk art influences in the contemporary art world to cultural significances and stereotypes about prison and gang culture tattoos, we will explore our preconceptions about tattoo art and use these comparisons to talk about our own identities, body image, and colonial legacies leading to modern day misconceptions about race.  Throughout this monthly workshop series we will delve into tattoo techniques, styles, and symbols as we craft, sketch, and draw our own tattoo designs. This is the first program for Tattoos & Tribes, a virtual series by Jose Luis Benavides, YOUmedia teen associate at Back of the Yards Branch. How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

During this program, Alex Yoffe will provide an explanation of the parts of the gamelan orchestra, a unique and delightful group of instruments typically played in Indonesia.  Alex will also show recordings demonstrating the cultural contexts in which the gamelan is heard in Indonesia.  The program will conclude with a presentation of a shorter-length traditional piece demonstrating how the instruments work together and question period.This promises to be a wonderful, not-to-be-missed experience!  The program will not be recorded, It is a one-time event.Friends of the Gamelan, affectionately know as FROG, traces its roots to the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, held in Chicago.  One of the many exotic attractions on the Midway Plaisance was the Java Village, complete with a Sundanese gamelan.  Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History was founded to preserve, catalog, and exhibit the many cultural treasures from the Exposition, including the gamelan. In the late 1970s, a group began to meet regularly at the Field Museum to play on those very instruments. FROG formed in 1980 as a not-for-profit educational organization with the purpose of purchasing a Javanese gamelan for pedagogy and performance, to continue the work begun at the Field Museum.Ki Midiyanto, a highly respected gamelan musician and puppeteer (dhalang), assisted FROG in commissioning its bronze gamelan set, Gamelan Sri Sedana, from a gamelan maker in Java.  It arrived in Chicago in 2000.  FROG has been privileged to work with many outstanding Javanese gamelan musicians, including Midiyanto, Sumarsam, Harjito, Wakidi Dwidjomartono, Raharja, Ki Purbo Asmara, Joko Sustrino, and, most recently, Heri Purwanto. FROG also enjoys a close relationship with the Indonesian Consulate-Chicago, which often provides dancers for our performances. FROG has performed at many notable venues, including Pritzker Pavilion at Millennium Park, Chicago World Music Festival at Preston Bradley Hall, and the Field Museum.This program is a joint presentation of the Asian American/Pacific Islander Cultural Committee and the Social Sciences and History Department of the Chicago Public Library.How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.  Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the Star. Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing black woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.  --PublisherHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"114099","Adult Book Discussion: Anxious People","Join the Budlong Woods Branch for&nbsp;a discussion of&nbsp;Anxious People&nbsp;by Fredrik Backman.&nbsp;""Looking at real estate isn't usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix their own marriage. There's a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world. Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them--the bank robber included--desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.""  --PublisherHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"113547","Masterpiece Book Club: The Chaperone","Join the Budlong Woods Branch for&nbsp;a discussion of&nbsp;The Chaperone&nbsp;by Laura Moriarty. This novel is the basis for the PBS Masterpiece film production directed by Michael Engler and starring Elizabeth McGovern and Haley Lu Richardson.Only a few years before becoming a famous silent-film star and an icon of her generation, a fifteen-year-old Louise Brooks leaves Wichita, Kansas, to study with the prestigious Denishawn School of Dancing in New York. Much to her annoyance, she is accompanied by a thirty-six-year-old chaperone, who is neither mother nor friend. Cora Carlisle, a complicated but traditional woman with her own reasons for making the trip, has no idea what she's in for. Young Louise, already stunningly beautiful and sporting her famous black bob with blunt bangs, is known for her arrogance and her lack of respect for convention. Ultimately, the five weeks they spend together will transform their lives forever.  Drawing on the rich history of the 1920s, '30s, and beyond--from the orphan trains to Prohibition, flappers, and the onset of the Great Depression to the burgeoning movement for equal rights and new opportunities for women--Laura Moriarty's The Chaperone illustrates how rapidly everything, from fashion and hemlines to values and attitudes, was changing at this time and what a vast difference it all made for Louise Brooks, Cora Carlisle, and others like them.&nbsp; --PublisherHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"113969","Non-Fiction Book Discussion - Mad Enchantment: Claude Monet and the Painting of the Water Lilies by Ross King","""Claude Monet is perhaps the world's most beloved artist, and among all his creations, the paintings of the water lilies in his garden at Giverny are most famous. Monet intended the water lilies to provide 'an asylum of peaceful meditation.' Yet, as Ross King reveals in his magisterial chronicle of both artist and masterpiece, these beautiful canvases (featured in black and white images throughout, as well as a 16-pg color insert) belie the intense frustration Monet experienced in trying to capture the fugitive effects of light, water, and color. They also reflect the terrible personal torments Monet suffered in the last dozen years of his life.Mad Enchantment&nbsp;tells the full story behind the creation of the Water Lilies, as the horrors of World War I came ever closer to Paris and Giverny and a new generation of younger artists, led by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, were challenging the achievements of Impressionism. By early 1914, French newspapers were reporting that Monet, by then seventy-three, had retired his brushes. He had lost his beloved wife, Alice, and his eldest son, Jean. His famously acute vision--what Paul Cezanne called 'the most prodigious eye in the history of painting' --was threatened by cataracts. And yet, despite ill health, self-doubt, and advancing age, Monet began painting again on a more ambitious scale than ever before.Linking great artistic achievement to the personal and historical dramas unfolding around it, Ross King presents the most intimate and revealing portrait of an iconic figure in world culture."" - from Bloomsbury PublishingHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

When a classmate goes missing, Jai decides to use the crime-solving skills he has picked up from TV to find him. He asks Pari and Faiz to be his assistants and together they draw up lists of people to interview and places to visit. But what begins as a game turns sinister as other children start disappearing from their neighborhood. Jai, Pari, and Faiz have to confront terrified parents, an indifferent police force, and their fears of soul-snatching djinns. As the disappearances edge ever closer to home, the lives of Jai and his friends will never be the same again"" --From the PublisherHow to Attend:This event takes place on Zoom.

"127719","Adult Book Club: The Holdout","Join the Merlo Branch Adult Book Club for a discussion of&nbsp;The Holdout&nbsp;by Graham Moore.""It's the most sensational case of the decade. Fifteen-year-old Jessica Silver, heiress to a billion-dollar real estate fortune, vanishes on her way home from school. Her teacher Bobby Nock, a twenty-five-year-old African American man, is the prime suspect after illicit text messages are discovered between them--and Jessica's blood is found in his car. The subsequent trial taps straight into America's most pressing preoccupations: race, class, sex, law enforcement, and the lurid sins of the rich and famous. It's an open and shut case for the prosecution, and a quick conviction seems all but guaranteed. Until Maya Seale, a young woman on the jury, convinced of Nock's innocence, persuades the rest of the jurors to return the verdict of not guilty, a controversial decision that will change all of their lives forever. Flash forward ten years. A true-crime docuseries reassembles the jurors, with particular focus on Maya, now a defense attorney herself. When one of the jurors is found dead in Maya's hotel room, all evidence points to her as the killer. Now, she must prove her own innocence--by getting to the bottom of a case that is far from closed. As the present-day murder investigation weaves together with the story of what really happened during their deliberation, told by each of the jurors in turn, the secrets they have all been keeping threaten to come out--with drastic consequences for all involved""--How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"106681","Adult Book Discussion: Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel","Join a discussion of Wolf Hall, a Man Booker Prize winner by&nbsp;Hilary Mantel.""England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of 20 years and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe oppose him. Into this impasse steps Thomas Crowell: a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?""--Publisher""Startlingly enjoyable...a great read from a great mind.""&nbsp; --Star Tribune, MinneapolisHow to AttendThis book discussion will be on Zoom.

"106840","Adult Book Discussion: Beneath a Scarlet Sky","Join Albany Park Branch's book club as we discuss&nbsp;Beneath A Scarlet Sky&nbsp;by Mark T. Sullivan.&nbsp;&nbsp;""Edgar-finalist Sullivan (Triple Cross) lays on history with a trowel in this overstuffed tale of derring-do set in Italy during WWII. In 1943, 17-year-old Pino Lella's parents send him to the mountains to escape the bombardment of Milan. When he returns home on the eve of his 18th birthday, his parents urge him to join the German army to avoid the draft and thus be spared a one-way ticket to the Russian front. As the months go by, Pino turns up, Zelig-like, to witness every significant element of wartime life. He leads Jewish refugees across the dangerously snowy alps to the Swiss border, confronts local bandits masquerading as members of the anti-Fascist resistance, watches as people are loaded into boxcars destined for Auschwitz, overhears what could be the talk of the German generals' plot to overthrow Hitler, finds girls and wine for American army officers, and so on. Facing a few obstacles he can't overcome, the heroic Pino easily outfoxes the Nazis. Agent: Meg Ruley, Jane Rotrosen Agency. (May) © Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

"105514","Astronomy: The Dark Energy Survey","Rick Kessler, Research Professor at Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) at the University of Chicago, will discuss the motivation for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the survey instrument and 6-years of data taking (2013-2018), and some of its results.The Dark Energy Survey is an international, collaborative effort to map hundreds of millions of galaxies, detect thousands of supernovae, and find patterns of cosmic structure that will reveal the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is accelerating the expansion of our Universe. DES began searching the Southern skies on August 31, 2013.According to EinsteinÕs theory of General Relativity, gravity should lead to a slowing of the cosmic expansion. Yet, in 1998, two teams of astronomers studying distant supernovae made the remarkable discovery that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. To explain cosmic acceleration, cosmologists are faced with two possibilities: either 70% of the universe exists in an exotic form, now called dark energy, that exhibits a gravitational force opposite to the attractive gravity of ordinary matter, or General Relativity must be replaced by a new theory of gravity on cosmic scales.DES is designed to probe the origin of the accelerating universe and help uncover the nature of dark energy by measuring the 14-billion-year history of cosmic expansion with high precision. More than 400 scientists from over 25 institutions in the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, and Australia are working on the project. The collaboration built is using an extremely sensitive 570-Megapixel digital camera, DECam, mounted on the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, high in the Chilean Andes, to carry out the project.Over six years (2013-2019), the DES collaboration used 758 nights of observation to carry out a deep, wide-area survey to record information from 300 million galaxies that are billions of light-years from Earth. The survey imaged 5000 square degrees of the southern sky in five optical filters to obtain detailed information about each galaxy. A fraction of the survey time is used to observe smaller patches of sky roughly once a week to discover and study thousands of supernovae and other astrophysical transients.The talk will last approximately 45 minutes Ð 1 hour.Registration via email is required.

She will be reading selections and answering questions about her debut book Freedom! The Story of the Black Panther Party. Photo provided by: Levine QueridoThere is a saying: knowledge is power. The secret is this. Knowledge, applied at the right time and place, is more than power. ItÕs magic. ThatÕs what the Black Panther Party did. They called up this magic and launched a revolution. In the beginning, it was a story like any other. It could have been yours and itcould have been mine. But once it got going, it became more than any one person could have imagined.This is the story of Huey and Bobby. Eldridge and Kathleen. Elaine and Fred and Ericka. The committed partymembers. Their supporters and allies. The Free Breakfast Program and the Ten Point Program. ItÕs about Blacknationalism, Black radicalism, about Black people in America.Jetta Grace Martin is a debut author from the San Francisco Bay Area, and co-author of Freedom! The Story of the Black Panther Party, with Waldo E. Martin Jr. and Joshua Bloom. She earned her A.B. in Social Studies and African American Studies from Harvard University.

"135141","Voices for Justice: Author Julissa Arce","Chicago Public Library is pleased to welcome Julissa Arce author of You Sound Like A White Girl: The Case for Rejecting Assimilation as part of our Voices for Justice series and in celebration of Latinx Heritage Month. Julissa Arce is a writer, activist, and social changemaker. She is the nationally best-selling author of My (Underground) American Dream and Someone Like Me. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, TIME Magazine, CNN, CNBC, Vogue and other outlets. Her newest book, You Sound Like a White Girl: The Case for Rejecting Assimilation, is a powerful dual polemic and manifesto against the myth that assimilation leads to happiness and belonging for immigrants in America. Instead, she calls for a celebration of our uniqueness, our origins, our heritage, and the beauty of the differences that actually make us Americans. Prior to becoming an author and immigrant rights activist, Julissa built a successful career on Wall Street working for Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, and had seemingly achieved the American DreamÑyet she was not part of what legally defined an American.Julissa immigrated to America from Mexico at the age of 11 and was undocumented for almost 15 years, some of them spent rising to prominence on Wall Street. In order to help other young people in similar circumstances, she co-founded the Ascend Educational Fund (AEF). AEF is a college scholarship and mentorship program for immigrant students in New York City, regardless of their ethnicity, national origin or immigration status.   Julissa was named one of People en EspaolÕs 25 Most Powerful Women of 2017 and 2022, and 2018Õs Woman of the Year by the City of Los Angeles. She is a leading voice in the fight for social justice, immigrant rights and education equality.Julissa serves on the board of directors of the National Immigration Law Center. She was officially sworn in as an American citizen in August of 2014 and currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband and their two cats, Nikko and Pancho. She will be in conversation with Kelly Garcia. Kelly Garcia is a bilingual staff writer for the Chicago Reader, the city's bi-weekly alternative newspaper, where she writes about politics, police, and intra community issues on the Southwest Side. She was previously a summer reporting resident for Injustice Watch and a Civic Reporting Fellow for City Bureau. She also has bylines at a variety of Chicago-based outlets including The TRiiBE, South Side Weekly, and The Daily Line. She's from the sunny state of Florida, but has roots in Peru.This program is made possible thanks to generous support from the Chicago Public Library Foundation. For more information on the Foundation, visit cplfoundation.org.The book can also be purchased online from Latinx owned bookstores and other outlets.

Books and discussion topics will range from practical and immediate advice to big-picture issues in raising little ones. Celebrate the small wins and find support for the struggles among parents and caregivers in the community.  Books will be available for participants at the Humboldt Park Branch circulation desk for one month prior to our meeting date.For August, we will discuss Cribsheet: a Data-driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, From Birth to Preschool by Emily Oster.  This title is available in paperback, ebook, and downloadable audiobook formats.  From the publisher: ""From the author of Expecting Better... With Expecting Better, award-winning economist Emily Oster spotted a need in the pregnancy market for advice that gave women the information they needed to make the best decision for their own pregnancies. By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In Cribsheet, she now tackles an even great challenge: decision making in the early years of parenting. As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There's a rule--or three--for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the tradeoffs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision? Armed with the data, Oster finds that the conventional wisdom doesn't always hold up. She debunks myths around breastfeeding (not a panacea), sleep training (not so bad!), potty training (wait until they're ready or possibly bribe with M&Ms), language acquisition (early talkers aren't necessarily geniuses), and many other topics. She also shows parents how to think through freighted questions like if and how to go back to work, how to think about toddler discipline, and how to have a relationship and parent at the same time. Economics is the science of decision-making, and CRIBSHEET is a thinking parent's guide to the chaos and frequent misinformation of the early years. Emily Oster is a trained expert--and mom of two--who can empower us to make better, less fraught decisions--and stay sane in the years before preschool.""This book club will meet the first Saturday morning each month.How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

This title is available in paperback and ebook formats. From the publisher: ""The most effective parenting strategies often donÕt come from gurus but from real parents getting creative in moments of desperation. One mother threatens to sing in public anytime her daughters argue; another allows her daughter to play with tampons to get a few minutes on the toilet alone. For parents and caregivers with kids of all ages, the unconventional ÒwinsÓ in this book have helped children to diversify their appetites, stop sibling rivalry, cultivate independence, develop manners, and open upÑas well as parents themselves to find imaginative ways of salvaging time, money, intimacy, and their sanity.""This book club will meet the first Saturday morning each month.How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

"134733","Adult Book Discussion: Bad Blood","Join the Clearing Branch for a discussion of Bad Blood by John Carreyrou. Copies of the book are available at the front circulation desk.In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the next Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup ÒunicornÓ promised to revolutionize the medical industry with its breakthrough device, which performed the whole range of laboratory tests from a single drop of blood. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at more than $9 billion, putting HolmesÕs worth at an estimated $4.5 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didnÕt work. Erroneous results put patients in danger, leading to misdiagnoses and unnecessary treatments. All the while, Holmes and her partner, Sunny Balwani, worked to silence anyone who voiced misgivingsÑfrom journalists to their own employees.How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

"94212","Life as a QuaranTEEN: Youth Mental Health Post-Pandemic","<p>On top of the usual struggles of adolescence, young people have spent the last year adjusting to remote learning, disruptions to social lives, minor disappointments, and major losses. While we look towards the light of a post pandemic world, a whole new set of mental health concerns are emerging. How do we even think about approaching these challenges?</p><p><em>New York Times</em> columnist and American Psychological Association thought leader <strong>Lisa Damour, Ph.D.</strong> brings inspiring, practical advice about obstacles and opportunities for our mental health post-pandemic and skills we can use to foster a resilient rebound. In a youth-centered, youth-moderated conversation, Dr. Damour will outline strategies young people, and those who care for them, can use to support their mental health.</p><p>Dr. Damour is the author of two <em>New York Times</em> bestselling books,<em> Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood</em> and <em>Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls</em>.</p><p>She writes the monthly <em>Adolescence</em> column for the <em>New York Times</em>, co-hosts the <em>Ask Lisa</em> podcast, appears as a regular contributor to CBS News, works in collaboration with UNICEF, and serves on the Advisory Board for <em>Parents</em> magazine.</p><p>Dr. Damour will be in conversation with <strong>Saul Arnow</strong> and <strong>Margo Cicero</strong>, chair and vice-chair, respectively on the Mental Health Working Group of the city of Chicago’s <strong>Mayor’s Youth Commission</strong>. Mr Arnow is a junior at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, and Ms. Cicero is a junior at Whitney Young Magnet High School, both in Chicago.</p><p>The Mayor’s Youth Commission is made up of 25 high school and college students who were nominated by Chicago-based community organizations and represent neighborhoods and schools across the city. The inaugural class of Youth Commissioners was charged with developing a vision and youth-focused agenda for the Mayor’s administration and will now be a key voice in the city’s post-COVID recovery efforts.</p><p>This event suitable for all ages. It will be recorded and available later on our website and YouTube channel.</p><p><a href=""https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/9016196989076/WN_dcsP5sVDRwCeHaPz6nhGdQ""><strong>CLICK HERE TO REGISTER</strong></a></p>","My CHI.
