Subject: RE: Paramount Dr 
 
[EXTERNAL EMAIL]
Charles, 
 
The Paramount Dr property we spoke about two years ago, the street is a continual dump zone for someone who dumps asphalt millings there. In the 2 years since we have put the fence up and cleaned the area, they have dumped probably a foot or more of millings across Paramount drive and have now started dumping on my property again. And I suggest a foot or more as that is the amount we have to dig out to get our gates to close nowï¿½ 
 
Is there anything the county can do to police the dumping on the street?

Subject: Illegal Dumping

Hello Keith, 

I hope you had a great 4th of July!  

Attached are some photos of a vehicle (MD tag 6E 19166) which illegally dumped trash on our property on 7/4/2022 at 11:44am and at 11:47am a second time.

Please fine them as I caught them starting to unload at one dumpster (in front of 8203 Whispering Oaks Way -they came from the direction of Flower Hill Way), then after I got them to remove the trash, they drove over an illegally parked in a Reserved parking space for about 2 minutes, then drove around to the farther trash bin at the intersection of the unnamed road off of Whispering Oaks and Streamside Drive and dumped their trash after I told them previously a $500 fine and that it was illegal.  They intentionally did this act knowing it was against the law and a fine would be imposed.

I am willing to testify or provide any other information you need. 

Thank you,

Tricia Kennedy

Subject: MPIA Request / Removal of old broken Solar Panels stacked on side of home - possible toxic situation. 
[EXTERNAL EMAIL]
My neighbor located at 11035 Grassy Knoll Ter in Germantown MD 20876 has decided it was a good idea to place old used broken Solar Panels  
 
On the side of his home that are exposed uncovered and possibly leaking toxic by products into the ground in between our homes. 
 
These panels have been there for over a year and honestly I am getting tired of looking at them but after some research I am really worried 
 
They could be toxic. I am new to this neighborhood of only 5 years and they are an older couple that do not respond to waves, helloï¿½s or other 
 
Attempts to address this. I am sure they are aware of the Rockville Transfer Station for recycling but decided the side of their home, in my view 
 
Is a good place to stack up old possibly toxic solar panels. I am not sure who to contact regarding this but it does concern me and I would like them
 
Removed if possible. I have CCï¿½d the HOA to this email and just wanted to let you know. 
 
Thank you
 
Jack

[EXTERNAL EMAIL]
Hi Gretchen, 

My name is Matthew Jessup and I live at 1100 Fairland road in Silver Spring MD.  I spoke to you via email a few years in regards to a complaint with one of my neighbors who conducts a landscaping business out of his house.  Unfortunately more problems are arising with them so I am hoping to get some assistance from the county to help resolve the issues.

-I share a fence line with my neighbor on 13507 Partridge drive.  He has turned his back yard into an industrial area, removing the grass and laying down gravel for his small fleet of trucks (5-6).  I am aware that he should have no more than 2 work vehicles on his property.  As a staunch environmentalist I am not sure if turning his residential lot into an industrial zone is legal or not, but I know the trucks shouldnï¿½t be there.  When I complained before the trucks were kept off his property for about a month but then they were soon brought back.

-Trash is piling up on the backside of the property facing Fairland road.  He and his workers just throw their trash over the fence with no regard to the environment or his neighbors.  They also recently started throwing their trash over the fence into my yard.  He has also created a brush pile in this same area directly bordering my property.

I am hoping you can help me with this or connect me with someone who can.

Thank you.

They came 3 times for a spring cleanup: April 6,8, and 12.  On the 8th we saw them open the fence and place materials back there.  We wrote emails and text message requesting they remove the materials.  On the 12th when they returned, rather than remove the materials, they placed more out there.  I sent a message saying we'd report them for illegal dumping, and they returned that evening and removed most of the material dumped on the 12th, but not the material placed there previoulsy this year.  It turns out they have been placing material out there for years. We just want them to remove the materials they placed on county land, but they refuse.  They have claimed it was done in previous years and not their responsibility, buy we saw them and took photos. However, if they were correct that it was done in a previous year, it is still their responsibility as the firm has been our exclusive lawn and landscaper for more than 15 years. We have checks to prove it.

1028 UNIVERSITY BLVD, E #923, 
SILVER SPRING, MD 20903

Dear Mr. Guerra, I want your business to do well, but please stop polluting our neighborhoods with these plastic-bag advertisements.  See photo. The little bag (with pebbles and a business flier in it) sit in the gutters, then wash into the storm drains. 
    I have notified the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection and 311 about this pollution.  I called your office last year and asked that you stop this practice.  But this year, I see you are doing it again.  
   Please consider other forms of advertising, such as taking out an ad at PATCH.com or NextDoor.com -- which would probably be more effective than throwing these little plastic bags on the ground.     Please reply so that I know you received this message, and have a good day.
Sincerely, Steve Lapham - in the Quail Valley neighborhood of Montgomery County --- WHERE THIS POLLUTION IS OCCURRING.","2022","Solid Waste","Residential","1028","UNIVERSITY","SILVER SPRING","20902",

Subject: no dumping sign and help with trash hot spot 
 
[EXTERNAL EMAIL]
Hi Reemberto,
Awhile back you connected us with someone in the county who was able to get some No Dumping signs placed around Oakview. One of our neighbors posted his on our listserv:

my neighbors recently picked up a bunch of random trash that people were ridding themselves of up in the county's grassy area at the dead end of dilston...styrofoam cooler, drywall debris, and lots of empty water bottles. in mere days the clean green was home to a range hood and a toilet, both the toilet bowl and the toilet tank. it's really disheartening.

This is the 9900 block of Dilston Rd which end at the beltway. It might be a good spot for a No Dumping sign. Who should we reach out to get this done?

Also maybe the county could do periodic trash removal there.

I have not heard back from Leslie about scheduling a spring clean up here. Do you know if she is still working for the county of if I should reach out to someone else?

Thanks for your help!

Hi Steve,

One of our wildlife staff received a call from a resident that is having issues with someone in her neighborhood dumping yard waste onto her property and into the receiving stream. The address where this is occurring is 10900 Barnwood Lane in Potomac and a tributary to Watts Branch outside of Watts Branch Stream Valley Park (Unit 2).

Subject: Yard Waste & Stream Impacts 
 
Good afternoon,
 
I received a phone call earlier from Carol Lefkowitz, a concerned citizen who lives in Potomac MD (10900 Barnwood Ln). She informed me that someone is continuously dumping their yard waste onto her property and it is beginning to overflow into a small stream that runs through her property and eventually into Watts Branch. She was concerned over the impact that the yard waste may have on the stream.
I told her that unfortunately since her property does not border park property, and the dumping is not occurring on park property, there is not much that we can do. I gave her the non-emergency number for County Police, and suggested that she report what is happening.
I wanted to reach out to you, since my specialty is not with streams, and the stream does eventually flow into Watts Branch Unit 2, so that this could be on your radar, or if you have a way of handling these sorts of situations/complaints. 
 
If you have any suggestions, or would like more info, her number is 301 983 8683.","2021","Solid Waste","Residential","10900","Barn Wood","Potomac","20854","POINT (-77.218053 39.032378)"

I have enforced Montgomery County Recycling Code and Solid Waste Chapter 48 violations in the past with this business.

Dear Madam/Sir,

Unimproved Lots 13 (9329 Belle Terre Way, Potomac, MD 20854) and Lot 14 (9317 Belle Terre Way, Potomac, MD 20854) are owned by Adams Limited Partnership.  Recently, representatives of the owner visited the site and noticed that cut up pieces of a large tree (est. 10 ft. in circumference) had been dumped on the Adams Limited Partnership lots near the adjacent improved and occupied property at 9325 Belle Terre Way.  Inspection revealed that there was a recent stump of a tree of similar size and species located on the front of the property at 9325 Belle Terre Way.   In addition, tracks in the mud can be seen between the driveway of 9325 Belle Terre Way and the dump site.

We knocked on the door today at 12;30 P.M. and talked to someone who identified herself as a caretaker and that the owners were out of town.  I informed her of the illegal dumping, left my name and telephone number, and asked her to contact the owners and have them call me.  She confirmed that she would do so. The owners of 9325 Belle Terre have not contacted us yet.

Normally, we would allow several days to receive a return call, put given the existence of tracks clearly proving the source of the dumped tree, I am contacting you in the hopes that an inspector can be assigned and visit the site before the tracks erode so Adams Limited Partnership does not have to bear the cost of removal.  I took some photos of the tracks but they are not as compelling evidence as seeing it in person. 

We are asking that the County issue a notice, and follow-up if necessary, for the immediate removal of the illegally dumped tree.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thank you.  Brian Crawford Adams Limited Partnership","2021","Solid Waste","Residential","9317","BELLE TERRE","Potomac","20854","POINT (-77.189849 39.010028)"

Last week, someone dumped what looks like rags, plywood,  a few bottles, and some old bamboo stalks across from 3700 Dustin Road.  Is this something that the county can come out and pick up?  And not throw deeper into the woods?

I usually take care of most of the dumping when it happens, but it looks like there is some plywood in this pile. If the county can get it, great; otherwise I?ll take it to the dump myself. 

I just don?t want the county workers to throw it deeper into the woods?it?s easy to load up now while its by the side of the road.

I have lived in the Inverness Forest Association  Inc. HOA since Sept 1980.  This not-for-profit  corporation  of 304 townhomes was established in 1969. 
Townhomes are on Inverness Ridge Road and on Deborah Drive.
I will focus only on illegal dumping  of cut down hardwood trees on the  Deborah Drive side of this HOA neighborhood.  

For the past two decades I noticed illegal  dumping of  cut down  mature hardwood trees in forest/watershed in the three 10711-10973 Deborah Drive cul-de-sacs. 
I was never in a position to observe first hand this illegal dumping. That was until Monday morning, September  28, 2020. I personally
observed the Fernandez Tree Service, licensed arborist, cut down two mature hardwood trees behind 10945 Deborah Drive and illegally roll the trunks,
branches, and leaf material into the forest/watershed behind said property.","2020","Solid Waste","Public Land","10945","Deborah","POTOMAC","20854","POINT (-77.163957 39.034139)"

I've noticed there have been lots of wood, branches, debris, and other garbage people are dumping into the stream and adjacent area.

2 Big Problems
1) People dumping garbage/trash at the stream/culvert
2) Culvert has blockage that is preventing optimal drainage of water; as a result this may cause water backups / flooding

I would like to request a no dumping sign so people will not throw their garbage and trash or other tree trimmings, etc into the stream/culvert area.

As you've probably heard from my neighbors, there is a need to expand the culverts to two.  The recent rains have really caused flooding issues.  Appreciate anything that can be done to remove the blockage of the stream/culvert and prevent people from dumping things (i.e., with a sign)

The DPS permit for the job is #900234.  The construction crew drove their propane powered buggies down Sacks St. into a wooded area on the north side of the worksite and washed concrete residue out of the buckets.  That area is a protected glen that feeds directly into Rock Creek.  There are still tire tracks, white concrete powder and chunks of concrete visible on the ground and in the surrounding undergrowth.  This should be cleaned up before the next rainstorm when it will wash into the creek.  The company, Ev Air Tight should also be fined for polluting a historic glen and protected watershed.  I am happy to meet someone from DEP on site to show them where the illegal dumping occurred.  I have photographs, as well, if that would be helpful.

They are ""scratching"" my car when I drive out. I'm afraid if they fall--with rain or wind storm--emergency vehicles would not be able to make it to the end of our street,  Also, I told the four parties I talked to that someone has dumped a mattress, washing machine, and large trash can in that same area. I live right across the street from part of Matthew Henson Park. Unfortunately, being at the end of a dead end street, this is a constant problem of people dumping trash in that area.

Question or comment * 
I live at 4001 Byrd Road. There is a steam that runs through my property, I believe it is called Joseph's Branch or is a tributary to Joseph's branch.
My neighbors at 3911 Byrd have a history of dumping their yard debris into the easement between our houses (which is related to the stream bed) and the stream bed behind our houses. Last year, in consultation with Montgomery County, we was decided to send a mailing to the community reminding of the illegality of dumping into the stream, rather then to make an issue with my neighbors; and they did after that avail themselves of the county provided Compost bins.
Now, however, I am very dismayed that my neighbors at 3911 Byrd Road have allowed their contractors to dump a major amount of tree trunks and branches into the easement 
between our houses as well as over their back fence into the stream.
I have lived in this house for 20 years and every year I work hard to eliminate the invasive vines that attack my yard and azaleas from the easement. Because my neighbors illegally dump into the easement, they kill the vegetation such that only the vines survive and the large pile of tree trunks provide a perfect platform for the vines to grow into the trees and into my yard.
This practice is detrimental to the efforts the county has made to improve the stream bed. 
This was intentionally done; it is a large amount of debris; and it should be removed. I am sure it was a cost savings to my neighbors or their contractors to dump illegally; however it is really unacceptable. I have photos if that would be helpful.
Please let me know what can be done. Thank you.
I am very upset that this would happen. It is well known to be illegal, and it should be cleaned up.","2020","Solid Waste","Residential","3911","Byrd","KENSINGTON","20895","POINT (-77.079435 39.042204)"

Wood from used pallet, the containers used to hold the stones, random furniture waste, and other items in the vicinity were also disposed by him in same location. The items have been left there for over two years. The grass has been left to grow extremely tall to show that a long length of time has passed. He has tried to state that the my mother has denied him access to remove and dispose of them, when in fact, he wants to keep the items here to avoid storing the items on his own  property in Rockville. These stones used to be stored for at least a decade at Middletown, MD; enough time had passed that the wood from the containers had been turned to soil by various organisms,  so it's clear that if these were intended used for business purposes, he has no market. I made a call out to him on April 4, 2020, and up until now, he has made no contact regarding their removal and disposal. This portion of land is unfenced; hence there is no physical means of denying access. While not strictly relevant, he has a relationship with neighbors Hebron and Randolph, and they have entered my land secretly to make it appear he ""maintains"" the items. His house in Taylor Ave has a newly finished storage building for his stones and that has been there since 2017, one year before convincing my mother, but not me, to store the items here in 2018. These items have been here for over two years. Thus, he has had these stones for over a decade, including the time in Middletown, MD and hasn't his inventory has not changed in that time. I must emphasize the HE wants to keep them here and the WE wish to see such an eyesore removed. He has stymied the removal process since January and claims are not letting him remove it.","2020","Solid Waste","Residential","11805","Prices Distillery","DAMASCUS","20872","POINT (-77.24667 39.281115)"

Before they started they removed 3 or 4 bags of yard waste that they had brought from a previous job, carried it through to the rear of their property and dumped it over the fence into the parkland behind their property
When I told them to stop the dumping they told me that they didn't speak English and continued to dump the waste into the parkland.
I spoked to my neighbor about what had happened and he said that he would speak to the owner of the company.  I assume that he did but I believe that he hears about this matter from the county.","2019","Solid Waste","Public Land","9320","Falls Bridge","POTOMAC","20854","POINT (-77.209682 39.009406)"

They are apparently employed by a neighbor across the street from the park. When confronted, the worker claimed they weren't dumping but I witnessed them using leaf blowers to move leaves into the parkland and there was a wide scrape of cleared area on the ground where they had dragged a tarp for dumping. That was obvious since the rain last night had left the ground littered with leaves. (To be fair, they also were blowing leaves off the sidewalk on county-owned property, but that leaf volume was minimal compared to the leaves they dragged/blew  from across the street). The volume of leaves and yard waste in the park area has accumulated substantially over the last few months; I don't know if they are the only lawn care company to be using the park as a dumping site.","2019","Solid Waste","Residential","2318","ASHBORO","CHEVY CHASE","20815","POINT (-77.049362 38.990562)"

Subject: Burtonsville Crossing shopping center 

[EXTERNAL EMAIL]

Dear Ms. Inman. I left you a phone message in regards to the photos attached. Dumping and illegal parking have grown since the departure of Giant and the other tenants of the Burtonsville Crossing Shopping Center. These pictures were taken just today
on the North end of National Drive which is a loop around property and part of the Montgomery County park and ride system. Over these years, I couldï¿½ve captured much worse as the negligence of the property goes unabated.

I have called the county and SHA with my concerns and they have taken care of things sometimes but the large item in the second picture has been there for years.

This is a regular route for the buses that travel North and South to BWI and the County as they leave the park and ride. I am appalled that my community looks like this to neighbors and strangers.

Can you do something about this? I have ccï¿½ed Steve Martin
Environmental Compliance Supervisor
Montgomery County DEP too. Thanks for your help and attention.



Sincerely,
Amy Horn
Timber Hills Association
Your neighbor on Dustin Road)
