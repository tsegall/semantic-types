We are accepting applications through mid-June and will interview RefAmerica applicants (by phone).  (If you are interested in helping welcome refugee peers, we would suggest that this is an ideal time to focus on the RefAmerica application when you are necessarily at home and practicing social distancing.)  Those accepted into the program can rest assured that so long as they qualify this year, they will have the opportunity to participate with their refugee contemporaries in the in-person program in Washington next year (health conditions permitting), and we will look to our volunteer teen participants this July to provide much-needed moral support to these refugee peers by participating in a few virtual sessions.   
 RefAmerica’s one-month, Washington-based, in-person program scheduled to be held next in 2021 will, as in previous years, will be held in July for  six – ten recently resettled refugee high school students drawn from around the U.S. and six - ten comparably aged American teens from Montgomery County, MD, and surrounding areas.
RefAmerica is a program in leadership, public-speaking, cross-cultural understanding, and the narrative method.  Participants have the opportunity to get to know Washington DC; to learn more about American immigrant stories; to engage in a unique cross-cultural program of sharing traditions, team-building experiences and personal stories; to explore their own roles within a greater American story of immigration and integration; to meet with government and legislative officials, refugee program professionals, and others; and to plan ways to welcome refugees and promote cross-cultural understanding in their home communities.  The goal of RefAmerica is to promote full inclusion of recently arrived refugees in America and provide small groups of participant refugees with the tools both to tell their stories and to help forge for themselves, their families and their fellow refugees, like generations of Americans before them, a new American story.  Volunteer participants in the  July 2021 in-person program are eligible for SSL.   
If you would like to participate in RefAmerica program (in-person July 2021 and virtually July 2020) please email refamericafoundation@gmail.com for an application.
We would also welcome hearing from anyone whose parents might want to host a recently resettled refugee high school student for the month of July 2021 or anyone who is just interested in learning more, helping in fund-raising events, or helping in any other way,
Participation in the summer program is competitive and requires an application, short bio, and resume.  For this volunteer opportunity, we are looking for friendly, outgoing, supportive students with a commitment to and record of community service.  In 2021 (and virtually in 2020), local volunteer participants will join with refugee participants in a wide array of cross-cultural exchange, team-building, and community service activities; build public speaking and leadership skills; and advocate for refugees.  They will offer their refugee contemporaries friendship, welcome, and an introduction to teen life in their new home country.  In 2021, program participants must make a full four-week commitment (including weekends).  In 2020, virtual participation will be 5-8 partial days throughout July (schedule and timing collectively TBD). 
RefAmerica is in its fourth year of bringing refugees and local teens together to tell their stories in a summer program of training, shared experience, and cultural exchange.  Check out  https://twitter.com/refugees/status/998605511833550851 for UNHCR’s animated tweet of Alaa’s story from RefAmerica 2017.  You can also check online for RefAmerica's first-prize essay in the 2018 Dream Builders contest and for various NGO postings about individual refugees who have participated in the RefAmerica program. ","Montgomery County And Greater Washington DC Area","Bethesda","MD","20815","ongoing",,,,"16-19","false",,,"Education / Mentoring",,"MCPS SSL",

In-house, the SAFE Center provides critical legal immigration services and crime  victim’s rights representation. Survivors need a myriad of other legal services to remove barriers to their ability  to move forward with their lives. This volunteer position would build on the pro- and low-bono network the  SAFE Center has initiated with the goal of securing services, particularly on Maryland state law issues, for our  clients in the following areas:  
Family Law: Divorce; custody; securing child support; domestic violence / civil protection orders; guardian ad litem; advocacy within the child welfare system 
Employment Law: Wage and hour violations; employment discrimination 
Civil Rights: Enforce constitutional civil rights to due process, equal protection, and right against  unreasonable search and seizure; protect against housing discrimination  
Public Benefits: Access to public benefits like Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security Insurance, and others;  access to crime victim compensation 
Housing: Landlord / Tenant; access to public housing 
Criminal Justice: Criminal defense for survivors charged with prostitution and related crimes; vacating prostitution-related convictions 
Consumer Protection/Bankruptcy: To help survivors clear debt they were forced to incur by their  traffickers  
Tax: To help survivors understand their rights and responsibilities regarding tax payment 
Attorneys who join our network may be called upon to advise, represent, or otherwise assist a client depending  on their time and resource availability, barring any conflicts.

A student’s parent/guardian must provide the nonprofit with written approval of the student’s participation in the virtual platform prior to the student serving/volunteering.
Students must use personal/private accounts (not MCPS student accounts) to engage in the virtual platform.
Students will only engage with others under the direct supervision of a nonprofit supervisor. The nonprofit supervisor will be directly present in the virtual space (including any breakout sessions) at all times.
The nonprofit supervisor will initiate and host all virtual sessions. If the nonprofit supervisor is not available to initiate and host the virtual session, the session will not occur.
Virtual sessions will not be recorded.
Students should not share or upload any videos, pictures, or images of themselves, unless the nonprofit organization has obtained a signed form/waiver from the student’s parent/guardian authorizing permission/release.
Students’ email addresses/home addresses or any personally identifying information will remain protected and not shared.

Regarding how we will track and verify SSL hours:
--- Students will track their volunteer hours by making a copy of the following template. The document must be titled following the template - (ex: “John Smith_2021-2022 Time Collection”). On the first row list your full name. On the second row, please state if you are applying for the PVSA award.
--- After each class, document the date, the duration and the preparation time of the class. The default total class preparation time is the same as the duration of the class. (Ex. If your class is 40 minutes long, you enter 40 minutes for the class preparation). 
--- If your preparation time is more than the default time, PLE and all its staff reserve the right to view your lesson plans. After reviewing all materials you created in preparation and a possible interview, we determine if the preparation time logged is appropriate or if it should be adjusted based on length, amount, and quality of material. We generally do not award more than 2 hours of preparation time. You will retain copyright over your plans. 
--- Any orientation, training and meeting times will also be counted toward your volunteer time. Please enter the event name, date, and duration. Please be aware preparation time is not applicable to this circumstance (ex: New faculty online orientation, 4/21/2010, 1 hour). 
--- We will send certificates of verified volunteer hours and complete volunteer forms (SSL, NHS, etc.) upon request. 
--- All other forms of volunteering (eg. advertisement, management, newsletter writing, general curriculum development) will be tracked on an hour-for-hour basis the amount of time served when supervised.

Widow Care's Mission
Widow Care’s mission is to provide targeted and accessible content & connections to DC,Maryland and Virginia residents facing the loss of a spouse, so they can become empowered in their walk through grief and new challenges. We do so by providing peer support groups, social meet-ups, mentorship & education to help members regain stability after tragedy.
There are 680,204 widowed men and women living in DC, Maryland and Virginia. Furthermore, 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 are widowed. While widowhood is so incredibly widespread, few resources exist to aid surviving spouses in their transition into widowhood.
Widowed persons are at an increased risk of depression, social isolation and serious health problems, and we aim to combat this by creating a strong and supportive network comprised of understanding individuals. We encourage members to attend entertaining and enjoyable events, while also encouraging them to find a support system which allows them to speak about their challenges. Our educational programs & local service connections aim to make the transition into widowhood easier by offering pertinent services & education.
Widow Cares VisionOur founders’ vision for the organization involves widow(er)s helping other widow(er)s. We walk with our members throughout their healing process by offering specialized care & support, and we enable them to ""give back"" by donating their time or funds to help other widowed persons in the community. We aim to offer the highest level of support by connecting individuals with a multitude of resources, not limited to our own events/programs. We strive to work with other nonprofits, support groups & organizations in our area to ensure ample support.
Widow Cares Core Values
Widow Care incorporates 4 main core values into all of our programs, operations & communications: Compassion, Care, Community & Empowerment.

Our expanded Board of Directors will represent the diverse communities where we live, work, and offer free after-school and summer courses.  We also have seats available on our committees: Racial Equity Committee, Governance Committee, Fundraising Committee, and Finance Committee. You can choose to nominate yourself for the Board elections or you can volunteer to sit on a committee without being a Board member. 
 
 Priorities For Our Board Search: We seek leaders to help us build relationships with and for families who need the most support - to help us improve the quality and depth of our programs, increase the number of programs, and provide the wrap-around support that middle and high school students need to thrive. Our priority is for all of the new Board Members to be community leaders and media or education professionals who are part of, or especially qualified to represent, the underserved and BIPOC families and communities in this region. 
How To Nominate a Board Candidate: Any community member or local professional, student, parent, teacher, or program alumni is encouraged to nominate a candidate or self-nominate as a candidate by emailing the Nominating Committee at nominations@gandhibrigade.org with Board Nomination in the subject line. Please include the full name of the nominee, brief information about why the nominee would be a good candidate to help lead GBYM, and, if permitted by the nominee, contact details for the nominee, as well as contact details for the person nominating. GBYM will respond with questions or next steps such as scheduling an in-person conversation or inviting nominees to attend a GBYM event. Each Board opening will be open until filled. 
Who We Are and Our Values: Our free after-school and summer programs teach young people how to research and report on social justice and civic issues through documentary film. These young students find their voices and confidence to develop as leaders, while learning valuable digital media skills by producing short documentaries, PSA’s and short narrative pieces that are published on our YouTube Channel: www.youtube.com/gandhibrigade. 
As an organization, we prioritize racial and economic equity in all of the choices we make to deliver quality programming focused on social justice issues. Our goal is to work in the community, alongside community leaders, as a community-led organization. By involving our communities in our leadership, and focusing on the quantity and quality of our programming, we will continue to increase our positive impact both internally and externally.
Board Activities: Our Board is a friendly and active group of community members interested in social justice and youth development. The Board actively supports the success of the Executive Director and the Program Manager. The Executive Director reports to the Board. The Board meets every two months on the second Tuesday of the month. Each Board-member serves on a committee such as Racial Equity, Fundraising, Finance, or Governance. Members host or participate in various organization events. Board-members agree to a ‘give-or-get’ program, committing to one or more of the following: an annual financial gift, local contacts, fundraising connections, or time and expertise. Our board-members provide valuable perspectives, expertise, and experience to help the organization best welcome and serve youth in under-represented families. 
Our New Home: Expanding Our Voices is a capital campaign with a goal of $550,000 to expand the scope of our media productions, and double the impact of our free education programs.  Through the campaign, Gandhi Brigade Youth Media raised enough funds to build our own headquarters and studio space, creating a permanent hub for our network of satellite classroom spaces across the county.  Our new headquarters occupies 3000 square feet in the Silver Spring Library building at 900 Wayne Ave, on a generous long-term lease from Montgomery County. The campaign is still ongoing to increase and broaden our youth media programming.
History of GB Youth Media: Local activist Richard Jaeggi founded the organization in 2005 with the belief that teaching young people media skills would give them a voice, develop the next generation of leaders, and shape social consciousness in the process. Based in libraries, schools, and charitable institutions around the county, the neighborhood classes Richard started have flourished, enabling hundreds of youth to develop as students and as leaders. Richard Jaeggi named the Gandhi Brigade out of his admiration for Gandhi's commitment to active non-violence. Richard took Gandhi's writings regarding the creation of a ""Peace Brigade of believers"" to heart, combining this idea with the development of 21st century skills in order to effectively spread this message. Evan Glass became Executive Director when Richard passed very suddenly in 2014. Evan and the Board of Directors expanded the programs and obtained the Montgomery County long-term lease to give the organization a permanent home. After Evan was elected to the Montgomery County Council, Anna Danielson became Executive Director in November 2018. 
Our Name
Gandhi Brigade was named by its founder, Richard Jaeggi, in 2008. Richard chose the name Gandhi Brigade because (to paraphrase Richard): Gandhi’s well-known commitment to nonviolence was not at all passive; it was designed as active refusal through peaceful means to thwart any kind of injustice. To be sure, at Gandhi Brigade we teach our young people to think about justice in the world and express in their actions through their creative media all the values that Gandhi most hoped for: inclusion, courage, and love. We have retired the original name of the organization but our priority for peace remains.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused even greater disadvantages to our already marginalized student population, which is why our students need additional support to help navigate challenges as they attend Montgomery College, a vocational training program, work full-time, or choose to re-access their education plan.Students enter the Future Link program through a 15-week Self-Advocacy and Career Development Seminar, after which they are matched with a mentor.Mentors meet the student where they are, working with them on:

Soft skills such as time management, communication, and asking for help.
Evaluating career paths and required education or training requirements.
Preparing transfer applications and researching and applying for scholarships.
Creating a resume, cover letter and LinkedIn profile.
Navigating the complexities of higher education and office/company cultures.
Critically thinking through decisions and brainstorming outcomes.
Working through external factors (family pressures, work commitments, mental health).

Mentors become the regular point of contact with the student and the Future Link staff. In addition, Future Link provides resources as needed to support the student and mentor. For instance, if the student needs to create a budget or a LinkedIn profile and that is not the mentor's strength, a different volunteer will work with the student in that area.Mentors attend two training sessions and a one-on-one meeting with staff before meeting their mentee. Continuous support is provided once matched with a mentee. We request an initial one-year commitment with an option to continue beyond that time frame. Mentors must be 30+ years of age, live or work in Montgomery County, Maryland and have at least five years’ work experience in their career field.There is no greater reward then helping transform a life!Apply online today at futurelinkmd.org/mentor-application. Once your application has been received, a Future Link staff member will contact you to schedule a conversation to learn more.","15 West Gude Drive, Suite 150","Rockville","MD","20850","ongoing",,,,"30-120","false",,,"Education / Mentoring",,,"POINT (-77.159231 39.106636)"

Friendly Visitor Volunteers play a critical role in the lives of older adults in the community by visiting individuals who may be isolated and lonely. Friendly Visitor matches volunteers age 21 and over with older adults within the community who are isolated and lonely. Matches are made based on the volunteer and client's geographic location, shared interests, and backgrounds. Friendly visitor clients are older adults who have lived rich and interesting lives but may be isolated because of their health and diminishing social networks. Volunteers serve as a friend and companion who can visit once a week to share stories and check in. Visits may include opportunities to play board games, cook, read, take a walk, or chat about current events. Volunteers typically spend 1 hour per week with their client. 
Current volunteer opportunities with Friendly Visitor are remote. Due to Covid-19, in-person visits are suspended but older adults are in greater need of companionship than ever before! Volunteers will be matched with a Friendly Visitor client and expected to complete a virtual visit or phone call once a week for up to 1-hour. The expectation is that the volunteer and client will begin to meet in person once safety guidelines have established that it is safe to do so and both the client and volunteer are comfortable meeting in person. 
EveryMind provides training and unlimited support to volunteers throughout their volunteer experience. Quarterly volunteer meetings are held with additional educational opportunities. 
Be a part of the important work EveryMind is doing and make a difference in someone’s life! Interested in being a friend to someone in need? 1 hour of orientation is held every month. We have moved our orientation virtually.

The “V” is now participating in an “Adopt a Neighborhood” program with the City of Gaithersburg. The Gaithersburg CARES Hub was created in May 2020 as a consolidation center for essential health items and food for children, families and seniors recovering from COVID-19 at home. From May to October, Seneca Creek Community Church and the City of Gaithersburg partnered to create this primary receiving, inventory, and packaging center to deliver items to those in need.
With the support of a grant from Montgomery County, the Gaithersburg CARES Hub project expanded its services, continuing to operate at its current location at Seneca Creek Community Church, 13 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.
Victory Christian Church International has adopted the Seneca Village Apartments to serve in a food distribution each month.  We are looking for partners to join with us each month at the distribution by volunteering your time to serve the needs of our adopted community in the following manner

Food prep at Gaithersburg Cares Hub (Seneca Creek Church - 13 Firstfield Rd. Gaithersburg, MD  20878) - Saturday mornings -9:00 - 10:30am
Food delivery to Seneca Village Apartments, (750 Clopper Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20878) - Saturday morning - 9:45- 10:30am
Food delivery to residents within the Seneca Village Apartments - Saturday morning - 11:00am - 12:30pm

This is a great opportunity for families to help! Students can earn SSL hours for helping with food prep, and while delivery time won’t count for SSL hours, it is a critical part of this project and another great way families can help.

We continue to provide support in the social and emotional development and maturity assisting the high school girl in graduating high school with a plan for college and/or career. She will also have the specific tools and resources to execute the plan with minimal barriers and the know-how to overcome any barriers that may present themselves. In that vain, the CB Girls High School Mentoring initiative will allow girls to: 1) Develop/Build healthy positive relationships and the ability to network with people of different demographics. 2) Increase their exposure and awareness of careers in multiple sectors allowing them to develop an aspirational life path through exposure to what is possible and achievable for everyone. 3) Mentors will develop a deeper understanding of the challenges minority girls are experiencing and be more equipped to support them and challenge them beyond their current lens of understanding and barriers. Mentors must complete a criminal and child background check, attend a virtual mentor orientation, and be committed to once a month engagement with their mentee.

An application and background check is required and training is provided.
Volunteers can also choose to help as a driver (driving seniors to or from doctor's appointments, etc), absent owner services (such as watering plants or picking up packages) or to do light home repair tasks (such as lifting boxes, fixing door hinges, hanging drapes, etc), limited snow removal, or provide limited technical assistance for computers and other devices.  
Volunteer service providers can be any age (over 18), and do not have to be members of BMAV themselves.  You choose which service requests you would like to accept - there is no requirement to take any minimum number of requests and you do what is convenient for you. Most requests are on weekdays but there is great flexibility in dates.
Volunteering is a wonderful way to contribute to your community.

The Health Home Team will:
 

Collaborate with clinical, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and other providers to implement the treatment plan;
Increase consumers’ and family members’ ability to manage care and live safely in the community; and
Emphasize proactive health promotion and self-management.

 
Description of the program:
 
Health Home offers enhanced services and supports for participants with serious mental
health issues, emotional disturbance, and opioid substance use disorders. The
complexity of managing these conditions often increases the challenges of treating and
preventing additional chronic health issues, both behavioral and somatic. Those with
behavioral health conditions face unique barriers in addressing their physical health
needs, resulting in disproportionately poor health outcomes, low engagement in
preventive health efforts, and high rates of avoidable hospital and emergency
department (ED)encounters. Health Home assists participants of all ages in improving
overall wellness through a whole-person approach to addressing their behavioral,
somatic, and social needs. Becoming a Health Home allows behavioral health providers
to augment their existing services, building upon and adding to their staff and activities
to better serve participants. This is accomplished through connecting participants and
caregivers to the myriad of supports and services available to them, offering health
promotion activities, monitoring both somatic and behavioral health needs, and assisting
with transitional care. The Health Home becomes the locus of care, building
participants’ self-management capacity while reducing avoidable hospital usage and
ultimately improving outcomes.
 
Like adults with serious mental illness, children and adolescents with serious emotional
disturbance face an elevated risk of adverse health consequences. While all Health Homes aim to reduce these negative outcomes, those serving children
emphasize coordinated prevention, health promotion, and wellness activities that focus
on their health-related choices and behaviors. These efforts involve augmenting the existing
services provided to children with SED through not only the somatic and behavioral
health care systems, but also through local school systems, the child welfare and
juvenile justice authorities when applicable, and other child and family service providers
as appropriate.

Mentors play an integral role in showing mentees the vast array of opportunities that may be available to them in the US, as well as supporting and empowering them to explore these opportunities. Volunteers are encouraged to meet youth outside of their homes at coffee shops such as Starbucks.

Composer’s Circle is a tutoring program run by the Tacy Foundation that aims to teach the valuable skills of composition and music theory through personalized one-on-one instruction that meets students at their level to help them achieve their composition goals. In addition to musical production, composition education has everyday benefits; learning music theory improves critical thinking skills, and sharing creative work increases confidence.
Volunteers will learn how to compose music. Many young musicians play music from centuries past, but do not learn how to compose their own music.  The tools for this will be offered. Then, the expectation will be for the students to compose music that will be played for seniors, hospitals, and recorded on CDs for shipment to hospitals, Fisher Houses for wounded military, and to disaster areas where hope is greatly needed.
Michael Tacy, Composer and Arranger, teaches online.  Lots of opportunities to learn how to compose music that will later be shared in the community.
Composition and music theory are deeply linked, as theory is necessary to explain composition concepts -- while this may seem daunting, never fear. Theory is best taught as a class, and the one-on-one instruction will ensure the student fully understands theory and notation so they can best grasp the principles of composition and convey their work to others. This is the goal of Composer’s Circle: to create something wonderful and share it.

The High School student schedules a piano lesson on a weekly or bi-weekly basis with an interested senior.  The lessons begin anywhere from the beginner level to the level where the senior is.  If a beginner, the teen uses Piano for Adult Beginners provided by Faber Piano Adventures.   If the senior student has played, the teen brings materials that are meaningful to the senior.  
Piano lessons are great platforms for seniors to connect with a youth.  Present and past are conjoined through the music that is studied and the conversation that inevitably unfolds.  A relationship is forged through the attention of a teen who is knowledgeable in music and eager to learn from the senior about history, family, culture, and the aging brain. The senior has time.  
These sessions will be under supervision of an adult volunteer on the premises.  Scheduled by the Activity Director of the assisted living facility.

""When asked to share why I volunteer on the Frederick County Citizens Review Board (CRBC), I immediately thought of The Starfish Story adapted from a book by Loren Eiseley. This story tells the tale of a young boy who frantically tries to save starfish stranded on a beach by throwing them back into the sea - one by one. A skeptic tells the young boy he is wasting his time, and he cannot make a difference to the thousands of starfish on the beach. The young boy picks up a starfish, throws it in the water, and says, It makes a difference to that one. Making a difference in the life of each child in foster care is an important focus for me. For this reason, after hearing about the CRBC from a former state CRBC staff member, I have been volunteering on the CRBC in Frederick County for eleven years. By volunteering, I am able to review cases to ensure the needs of each child are taken care of while in out-of-home placement. In addition, as part of the review process, I can also make recommendations that lead to a loving, safe, and permanent home for each child after he/she leaves the system. For me, each case I review matters - one by one. My hope is by serving on the Frederick County CRBC and advocating on behalf of children in foster care, I can make a difference in the lives of these children that will matter now and will have a positive, lasting impact for generations to come."" - Wanet Tyson, CRBC Volunteer

You can be a part of this program too! 
Your participation will help reduce trash and litter along County roads and maintain a clean and attractive environment.  Ultimately it helps protect the Chesapeake Bay.  Litter that is washed into storm drains, travels to nearby creeks, streams, major rivers, and eventually can reach the Bay.
With the amount of trash littered on the roadside every day, and budget constraints within the County resulting in less mowing and road cleaning, your involvement has becoming increasingly important. AAR allows residents to demonstrate community pride, make a positive statement for a clean and attractive community, and have a better understanding of storm water pollution.

We're looking for individuals who have experience and expertise in various elementary and middle school courses to serve as virtual tutors for the children of our Scholars. Generation Hope Scholars are teen parents that are pursuing a college education to make a better life for themselves and their child. And as COVID-19 leaves many of our Scholars balancing both their own virtual learning and their child's virtual learning, we are looking for some volunteer tutors to help alleviate some of the stress experienced by Scholars.
Time Commitment:  As needed, typically once a week for about an hour. You will be contacted by our Tutoring Coordinator when your help is needed.

GENERATION HOPE VOLUNTEER FORM
About Generation Hope: Generation Hope is the only community-based nonprofit organization in the DMV region focused on college completion and early childhood success for two populations that are dismissed regarding their potential and dreams for the future: teen parents and their children. Founded in 2010, Generation Hope selects teen mothers and teen fathers who have displayed academic achievement and a desire to go to college to become Scholars in the Generation Hope Scholar Program.  Once accepted, Generation Hope provides each Scholar with three supports that we believe increase the likelihood that they will obtain their college degree; up to $2,400 per year in tuition assistance, one-on-one mentoring, and case management. Additionally, Scholars receive an increased network of support from the extended family that the program provides to them and to their young children. This support stays with Scholars until they earn their two or four-year degree. Our tutors are a critical piece of this support, as they help make it possible for our Scholars to thrive in higher education.

Hospice Volunteers play an important role as part of JSSA Hospice’s interdisciplinary team by supporting a patient and their family at end of life. Whether this is done remotely or in person, hospice volunteers enhance the experience of patients and families with their compassion and supportive presence.

They provide in person visits from initial admission to our service, to the last days and hours of life by sitting with patients and families to ensure they are never alone.
Volunteers bring comfort, respite, and companionship at a time when compassionate support is critically needed.

Completion of this form, including the required signatures, is required by all volunteers to participate in this SSL opportunity.
Please do not use your MCPS email to respond with us as we cannot not reply to you via this type of email address.
This is a great opportunity to gain volunteer experience helping Arise and Flourish, a non-profit organization based in Montgomery County, Maryland that speaks to students about substance abuse addiction.  During the last seven years, Arise and Flourish has paved the way through public and private schools on educating our youth of the dangers associated with addiction. Our program delivers a robust and real-life look into the cycle of addiction and provides an understanding, knowledge and in-sight on how to exercise prevention. Arise and Flourish’s family of dedicated volunteers have delivered our program to more than 135 schools and have reached nearly 17,000 students with our impactful message of prevention and hope. In addition to our visits to schools, we are also asking for the student’s assistance to continue the education of addiction and prevention through SSL hours. 
What students will do:
Student will first need to complete the volunteer form/parent/guardian permission slip and submit via to e-mail info@ariseandflourish.org. Please note that MCPS has not vetted the YouTube videos created by our organization and parents/guardians are responsible for previewing the videos and then providing parent permission for their students to view the videos. 
Once approved, students will watch two video presentations provided by our organization. 

One video is our speakers who are people in recovery who share their personal experience
The second video is the presentation on the cycle of addiction which has information on how addiction happens. 

Students can obtain SSL hours in two ways:

Write a 2-page paper on their understanding of drug and alcohol prevention on the information received from the two videos. Papers will only be reviewed by our organization.
Create an art project based upon their understanding of prevention on the information they received from the videos. Art projects might be shared on our social media platforms so please review the privacy information below when submitting your project.

How to earn community service hours (SSL):
Students have the ability to earn 1 SSL hour for the quality completion of this project and can earn up to 4 SSL hours for each speaker video watched and paper written (up to 4 speaker videos along with the one video for the cycle of addiction).
When your paper or art project is complete, e-mail info@ariseandflourish.org your 2-page paper or an electronic copy of your art project to collect your signed SSL sheet for this project. Students will need to cc their parents as well on the email submission. Please allow 3-5 business days to receive your signed SSL form.
Privacy:
Please, do not share any pictures or likeness of the students as well as personal information such as home address, email or phone number etc. in your paper or artwork. Also, please do not include any real-life pictures or images of yourself. We ask that students include their first name, grade and school only on each submission.
Student participation in this service project is at the discretion of the student’s parent/guardian. The nonprofit organization is responsible for maintaining student safety and privacy at any time the student is interacting with the nonprofit and its clients.

G.R.OWN Foods stands for Girls Raising Our OWN Foods, and we strive to help girls get outside and learn to tend and grow a garden for their own consumption, and sell produce in their own booth in a local farmer's market.
We want to encourage healthy food choices and use gardening as a way to understand the food chain.  Importantly, we hope to work with our girls to help establish a more reasonable pace of life by practicing patience and understanding the patterns and timing of seed-time-harvest.
If you have experience with seasonal or year-round vegetable, herb, and fruit gardening, and think you could provide hands-on instruction to a small group at your convenience, we would love for you to work with us.  Workshops would take place at our garden plot in spring/summer weather-permitting, as well as indoors at library or other community-based locations in Silver Spring, Maryland.
For the fall season, we could use some expertise in how to create small indoor gardens, and how to preserve the soil and prepare the ground for winter.
In spring, we would like to learn about how to select seeds, grow seedlings, prepare fertile ground for planting, planting strategies, and various types of gardening - in and out of soil.
We are also in need of carpenters to teach our group how to build raised beds for gardening as well as indoor gardening shelves.
We hope to partner with Home Depot or Lowe's for donations of gardening and building supplies.  We would be happy to have an adult volunteer to take on establishing that partnership and soliciting donations on our behalf.

Our Montgomery County branch of AAAS-STEM Volunteers recruits for STEM professionals interested in volunteering in Montgomery County Public Schools, at levels K-12. Retired volunteers usually commit to one day a week in their school classroom(s) of choice. Non-retired volunteers commit to at least one hour per week in the classroom. Here is a video of volunteers in the MCPS classrooms: https://youtu.be/HP4vvqKf4bQ
Our organization works to connect interested volunteers to MCPS teachers who are seeking STEM volunteers in their classrooms. We attempt to match the volunteer's interest in serving at a particular grade level (K-12) to a requesting school that lies within a reasonable commuting distance. At any one time, we usually have multiple requests for volunteers from teachers in MCPS grades K-5, 6-8, and 9-12. 
Volunteers work directly with teachers and students in many different ways to promote students' knowledge and love of science, and to demonstrate how science is important in the lives of everyone in our society.
MCPS teaching for the 2020-2021 school year will be conducted online, until in-person teaching is deemed to be safe for students and staff. We are currently working with MCPS administration to define the ways our volunteers can be most effective in supporting MCPS teachers in the Fall.

You may be able to take a litter of kittens (or puppies) that have no mother for up to 8 weeks. You could care for a cat with an upper respiratory Kittens infection until he feels better, or help rehabilitate a dog with a broken leg that is healing. You might take home a rabbit to make room for new arrivals in our small-mammals area. We have lots of animals that need your care, especially older cats who truly benefit from spending time away from the shelter before they find their forever homes. Supplies and care. We furnish all the supplies you need, including food, litter, bedding, toys and enrichment items, and medical care. Foster parents are responsible for traveling to and from the shelter for medical care and foster care appointments. The frequency of appointments varies depending on the reason an animal is being fostered.
Time Commitment: Fostering may last anywhere from two weeks to several months, depending on the pet’s needs. If you are interested in fostering with MCASAC, please follow these steps:

Submit an application on our website
Attend an orientation. You will learn about policies and procedures for the program. Orientations will be held on a quarterly basis.
Fill out background check form. Forms will be submitted for review and returned in a couple of weeks. To be admitted to the program you must pass the background check.
Attend foster training. You will learn about program expectations, basic medical information, and have all your questions answered.
Start saving lives. MCASAC will match you with the foster animals that suit your lifestyle.

*Criteria: Be of age. The primary caregiver of the foster animal must be at least 18 years old. Be in the area. Foster volunteers must be able to get to our shelter in Derwood Maryland on a regular basis. Please consider the potential commute before applying to foster. Please note that MCASAC cannot accommodate those seeking to fulfill court-ordered community service.

Clarksburg is a great place to live, but sometimes it can feel like there is never anything to do and nowhere to go. 
We want to make Clarksburg better by creating great places for the community to hang out and play games along the Frederick Road bike path. ""The Clarksburg Yard"" is a new and upcoming outdoor venue that creates a place for Clarksburg to become a community/to hang out. 
This summer we are starting to develop ""The Clarksburg Yard"" by building picnic tables, benches, and yard games, to be along the bike path for passers-by to use and enjoy. 
No matter what your experience level, there is a way for you to help make this happen. 
What will I be doing? 
You will meet at 4pm and work in teams of 3-4 to assemble picnic tables and yard games. Each table will take 30 min-1hr to build and you can expect to build 1-2 tables and two yard games. After you are done, you will paint and stain the wood. You will be working outside, so please bring sunscreen and water bottles and wear closed-toed shoes.

Madison Fields is a 400-acre farm dedicated to enriching the lives of differently-abled adults, children, and veterans through our Equine Assisted Activities and Therapies Program. We are currently looking to grow our volunteer family!
Volunteers would help in the barn, both in and out of lessons, to ensure that each session runs as smoothly as possible. Tasks include: grooming and tacking up horses, assisting participants during the mounting and dismounting process, and participating in their lessons as either a side-walker or horse leader.
Volunteers may also be asked to help with barn chores like cleaning stalls.
No prior horse experience is required, only a desire to learn! We ask that all potential volunteers attend an hour long volunteer training session before participating with us.
We are open Tuesday - Sunday from 10 am-3 pm for volunteers! We are happy to have help around the barn caring for the horses, and working around the farm!  Lessons are held Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 11:30 am to 5 pm. 
The minimum age to participate in lessons is 14. We encourage children ages 9 and up to volunteer in the barn with parental supervision!
Please email us at: volunteer@madisonfields.org for more information on how you can get involved!

KEEN has opportunities on the weekends from September through June. In Montgomery County, those opportunities are mostly on Sundays at KEEN Sports for Kids, Teens or Young Adults. (Ask about other opportunities as well.) 
During KEEN's Sports Programs, athletes (KEEN's young people with disabilities, ages 5-25) and volunteers come together for one-to-one activities in a group setting. Together they do individual activities that are tailored solely to the needs of the athlete. They may throw a basketball or kick a soccer ball, or they may take a walk around the outdoor track. Many love to bounce on 36"" balls or be pulled along the floor on a flat wheeled scooter. A group may form for Duck, Duck, Goose. The session ends with everyone coming together in a circle (although some athletes still need to run around its periphery, and that's okay) and sharing with the group what they did that day ""that made them very Proud."" They literally go out dancing: the Hokey Pokey for the younger kids and the Macarena for the teens and young adults. Athletes burn energy, meet and interact with new volunteers, see old friends, and then rejoin their parents, who have had some precious respite time.

BCCRS volunteers gain experience at all levels of the fire-rescue service, beginning with taking training courses to begin serving as a charge EMT on an ambulance, all the way up to chief fire officer. The experience is unparalleled, and all training is provided free of charge. Our members most often describe their rescue squad experience as fun, challenging, and rewarding.
In order to begin volunteering at the Rescue Squad, you need to be at least 16. If you are between 16 and 18 years old, you are considered a Junior Member. Requirements for Junior Members are somewhat different than for someone who joins at 18, but you will be able to progress through EMT class and Firefighter 1 and 2 (if you may wish to participate in the Fire/Rescue track) before turning 18.
Minimum Qualifications

Junior members must have reached their 16th birthday, and not yet reached the second semester of their junior year of high school.
Medical clearance by the Montgomery County Fire/Rescue Operational Medical Service (FROMS). FROMS administers a comprehensive physical examination including a vision test, hearing test, chest x-ray, tuberculosis screening, cardiac stress test, blood tests, and drug screening.
Criminal background check, fingerprinting and inquiries to determine suitability of the applicant for a position of trust in the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad and the Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service. In addition, junior members must have a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) or better to be considered for membership and must agree to maintain a passing GPA.
Possess a strong desire to participate in a time-intensive “after-school” activity during their junior and senior high school years. Note:  Training and certifications earned as a junior member carry over to regular membership, however, not all junior members continue on as adult members.
Junior members must have a strong desire to complete a demanding activity during their junior and senior years of high school which must be prioritized in their time commitments only behind school and family responsibilities.
Have exceptional drive to continually better yourself and your level of skill. The Bethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad needs people that constantly strive to better their skills, qualifications and meet exceptionally high standards of performance.

General Information about the Medical Reserve Corps
The Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) is a national network of community-based groups  of volunteers—medical and public health professional and others—who assist their  communities in activities that promote and strengthen public health, emergency response, and community resiliency. The Medical Reserve Corps supports a variety of public health services during a crisis, such as assisting with mass distribution of antibiotics or vaccines, assisting in mass sheltering, and supporting many other vital public health mission areas. Volunteers may also serve a vital role by assisting their communities with ongoing public health needs (e.g., immunizations, screenings, health and nutrition education, surveillance and disease outbreak investigations).
Through the MRC volunteers have opportunities to participate in training, interact with other health and emergency response professionals, and provide support to the mission areas of the MRC. Examples of the mission areas include:

Surveillance and disease outbreak investigation
Emergency Sheltering
Disaster Risk Reduction
Medical Surge Capacity

Background:
Our pantry is a Choice Food Pantry where clients come in to choose and shop (they do not pay) for food and toiletries. Our pantry is open 3 days a week. We serve anyone that resides in Montgomery County. We serve over 320 families per month. The provision of food is a very important service, as there is a great need for food in the community. Additionally, because of the need for food, people who donate often overlook the need for toiletries. We rarely have toiletries available. Our food pantry maintains the dignity and respect of all who utilize it. During this time of COVID, we are not in need of food donations, but rather, the community we serve is in need of toiletries/household items. Please see below for the wish list.
Toiletry wish list:

Toiletries: toothpaste, toothbrush, bath soap (bar or liquid), shampoo and/or conditioner, deodorant, mouthwash

You may or may not add the following household items to your toiletry drive:

Household items: laundry detergent, toilet paper (no bigger than a 4-pack), paper towels, all-purpose cleaning agents, tissues

The mission of the Montgomery County SAO’s Community Outreach Division is to enhance crime prevention and education throughout the county.

Thus, our Community Outreach Unit works closely with schools, businesses, religious institutions, and other community groups to address and impact crime before it occurs. Assistant State’s Attorneys and staff attend community meetings, police roll calls, and many other local events to connect with Montgomery County residents and learn about community issues. Their goal is to proactively identify problem areas and to allocate the necessary resources to meet the needs of the community. Within the Community Outreach team are several crime prevention and diversionary programs including truancy, opioid abuse, and cybercrime prevention. 
The intern/volunteer will assist the Community Outreach Division in coordinating several of its crime prevention programs. This may include:
-serving as a mentor for the Truancy Prevention Program in Montgomery County Middle Schools
-helping to coordinate initiatives, such as:
The Speak Up, Save a Life Opioid Overdose Prevention Program

About Generation Hope: Generation Hope is the only community-based nonprofit organization in the DMV region focused on college completion and early childhood success for two populations that are dismissed regarding their potential and dreams for the future: teen parents and their children. Founded in 2010, Generation Hope selects teen mothers and teen fathers who have displayed academic achievement and a desire to go to college to become Scholars in the Generation Hope Scholar Program.  Once accepted, Generation Hope provides each Scholar with three supports that we believe increase the likelihood that they will obtain their college degree; up to $2,400 per year in tuition assistance, one-on-one mentoring, and case management. Additionally, Scholars receive an increased network of support from the extended family that the program provides to them and to their young children. This support stays with Scholars until they earn their two or four-year degree. Our tutors are a critical piece of this support, as they help make it possible for our Scholars to thrive in higher education.","415 Michigan Avenue NE","Washington","DC","20017","ongoing",,,,"0-0","false",,"susanne@supportgenerationhope.org","Education / Mentoring",,,"POINT (-77.000005 38.931619)"

There is an exciting volunteer opportunity to provide direct care to animals rescued by the Humane Society of the United States’ Animal Rescue Team at their animal care and rehabilitation center in Washington County, MD – about an hour and a half from DC. The exact location is confidential until you are selected to volunteer, as some of the animals are part of active criminal investigations involving alleged and convicted cruelty or neglect. Other animals are rescued from South Korean dog meat farms, shut down by the HSUS’ international affiliate, Humane Society International (learn more here).
This center is in our backyard and is a great way to provide care for animals in need from all over our country until custody is gained and/or placement is secured through one of the organization’s shelter placement partners. On average, the center houses 60-150 dogs at a time, has 4-6 animal care volunteers daily, and is supported by an HSUS staff of 4-5.
There are few options to volunteer: 

Sign up to become a fully onboarded Animal Rescue Volunteer – learn more here – enabling you to volunteer at the MD center but also deploy with the team nationally as opportunities arise.
Apply here to volunteer just at the MD center by becoming a ‘Center Support’ volunteer. Note: this option is reserved just for those living in the immediate Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia areas.
For those living in the immediate Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia areas, come out just for the day as an individual or group (apply here for a singular daylong shift) or help with a special project/need like fostering, transporting, or administrative support – the team will send you more information for these specialized roles. There are also opportunities to apply human or veterinary medical skills as well as animal behavior knowledge in addition to animal care duties. The volunteer manager will share more – just note this in your application and/or email communications with the Animal Rescue Volunteer program team.

There is an immediate and ongoing need for volunteers.

Need:  RWC volunteers are needed in every area of Montgomery County where requests are made for a “honey do” household chore.  Time is flexible and both men and women, all abilities, are needed.
 
Job Description:  RWC volunteers will perform honey-do, neighborly handyman repairs as requested by PIC members.
 
Duties and Responsibilities:  

Contact the requesting PIC member as soon as possible to schedule the repair at a time that is convenient for both.
Perform the tasks they are capable of completing, always honoring the mission of neighborly assistance.  Upon assessment, if the task is beyond their skill level or the mission of PIC, they will report back to the Member Care Staff.
Perform only those tasks requested and listed on the request for service sheet.
It is the responsibility of the member making the request to provide the necessary supplies to complete the task, when possible.  Small purchases, that a member cannot pay for, must be approved by the Member Care Staff before the job is completed.
Report hours and miles once the job is completed.  
Any additional issues, concerns, or new requests should be reported, as well.

 
RWC Volunteer Criteria:  Receive on the job training and shadow members of the Member Care Staff and RWC lead.  Communication with the Member Care Staff will be on-going, and will include discussion of any issues or process improvements.  Must be a member of PIC and have an understanding of PIC and its culture to enable effective interactions on the phone and in the office.  The receptionist will honor the confidentiality of our members and staff and conduct themselves in a manner that is appropriate to a business office.
 
Qualifications:  RWC volunteers will perform the tasks they say they can perform in a timely manner.  Members do the best they can, based on their own experiences with household repairs.  PIC does not offer “warranties” on repairs.  If the problem persists, we often refer the member to a professional contractor.
 
Supervision:  These volunteers are monitored by a RWC lead volunteer and Member Care Staff.  The RWC lead may seek the assistance of community groups to perform larger jobs or those that may require specific skills which a group might offer.

The exercise class specializes in osteo health and it's the perfect volunteer job for people wanting to help others (and themselves) maintain and/or increase their bone mass. We have volunteers with a huge variety of backgrounds. 
Most of our leaders are older adults who derive enormous satisfaction working with people like Linda, an 87-year-old woman whose doctor strongly urged her to take these classes to help build bone mass naturally. You might be able to help Jenny, a 75-year old woman who fell earlier this year who has been helped enormously by our balance exercises. Or, you might be able to help John, a 92-year old who loves being around other seniors and wants to help his thinning bones and deteriorating balance.
In the free training we provide, you will learn our evidence-based exercises and also learn about teaching seniors. Our one-day training and required visits to three ongoing classes will prepare you to lead. The classes meet two days weekly, one-hour each day, and you are required to teach both days of the week. We know everyone takes vacations, etc, but there is flexibility built into the position as each class has two primary co-leaders as well as one or more secondary co-leaders who are also trained and ready to lead if one of the primary leaders is absent. If you have never taken a Bone Builders class before, you would be placed in a class and mentored by the current co-leaders prior to taking the training.   ","MoCo Rec Community Centers, MCPLs, City of Gaithersburg, Takoma Park","Locations Throughout County","MD","20850","ongoing",,,,"55-120","false",,,"Admin Support, Caregiving / Companion, Education / Mentoring, Health, Recreation / Sports",,,

The New Day Project is a farm-based approach to well-being. We host retreats, open houses and special events at Madison Fields, a 400-acre farm nestled in the Agricultural Reserve in Montgomery County. Interacting with the animals, enjoying the vistas, walking the trails and participating in seasonal activities help guests to slow down, to connect with nature and to enjoy themselves in gentle ways.
Many of our visitors are healthcare workers and emergency responders who are keeping us safe during this challenging time. Volunteering is a wonderful way to thank them for their care and concern.
Volunteer as a New Day AmbassadorNew Day Ambassadors ensure that visitors feel welcome and comfortable. As a New Day Ambassador, you will greet guests, answer questions and coordinate on-site programs with the Project Director and farm staff.Duties may include staging a room/porch/barn for events, setting up refreshments, helping with registration and parking, escorting visitors to various locations, assisting with seasonal activities, engaging with guests/speakers and keeping areas safe and clean.
At this time, we host groups of 10 people or less due to COVID-19 restrictions. Social distancing and masks are required at all times.

GETTING STARTED
As a food drive organizer, here’s a few steps to follow:


Practice good hygiene and social distancing in the handling of the donated food. We suggest asking for food to be bagged and then handling the bags with gloves.


Advertise your collection via email, NextDoor, Facebook, your neighborhood listserv – whatever works best for you. Let people know where and when they can donate. Then place clearly labeled boxes or bins in those locations.


Set a deadline for collections and remind people when it’s approaching. This will help motivate people to submit their donations. Challenges are also useful – offer a goal of a certain number of items, participants or pounds collected.


Take a picture! (if you want) We love to see the faces that help make all of this possible.


Drop-off your collections. Complete this Donation Form to get drop-off instructions. And thank you!


FOOD DRIVE FAQS


What’s the best time of year to host a food drive?Now! We are serving three times the amount of families than usual during COVID-19. Now more than ever, we need your help keeping our shelves stocked.


What if I receive a monetary donation during the drive?Fantastic! Try to collect the name and mailing address of those donors so we can send them a tax receipt for their contributions.

Hospital patients and staff will be heartened by your music and stories.  These activities are designed to be completed in the safety of your home during Quarantine for the time being (ending when MCPS and all MD/VA schools return to normal status). If you are interested in volunteering, please complete the following steps:

View the orientation video at our website: https://www.tacyfoundation.org/pages/about-us 
Complete (guardians only) and submit the waiver/release form attached to this opportunity or available on our website: https://www.tacyfoundation.org/pages/about-us
Attend one Orientation via telephone Conference Call.
Select one or more of the projects below to complete.
When an assignment is completed, send as an attachment in an email message to the Teen Intern, to the email address indicated on the attachment given to you for Orientation, and to Charlotte Holliday, at thetacyfoundation@gmail.com.  

Here is a list of many different virtual/remote opportunities that you can complete until schools return to normal status:
1.  Find music that has great meaning for the seniors (songs from 1940’s to 1990’s).  Use the time you would ordinarily spend practicing for an event to learn at least one or two songs. You will be ready to share these favorite songs when the doors open again. During this Fall season, add Fall and Winter repertoire to your list of music to bring after Quarantine. (1 SSL hour)
2.  Draw a picture depicting the Summer season for the seniors.  Include a crossword puzzle for them to keep their minds sharp. Write a rhyme and picture.  Reflect on their importance to your life by their great contributions through history (from 1940’s to the present).  Send these to the Teen Communications Intern for the Foundation. There have been many adventures from your generous, heroic efforts, and they are so beautiful to read.  Sharing your thoughts with other volunteers will embolden them to overcome their fear and hesitancy.  Sharing them with adults and seniors reminds the seniors that they are important.  It is their privilege to pass down to YOU the great work ethic, sense of purpose, and experiences in grappling with emergencies that they have learned during their lifetime.  During this silence from seeing them, we will ask the Communications Intern to receive these writings and place them on Facebook. Most seniors have access to Facebook.  They can see their young music friends’ messages of concern and of thanks for their lives.  We will also mail your messages to them either via email or USPS. (.5 SSL hour)
3.  Make and send your music video of music in public domain on YouTube performances. We will offer your music to the Activity Directors (of seniors facilities) as Virtual Live Performance.  You are allowed to speak clearly your message to seniors:  “I miss seeing you, so I would like to play this song for you now…..”. (1 SSL hour)
4. Write a thoughtful, encouraging email message to a senior.   Let the senior know how he or she has reminded you of courage and strength during hard times.
You may refer to the Beethoven story written and illustrated below by Faber Piano Adventures.  (See web site below on this email message.)
https://beethoven.pianoadventures.com/?mc_cid=fe4353e2fc&mc_eid=4e5fc455a7
Tell him or her that you are studying about another hero (besides the senior) who has helped you.  In other words, share with seniors in an email message to them to encourage them to be strong and to have hope.  
Send your letter to the Program Manager: programs.thetacyfoundation@gmail.com.  She will send your letter or story to the seniors in all of the places where we play music.  They will see our video playlist too and will look forward to the time when COVID is over and we will return to them. 
1.5 SSL per email letter.  5 full paragraphs of expressive, encouraging connection between the struggles of Beethoven’s life challenges and your experience so far in the pandemic of 2020.
5.  Write (and or) illustrate a particular memorable moment when you played music at a hospital.  Perhaps someone came up to you and thanked you.  Maybe a family had just heard a very sad prognosis, or a family was happily bringing home a newborn baby, or another family was bringing home a loved one from a hospital stay.  As they always do, they stopped to hear your music.  Another time, perhaps you saw people enter the lobby through the big doors and turn toward the music and sigh a deep breath of hope and courage.  Write a descriptive piece on this.  Your writing may bring peace of mind to someone in a senior facility or a hospital who cannot express the sadness or the despair.  Stories are the best medicine for reminding us of the inestimable value of paying forward our hope for others through music. (1 SSL hour)
6. Write about your Piano Pals® or Guitar Pals® or Reading Express® experiences. Your Reflections may be about a particular life lesson you gained in this setting.  Tell about how your Title 1 student saw the world through his or her eyes.  Your writing may reflect (1) a change in your idea of community service, (2) what you discovered that you did not know before you taught (Write about this in regard to the children whom you are serving), and/or (3) the importance of music in the lives of the children you are working with.  It may include a particularly difficult challenge that you faced or are facing in working with children. The piece may be about how you discovered a side of yourself you had not known before these music classes.  Relate how you would like to take what you learned into the world to share with others and to serve again. (1 SSL hour)
7.  Assemble USBs for shipments to NYC's First Responders as well as hospital patients.  Place USB into plastic pouches with inserts as a donation (1 SSL hour per 100 USBs)
8. Design GET WELL cards for patients.  When we ship USBs, we will place your card in the box to the hospital. You will need paper and paint/crayons/color pencils for this. Whatever art supplies you have are fine. Make these generic without reference of religious belief.  Hospitals request this.  (1 SSL hour for 15 cards)
   Design CHEERFUL THANK YOU cards for hospitals, First Responders, and the military families that will receive Tacy  Foundation USBs  at Fisher Houses, and First Responders. (1 SSL hour for 15 cards)
9.  The Reading Express Virtual Library:  Make a video recording of a children's book, a fairy tale, or Your Own Storybook of holidays in your family.  Show the pictures on the camera as you read the book.  No matter how difficult life becomes and how trapped a child feels, he or she can go anywhere in the universe with a book or story.  Reading to a child can take him anywhere, bring her hope and joy in any life situation. BE SURE THE STORY IS IN PUBLIC DOMAIN or contact the publisher directly first to receive written permission to make a video of the story.  (1 hour SSL)   
11.  Virtual Live Music via YouTube Video Concerts (in Virginia & Maryland) of  Music.  Prepare songs to play live on YouTube.  Chief Interns will place on a private playlist.  45-minute programs are to be sent to Seniors Facilities that request video to be viewed at any time that is convenient for each facility.  Look for Signup.com opportunities.  Prepare any classical and or public domain songs to cheer each listener!  1.5 hour SSL Credit.

We offer individualized tutoring to support students from PreK through 12th grade in math and reading.
We look for volunteers ages 16 and up interested in working one-on-one with students on Saturday mornings from 9:30 to 12pm in Silver Spring/Wheaton, MD area. LSF staff provides lesson plans and guidance, so all tutors have to bring is enthusiasm and dedication. We have permanent tutors, assigned to a student/s and expected to come every week, Back-up tutors who expect to come every week but not assigned to a student/s, and floaters who we call on only when we need extra tutors (which is most weeks).
All tutors, new and returning, must complete our LSF 2022-2023 Tutor Training Form. The form contains MANDATORY training in Khan Academy, ReadWorks, Native Language Literacy initiative, as well as Early Literacy Initiative training for those working with students in PreK through 2rd grade. This Fall, we will be using several programs during our tutoring sessions, including Khan Academy, ReadWorks, and Duolingo or Quizlet. Students and tutors should be using these materials during the tutoring session, so it’s important that you understand how to use all of the programs. You will need to complete the form by answering a questionnaire, watching the training videos, and completing a brief quiz. If you are planning to work with a student between the grades of PreK through 2rd grade, the entire form will take about two hours to complete due to the Early Literacy Initiative component. If you would prefer to work with a student in 3th grade or above, the form will take about an hour to complete. 















 
Please watch ALL the training videos in their entirety. Many things have changed, even if you tutored with us virtually this Summer, so it is crucial you watch all of the videos and have a deep understanding of how our tutoring sessions will be conducted this Fall. If you would like to watch the videos before beginning the form, to save time, you can access the videos here on our LSF Tutor Resource Padlet. 
 
Here is the LSF 2022-2023 Tutor Training Form 
 
We will contact you if any of the comprehension questions are incorrect so that you can revisit the training. In order to be paired with a student, please complete the form by the end of the day on Tuesday, September 13. If you miss this deadline, you will be added to our floater/substitute tutor “pool” and can still join us each Saturday. Please sign up for an orientation session at Latino Student Fund Givepulse Page.
 
Please share this information with others that may be interested in tutoring with us.

As a part of the crime prevention initiatives established by the State’s Attorney’s Office in Montgomery County, the Truancy Prevention Program works to improve the attendance of middle school children in Montgomery County Public schools by discovering the root causes of truancy and assisting students and their families with issues that impact attendance.  The program confronts school absenteeism by addressing academic, school, personal, and family-related factors.  The Truancy Prevention Program is a voluntary and supportive program designed to keep children in school and families out of court.  Each school year, approximately 60 percent of students show significant improvements in attendance and overall school success.  During the Summer students will be invited to join the Summer Academy where they will learn and experience various opportunities in Montgomery County and create outreach products for the program.
The mentorship positions are open at various MCPS partner schools for the fall and spring. 
We are always open to connecting with anyone interested in joining our efforts.
Commitment: 
Volunteer Mentors are needed to work one 3-hour session a week at an MCPS school for 11 weeks starting on Oct 17-Jan 20, with the exception of Thanksgiving week and Christmas/New Year’s week.
Sessions are held from either 9am-12pm, or 12pm-3pm Monday-Thursday. Mentors must be 18 years or older to participate and able to commit to one session a week for 11 weeks, plus a 3-hour orientation session. Due to Covid-19, volunteers will be required to follow MCPS protocols for staff, which at this time includes proof of Covid-19 Vaccination or be subject to testing, and wearing masks in schools where required.

We understand that making a full 24 week commitment can be difficult; for this reason each route will also have a pool of back up drivers so volunteers can have some flexibility as needed.
In the past, volunteers have enjoyed this opportunity since it is a way for people to make a direct difference in people's lives; also, there are opportunities to connect with the families and the farmers since you would serve the same families from the same farm each week. Supporting our local small scale vegetable farms is another important part of our mission, so in this way, you too will be part of helping to build up a resilient local food system!

We are seeking volunteers to participate in our virtual pre-employment seminar series by providing a 90 minute weekly presentation of Health & Hygiene, Dress for Success, Informational Interviews or Mock Interviews as well as Motivational talks, Exercises activities, Musical Concerts,  Virtual tours, cooking sessions, and any other interesting virtual event.

Many of our programs rely on the continual support of volunteers to provide meals for our clients at our various locations. Currently, three of our locations are in need of meal providers. The details are below:
 
Becky's House Residence for Senior Women in Rockville is home to 8 elderly women who were previously homeless. Volunteers are welcome to come and prepare a meal at the home any evening of the week and serve lunch/dinner to the ladies as well as mingle with them. Volunteers provide food to be prepared on site arriving early enough to allot time to cook. The women enjoy visitors, especially those who cook a well-balanced meal! Dinner is served between 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm. Volunteers are also welcome to do breakfast, brunch and cookouts!
Priscilla's House Residence for Women in Gaithersburg is home to 8 women who were previously homeless. Volunteers are welcome to come and prepare a meal on site or drop off a meal any afternoon/evening of the week. Volunteers provide food to be prepared on site arriving early enough to allot time to cook. Just like the ladies at Becky's House, they also enjoy visitors and we welcome volunteers to stay and mingle with the ladies. Dinner is served between 5:30 pm and 6:30 p.m.
Interfaith Works Women's Center in Rockville serves up to 70 women. As a meal provider, your duties would include preparing a large enough meal off site and bringing it to the shelter to serve the women for dinner. Meal providers typically serve for one week and also provide lunches (bagged lunch with a sandwich, drink and snack) and breakfast items in addition to the dinner meal. The breakfast and lunch meals are dropped off in advance and not served by volunteers to the residents.
Providing meals to homeless individuals makes a great impact on their life by helping them stave off hunger which would otherwise not be avoided if they were forced to rely on their own limited resources to acquire food. Every volunteer is required to complete an application and a brief interview prior to being assigned to this opportunity.

These dogs are eventually placed as mobility service dogs, family support dogs or therapy dogs for Wounded Warriors. It is seeking volunteers to serve as Puppy Parents for future service dogs in training.
For the duration of their training, WCC pups live in Puppy Parent homes. In addition to any training the dogs do with Warriors, they are constantly working on their skills in a home environment and at training sessions at WCC and are taken on weekly outings to public places where they learn to use their training in real-life situations.
Puppy Parents raise our service dogs for approximately two years before the dogs graduate and are placed with a forever Veteran. Each puppy goes home with his or her Puppy Parent between the ages of 8-12 weeks. To be considered for this important task, you must be willing and able to provide the following support and training for the WCC service dog in training:

Provide a stable, safe, consistent and loving environment
Provide the dog with access to new places, new people and new experiences
Supervise the dog throughout the day
Teach the dog manners and basic commands
Keep the dog on a leash at all times or supervised in a securely fenced area
Closely monitor the dog’s progress and submit monthly reports
Attend weekly training classes, including social outings that build skills and confidence
Provide the dog with age-appropriate socialization opportunities
Ensure that the WCC dog is the only dog under the age of one in your home
Agree to return the dog upon request
Transport the dog to the veterinarian when necessary
Depending on program location, you may be required to drop off/pick up the dog at the training office during the workweek.*Some locations require the puppy parent to take the service dog in training to work.

Groups will appoint a team leader to oversee projects, work with Button Farm staff, and coordinate volunteers. Adults are responsible for providing appropriate supervision for children serving in their groups. NOTE: Groups with less than 8 participants should check out our individual opportunities listings.
To coordinate your group project, please contact our Volunteer Coordinator at menarevolunteer@gmail.com.

RefAmerica is a program in leadership, public-speaking, cross-cultural understanding, and the narrative method.  Participants have the opportunity to get to know Washington DC; to learn more about American immigrant stories; to engage in a unique cross-cultural program of sharing traditions, team-building experiences, and personal stories; to explore their own roles within a greater American story of immigration and integration; and to plan ways to welcome refugees and promote cross-cultural understanding in their home communities.  Participants visit key Washington sites and share their stories at speaking events, in meetings with government, think tank, and international organization representatives, and on Capitol Hill.  The goal of RefAmerica is to promote full inclusion of recently arrived refugees in America and provide small groups of participant refugees with the tools both to tell their stories and to help forge for themselves, their families and their fellow refugees, like generations of Americans before them, a new American story.  We rely also on the power of personal narrative to help foster a warm American welcome for refugees.
