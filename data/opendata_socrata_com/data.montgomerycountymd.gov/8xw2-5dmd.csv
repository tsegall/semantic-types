2020,P150401,Wheaton Redevelopment Program,"This project provides for the planning, studies, design, and construction of an office building, public parking garage, and a town square on the site of Parking Lot 13 and the Mid-County Regional Services Center (RSC) in Wheaton. The project components include 1) an approximately 308,100 square feet (s.f.) office building to be owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC); 2) an approximately 400 space underground public parking garage to be delivered to the Wheaton Parking Lot District (PLD); and 3) a town square located on Lot 13 and the current RSC site. The new headquarters for M-NCPPC will occupy approximately 132,000 s.f. of the building, including space for a child care facility. The remainder of the building space will be used by the County for office and retail under a long-term lease agreement. The County intends to use its space for nearly 12,000 s.f. of street front retail space and move offices of the RSC, Wheaton Urban District, Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Department of Permitting Services (DPS), Department of Recreation, the Community Use of Public Facilities, and Environmental Health Regulatory Services in the Department of Health and Human Services to this building. The building will have a geothermal heating and cooling system which is likely to result in LEED Platinum certification for the office building. After the building is delivered to M-NCPPC, the Commission will transfer the ownership of the parcels at 8787 Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring and 11200 Amherst Avenue in Wheaton to the County. The County will then transfer 8787 Georgia Avenue to the developer who will develop a privately financed mixed-use project on the site. The delivery will include air rights above the land over the parking garage for the space comprising the office building and over that portion of the land located between the building and Reedie Drive. The Town Square will be maintained and programmed by the RSC for community benefit. Publicly available WiFi will be among those community benefits. The obligations and relationship between County Government and M-NCPPC for the project are reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding dated May 31, 2013 and will be explicitly set forth in the Binding Agreements between the parties. This PDF also includes $650,000 for consulting services to provide 1) a comprehensive parking study to identify potential redevelopment disruptions to the public parking supply and any related impacts of existing businesses and to identify potential mitigation options; 2) planning studies to review potential models and approaches to creating local jobs and job training opportunities prior to and during redevelopment, including relevant case examples in Montgomery County as well as innovative models from other local and national jurisdictions; and 3) a business assessment study to determine the number of businesses and the magnitude of the impact. The business assessment study is needed to support Council Bill 6-12 for the establishment of service provision and technical assistance to those small businesses adversely impacted by a County redevelopment project.","Montgomery County Public Parking Lot 13, between Grandview Avenue and Triangle Lane; the RSC site on Reedie Drive, Wheaton; 8787 Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring; and Veterans Urban Park at 11200 Amherst Avenue, Wheaton, Maryland.",Under Construction,1,https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/wheatondev/,39.039831,-77.055256,4,"(39.039831, -77.055256)",1,17,16,4,1,4
2020,P150700,Long Branch Town Center Redevelopment,"This project provides for planning needed to support redevelopment in the Long Branch Sector Plan area. The construction of the Purple Line will influence the development potential of the sector plan area on both a short- and long-term basis. Two Purple Line stations are planned in Long Branch - one on Arliss Street, just to the north of Piney Branch Road, and the other on University Boulevard, just south of its intersection with Piney Branch Road. The County will coordinate through a multi-departmental approach that will include the Office of County Executive, Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Community Affairs and the Silver Spring Regional Service Center. Activities will also be planned in partnership with the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), property owners and businesses in this sector plan area with input from the surrounding community. The State will have the primary responsibility for coordinating efforts to mitigate impacts of the Purple Line in Long Branch. As such, efforts are needed to help ensure that the multitude of businesses in Long Branch can prosper during the construction of the Purple Line, and just as importantly, after it is operational. In order to minimize any disruption that may affect the Long Branch business community, a multi-prong approach will be implemented through: 1) marketing assistance that highlights the availability and presence of existing businesses during construction; 2) training, available to all businesses along the Purple Line, that will focus on adjusting to a new marketplace and developing business opportunities during construction; 3) signage that will direct patrons to shops, restaurants and available parking; and 4) technical assistance designed to strengthen existing companies. This strategy is consistent with the Purple Line Corridor Community Development Agreement's goal to help locally established businesses prosper both during and after the construction period and to minimize disruptions during construction.","In the vicinity of the Long Branch Sector Plan area, including Bonifant Street, Silver Spring, Maryland.",Planning Stage,1,,38.998657,-77.027405,5,"(38.998657, -77.027405)",1,3065,7,5,1,1

Major new IT systems that have been completed through this project include the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Financial and Human Resources modules, foundation phase of the 311/Constituent Relationship Management (CRM), Electronic Time reporting (MCTime), and related Business Process Review (BPR). Planning activities for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) technology modernization of key systems and processes are underway. The Budgeting module of the ERP system (Hyperion) and additional self-service functionality is currently underway and the workforce component of the Hyperion System has been completed. The ERP project was implemented to modernize Core Business Systems to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and responsiveness of the County Government. In addition, modernization of the County's Tax Assessment Billing System is underway. This system is used to annually calculate and bill County residents for County and municipal property taxes, solid waste fees, water quality fees, Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) fees, and other fees, taxes, and related credits. The HHS program provides for the development and implementation of an Enterprise Integrated Case Management (EICM) system as part of a larger Process and Technology Modernization (PTM) program that will move the department from a traditional agency-centric model of practice to a more effective client-centered model of practice. As part of this initiative, the EICM project will upgrade obsolete IT systems and information processes to avoid duplication of data entry, reduce ineffective coordination of services, and minimize inefficiencies resulting from legacy systems. The Active Network (ActiveNet) upgrade for the Department of Recreation, Community Use of Public Facilities (CUPF), and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning (M-NCPPC) involves the replacement of the existing CLASS registration and payment system.

2020,P316222,ALARF: MCG,"The Advance Land Acquisition Revolving Fund (ALARF) was established to support the implementation of capital project and facility programs in the County. Acquisition of land in advance of actual construction saves money in the face of rising land prices and enables suitable locations for libraries, fire stations, and similar facilities to be secured before development eliminates choice and forces acceptance of a less accessible or desirable site. The revolving fund works in the following way: the unencumbered revolving appropriation balance in the fund is used to purchase land for various public facilities which are either approved in the capital program or which appear in adopted area master plans. Later, the Fund is reimbursed by appropriations to the specific facility project accounts; then, the associated expenditures are transferred from the ALARF project to the facility project, thereby freeing up the appropriation for future expenditures. The reimbursement is desirable for accounting purposes in order to make the cost of the site clearly a part of the total cost of a specific project. Reimbursement also maintains the balance in the revolving fund. A number of such reimbursements are scheduled in this capital program. Cost estimates are not given for possible acquisitions since any estimates would be speculative. Immediately prior to initiating acquisition proceedings on any site, independent professional appraisals are prepared. When projected land costs appear to be considerably greater than anticipated, consultation with the County Council is useful. In the event the County Executive proceeds with advance land acquisition in years before those shown on project description forms, consultation with Council would be useful. The cumulative appropriation is the amount of the revolving fund, as well as certain special appropriations to this project as described below. Costs shown for prior years include the land acquisition reimbursable to the fund and other charges incurred in site selection, such as appraisal, legal costs, and other required actions. Also displayed are expenditures associated with special appropriations, not to be reimbursed. The nonreimbursable amounts are considered sunk costs. Expenditures portrayed above in FY19-24 are for fiscal planning purposes only and represent land acquisition not shown on applicable individual CIP project description forms in order to preserve confidentiality of estimates and negotiations with landowners. ALARF acquisitions are typically reimbursed by appropriations from projects with various revenue sources.",,Ongoing,1,,,,NULL,,,,,,,
2020,P319485,Technology Investment Loan Fund,"This project establishes an inter-agency loan fund to support, in whole or in part, Technology Investment Fund (TIF) projects.  The purpose of this fund is to encourage technologically innovative capital projects that will improve the productivity of County agencies.  Projects approved for funding will use innovative technologies to achieve cost reductions, cost avoidance, or service improvements.  The loan fund allows agencies to acquire capital for such investments to be repaid to the loan fund from savings achieved according to specified repayment schedules.  The County Executive appoints, and the County Council approves, the Technology Investment Fund Loan/Grant Committee composed of representatives of each of the agencies and an independent representative not affiliated with any of the tax supported agencies or potential technology service providers.  This committee reviews applications from departments and agencies, according to policy guidelines and criteria established by the County Executive and the County Council.  A share of loan fund money is reserved for access by small organizational units and for projects accompanied by department matching resources or outside funding.  Each agency may decide which applications to submit to the TIF Loan/Grant Committee, including previously submitted applications or new applications.  The TIF Loan/Grant Committee reviews applications with appropriate technical advice from the Department of Technology Services (DTS) and other relevant experts.  Each agency has an equal vote in committee decisions. The TIF Loan/Grant Committee makes recommendations for awards to specific projects to the County Executive for final decision.  Approved projects are assigned an individual PDF funded from current revenues which include the amount of the loan fund used for that particular project and a schedule for repayment.  Management of the loan fund is subject to regular evaluation and oversight by the County Executive and County Council.

IJIS will simplify the steps for users to access data such as warrant and criminal background checks, while maintaining proper security and automatically exchanging data between appropriate agencies and systems. IJIS will be designed, implemented, and maintained to provide timely and appropriate data to field personnel in a clear and effective manner. Most field personnel will log on via a secure web site and view a simple menu of reports to access the data appropriate to their job function (e.g., a criminal background check on prisoners about to be released). IJIS will also be capable of routing data and/or warnings to the appropriate systems and personnel when certain events occur (e.g., if a person in the custody of the County is listed on a warrant from another jurisdiction). IJIS will link different data systems that are required to exchange data (e.g., arrest data between the Police department, the State of Maryland, the Courts, the Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation). The implementation of the Food Services and Time Scheduling modules of the Corrections and Rehabilitation Information Management System (CRIMS) will provide for an integrated Food Services solution allowing the easy identification of offenders requiring specialized diets based on, for example, medical needs.

Individual projects range from retrofitting existing storm drainage systems to developing new drainage systems required to upgrade the existing systems in older subdivisions. Projects formerly handled through the Neighborhood Storm Drain Improvements Project are usually small, unanticipated projects initiated by requests from citizens whose homes and properties are subject to severe flooding or erosion and where there is a demonstrated need for early relief. Potential new storm drain projects are studied under the Facility Planning: Storm Drain project. Concept studies are evaluated based on the following factors: public safety, damage to private property and frequency of event, damage to public right-of-way, environmental factors such as erosion, general public benefit, availability of right-of-way and 5:1 cost benefit damage prevented ratio. After the completion of facility planning, projects with construction estimated to cost less than $500,000 are included in this project. Prompt relief is frequently achieved by the use of Department of Transportation (DOT) personnel to construct and provide construction management. The project also facilitates financial participation with developers up to 50 percent share of construction cost for storm drainage projects where such construction would yield a public benefit to properties other than that of homeowner or developers.

This project includes expenditures for the preliminary and final design and land acquisition for storm drain projects prior to inclusion in the Storm Drain General project, or as a stand-alone project in the Capital Improvements Program (CIP). Prior to its inclusion in the CIP, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will conduct a feasibility study to determine the general and specific features required for the project. Candidate projects currently are evaluated from the Drainage Assistance Request list. As part of the facility planning process, DOT considers citizen and public agency requests and undertakes a comprehensive analysis of storm drainage issues and problems being experienced in the County. This analysis is used to select areas where a comprehensive long-term plan for the remediation of a problem may be required. No construction activities are performed in this project. When a design is 35 percent complete, an evaluation is performed to determine if right-of-way is needed. Based on the need for right-of-way, the project may proceed to final design and the preparation of right-of-way plats under this project. The cost of right-of-way acquisition will be charged to the Advanced Land Acquisition Revolving Fund (ALARF).

Funds included in this project will allow MCPS to more fully integrate outdoor play areas into maintenance practices and create solutions when individual schools present challenges to a conventional approach. An amendment to the Board of Education's Requested FY 2018 Capital Budget and Amendments to the FY 2017-2022 Capital Improvements Program was approved to develop this pilot program to evaluate the outdoor program/play areas of MCPS schools, establish improved maintenance practices for these sites, and identify potential solutions to provide adequate and appropriate outdoor program/play areas, particularly at elementary schools with severely compromised sites. Also, the approved funds will address the outdoor program/play areas of four to six schools identified through the initial review of schools. It is anticipated that this pilot program will transform into a level of effort project to address this ongoing need. An FY 2019 appropriation was approved to continue this pilot program to address outdoor program/play areas for schools with site constraints and limitations due to school overutilization.

2020,P651913,Major Capital Projects,"<p>A major effort as part of the CIP process has been to review the revitalization/expansion program to develop a multi-variable approach to determine the relative priority of large-scale renovations, possibly including programmatic and capacity considerations. As an evaluation of the previous process is reviewed and factors that could be used in a new process are considered, it is evident that the need for flexibility with respect to these major capital projects is imperative, as is the need to include instructional program priorities and the impact of overutilization. This new approach will eliminate the static and lengthy project queue that has been in place for many years. <br>In order to consider this new approach, the Board of Education must conduct a formal review process with respect to the two primary policies that guide the long-range educational facility planning framework. This review will allow for community engagement through formal public comments on the two policies. Therefore, at this point, the Board of Education, as part of the FY 2019-2024 CIP, has included funds in this project intended to create fiscal capacity in the CIP for these major capital projects and it is anticipated that future projects will be programmed using the expenditures shown in this project through the revised analysis and capital planning processes, once the Board of Education has completed its policy work. </p><p>As part of the amended FY 2019-2024 CIP, the Board of Education identified the following schools to begin the planning process as part of the Major Capital Projects: Burnt Mills, South Lake, Stonegate, and Woodlin elementary schools; Neelsville Middle School; and Damascus, Col. Zadok Magruder, Poolesville, and Thomas S. Wootton high schools. Therefore, an FY 2020 appropriation is requested to begin planning for the schools identified above.

The County Agricultural Easement Program (AEP) enables the County to purchase preservation easements on farmland in the agricultural zones and in other zones approved by the County Council to preserve farmland not entirely protected by Transferable Development Rights (TDR) easements or State agricultural land preservation easements. The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) enables the State to purchase preservation easements on farmland jointly by the County and State. The Rural Legacy Program (RLP) enables the State to purchase conservation easements to preserve large contiguous tracts of agricultural land. The sale of development rights easements are proffered voluntarily by the farmland owner. The project receives funding from the Agricultural Transfer Tax, which is levied when farmland is sold and removed from agricultural status. Montgomery County is a State-certified county under the provisions of State legislation, which enables the County to retain 75 percent of the taxes for local use. The County uses a portion of its share of the tax to provide matching funds for State easements. In FY10, the Building Lot Termination (BLT) program was initiated. This program represents an enhanced farmland preservation program tool to further protect land where development rights have been retained in the Agricultural Reserve-AR zone.

While MCPS provides program accessibility in a manner consistent with current laws, a significant number of existing facilities not scheduled for modernization in the current six-year CIP are at least partially inaccessible for a variety of disabling conditions. Some combination of elevators, wheelchair lifts, restroom modifications, and other site-specific improvements are required at many of these facilities. Since disabilities of eligible individuals must be considered on a case-by-case basis, additional modifications such as automatic door openers, access ramps, and curb cuts may be required on an ad hoc basis even in facilities previously considered accessible. The increased mainstreaming of special education students has contributed to modifications to existing facilities. Certain ADA modifications results in significant cost avoidance, since transportation may have to be provided for individuals to other venues or programs. On September 15, 2010, the Department of Justice approved revisions to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), that will require local and state government agencies to comply with theses revisions.

This project is reviewed by the interagency committee for capital programs that affect other county agencies to develop the most cost effective method to comply with state regulation. This project also will address pollution prevention measures that were formally addressed in the County Water Quality PDF. Federal and State laws require MCPS to upgrade and maintain stormwater pollution prevention measures at schools and support facilities. The State of Maryland, Department of the Environment, through the renewal of Montgomery County's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, has included MCPS as a co-permitee under its revised current Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System MS4 permit, subject to certain pollution prevention regulations and reporting requirements not required in the past. As a co-permittee, MCPS will be required to develop a system-wide plan for complying with MS4 permit requirements. The plan could include infrastructure improvements that reduce the potential for pollution to enter into the stormwater system and area streams. A portion of the plan also will include surveying and documenting, in a GIS mapping system, the stormwater systems at various facilities.

Executive Boulevard Extended East (B-7)-Rockville Pike/MD 355 to a New Private Street - construct 1,100 feet of four-lane roadway. 2. Executive Boulevard Extended East (B-7)-New Private Street  to new Nebel Street Extended  - construct 600 feet of four-lane roadway. 3. Nebel Street (B-5)-Nicholson Lane South to a Combined Property site - construct 1,200 feet of four-lane roadway. 4. Bridge across Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) tracks adjacent to White Flint Metro Station – on future MacGrath Boulevard between MD 355 and future Station Street - construct 80-foot-long three-lane bridge.  All the roadway segments will be designed in FY14 - FY18. Various improvements to the roads will include new traffic lanes, shared-use paths, the undergrounding of overhead utility lines where required, other utility relocations, and streetscaping. These projects will become stand-alone projects once engineering is complete and final construction costs can be accurately determined.

2019,P340700,Voice Mail System Replacement,"The Voice Mail System Replacement project will ensure the telecommunications infrastructure remains a reliable and viable system which is essential to all county employees and citizens. The project provides for upgrading to the S8710 PBX platform with Communications Manager Release 3.0, which will give the County significant new business continuity and survivability capabilities. An upgrade to modular messaging voicemail will allow the County to replace an end-of-life system that has limited ability to add new voicemail boxes with one where messages can be retrieved via phone or computer - either through web browser or as part of the County's Exchange system and allow for creation of additional voicemail boxes for new employees. This will enable workers to more quickly respond to messages, even when working remotely. It will also be possible to add optional capabilities in the system that offer the ability to speech enable email, facsimile, calendar, and calling features. The Modular Messaging voice mail system can integrate with Outlook Exchange, as well as Web browsing technology, which enables the County to further leverage converged network components. Converged network components translate into lower capital expenses and lower management cost. These features are particularly valuable in highly congested areas, because they allow workers to retrieve and respond to important emails during long commutes. Similarly, County citizens depend on the same infrastructure and telephone applications to access County employees and/or systems for information necessary to meet their needs. This voice mail system replacement project upgrade will keep the PBX platform in a healthy, evolutionary upgrade mode, which will prevent the need for an expensive replacement in the future.",,Under Construction                                ,1,,,,,,,,,,,

2019,P091901,Reimburse HOC for Underground Utilities Infrastructure for 900 Thayer,"The Housing Opportunities Commission of Montgomery County (HOC) purchased the 900 Thayer property from a private, market rate developer with the Site Plan already approved. The Site Plan approval for 900 Thayer as a market rate rental community included, as a requirement, the implementation of approximately $3,000,000 in offsite infrastructure improvements. The improvements include sidewalk replacement and upgrade, utility burial, street lighting relocation, and general streetscape improvements. All of these improvements are to the public thoroughfare - both sidewalks and streets. These offsite improvements extend to the west on Thayer Avenue beyond three neighboring properties, north on Fenton Street - 200 feet beyond Thayer's southern boundary, including fully improving the sidewalk in front of the neighboring County parking lot. HOC purchased 900 Thayer already entitled as a way of delivering subsidized, family housing to downtown Silver Spring nearly two years faster than if HOC had begun a new development application on a similar site. Had 900 Thayer been an affordable housing project from its initial application to Planning, it is highly likely that the scope of offsite improvements would have been dramatically reduced. The reduced scope of improvements would have left nearly all of the currently required improvements to the County in the future. An amendment to the approved Site Plan would remove these requirements given the new public benefit provided by HOC's plan and would have added significant delay to the start of construction of 900 Thayer (which is expected to begin in October 2017) and upset the surrounding community members who are now justifiably expecting these improvements. These streetscape improvements are not directly supportive of 900 Thayer, and 900 Thayer could be built and operated as designed without nearly any of the offsite improvements. These improvements do improve sidewalk accessibility, pedestrian safety, and aesthetic beauty within the public thoroughfare - all of which are public benefits that HOC, of course, supports. However, the cost of these improvements adds 10% to the construction costs of a new building that will be two-thirds deeply affordable. Because these costs are physical infrastructure costs related to the County's public thoroughfare and not to inducing affordability, HOC is making this request of the Capital Improvement Program as opposed to the Housing Initiative Fund.",,Planning Stage                                    ,1,,,,5,,,,,,,

2019,P091902,Predevelopment Funds for HOC Office Headquarters,"The headquarters location of the Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC) of Montgomery County is 10400 Detrick Avenue in Kensington (the Kensington Office), inside a former elementary school. HOC has occupied this space since 1983, subject to a lease agreement pursuant to which nominal lease payments are required. The Kensington Office is an adaptive reuse of a former school building which was constructed in 1955. Consequently, there are a number of deficiencies, most of which cannot be easily cured. These include, but are not limited to, physical obsolescence of the building and some of its systems, inefficient layout that would be available in a purpose built office building, and the inability to comply with requirements of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA). The Kensington Office is also inconveniently located making client access a challenge for those who rely on public transportation. Further, Montgomery County Public School (MCPS), which has an option on the site, is currently working to identify properties that could be brought back into service to meet the growing population educational needs. In the event 10400 Detrick became available, MCPS would likely identify the location as one of these properties. To effectively carry out its business of delivering affordable housing to persons of eligible income, the Commission requires appropriate administrative office space from which to conduct business. Staff estimates that HOC requires approximately 50,000 square feet of office space for its operations, and it anticipates consolidating the Silver Spring Service Center at a new headquarters site, bringing the estimated requirement to approximately 65,000 square feet of space. Relocating service center operations to a new building would both reduce future costs of HOC operations and more conveniently serve HOC clients. Therefore, staff proposes the submission of a request for $2,500,000 from the Montgomery County Capital Improvements Plan for FY19. If approved, the funds will be used to conduct a search for suitable office space for HOC and to conduct third party studies to construct a new HOC office building or to procure, renovate, and retrofit an existing building.",,Planning Stage                                    ,1,,,,,,,,,,,
