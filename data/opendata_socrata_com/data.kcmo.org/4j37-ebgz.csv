Established in 2008, la Esquina (the corner in Spanish) was named to honor the Westside neighborhood's historically Latino population, comprising nearly 50% of neighborhood residents. In 2016, the 2,500 square foot white-box gallery space hosted 26 exhibitions, performances, tours, public programs, and artist-gatherings, attracting more than 3,500 attendees. In 2018-2019, la Esquina will be programmed through three primary strategies: Open Call, Curator-in-Residence, and CSF Studio Residency; each designed to reflect Kansas City's range of creative and artistic excellence and to attract a cross-section of local, regional, and out-of-region visitors.OPEN CALL: CSF provides opportunities for Kansas City-area curators, visual artists and performance-based artists to propose projects for la Esquina gallery. Through a competitive process, artists and curators are selected to receive a block of time in the space, a project stipend, marketing support, and production and technical assistance. Open Call offers curators and artists of all disciplines a chance to present work in a prominent arts venue, gain experiences that will enhance their curatorial or programmatic outlook, and attract new opportunities within and beyond the region.CURATOR-IN-RESIDENCE: CSFs unique curatorial residency program is designed to immerse exceptional emerging national curators in Kansas City for 18 months to connect with, guide, and enhance the work of regional artists, aiming to elevating Kansas Citys national profile as a hub for exceptional artistic practice. This residency attracts young curators emerging on the national arts scene, and temporarily embeds them in Kansas Citys artistic community. Past CIRs have gone on to work for high-profile art museums, galleries, and arts organizations, becoming ambassadors for Kansas City artists across the US. The 2018-2019 CIR will curate 2 original exhibitions during the grant period, highlighting a mix of national and Kansas City-based artists.

We cultivate the contemporary, the exceptional, and the unexpected in the practice of artists working in and engaging with the Kansas City art community.Founded in 1997, Charlotte Street Foundation (CSF) supports and recognizes outstanding artists in Kansas City; promotes, enhances, and encourages the visual, performing, literary and interdisciplinary arts; and fosters community development in the greater Kansas City region. Through innovation and responsiveness to the real needs expressed by Kansas Citys community of artists, Charlotte Street has established itself as a nationally recognized model for supporting artists, contributing significantly to the development of the local arts community, and advocating for the important cultural and economic impact of local artists and grassroots arts activity. Through financially supporting, presenting, and promoting the work of contemporary Kansas City area artists, Charlotte Street has enhanced Kansas City's vitality as a regional center for contemporary art. During 2018-2019, Charlotte Street will continue to offer key programming that has made the organization an innovative leader in support of individual artists including: 1. Awards & Grants: Five unrestricted cash awards and two travel grants will be given to Kansas City artists as chosen by an esteemed panel of jurors. Through Andy Warhol's re-granting program, Charlotte street administers 6-8 grants each year for progressive, innovative, public facing art projects and commissions.3. Artist & Curatorial Residencies: Providing free studio and exhibition space for 80+ artists every year including mentoring and professional development. Supporting an 18-month curatorial residency program connecting local artists with national artists in discussions and exhibitions.4. Exhibition & Public Programs: Providing opportunities for local artists and curators to propose projects including exhibitions, performances and other events through a competitive selection process. Other public programs include the Artists' Walks at the Nelson Atkins Museum of art and MoBank Artboards . Partnership Programming: Charlotte Street partners with Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, H & R Block Artspace and the Folly Theater to attract new programming and recognition for individual artists in Kansas City & for our artist community. NEW IN 2018, CSF will offer an increased emphasis on community-oriented programming, with a focus on neighborhood outreach in two key neighborhoods of Kansas City, Missouri.","Charlotte Street Foundation will distribute printed cards and programs to hotels, tourist destinations in the downtown area, and information centers such as Union Station. Thanks to CSF's strong network of programming partners across Kansas City, the organization frequently partners to cross-promote events and exhibitions. Additionally, Charlotte Street Foundation participated in the development of the ArtsKC Go calendar as a beta user and early adopter, supporting the development of an easy-to-use tool for residents and out-of-town visitors alike, offering a robust sampling of cultural arts opportunities, and clear and easy access to event schedules, tickets, and information. Charlotte Street regularly participates and partners with national art associations and other Kansas City arts organizations to support and present conferences and conventions such as the 2016 NCECA conference, the 2017 International Sculpture Conference, and the (forthcoming) 2018 Open Spaces project.","In 2018-2019, CSF seeks to increase our engagement with the Westside neighborhood as we develop our programs and perform more outreach. This more community-engaged programming model was initiated in 2016 and 2017 with a few programs that were either culturally relevant to the heavily Latino population of the neighborhood such as the Curator-in-Residence exhibition ""Que Pasa, USA?"" and the establishment of Kansas City's Persons of Color artist coalition. Additionally, CSF made significant efforts to attract Westside residents and business owners to This Thing of Ours, a family-friendly hip-hop/breakdancing showcase. In 2018-2019, we plan to produce marketing materials in Spanish as well as English, to be distributed at Westside shops and restaurants, among residences, and to neighborhood-based nonprofits including frequent programming partner Mattie Rhodes Arts Center, our adjacent neighbors at the Westside Housing Organization, as well as the Westside Community Action Network.","Charlotte Street's la Esquina gallery has already proven to be a significant attraction to visitors traveling to Kansas City for arts and culture. As detailed below, more than half of 2016 visitors to la Esquina traveled from outside the region to participate in cultural activities in Kansas City, underscoring a recently released report by Americans for the Arts, which indicated that 81% of tourists who attended an arts or cultural event traveled to Kansas City traveled for that specific purpose. In 2018, as a confederation of arts and civic organizations work in partnership with the City of Kansas City, Missouri, to attract national and international festival-goers to a major contemporary art fair, Charlotte Street Foundation is certain to attract hundreds if not thousands of attendees to visit its exhibitions and attend programming featuring Kansas City's most cutting edge contemporary artists. As a result, these audiences will gain the experience of Kansas City's cultural richness and diversity by exploring the Westside neighborhood. Additionally, la Esquina's proximity to the Kansas City Convention Center, as well as a number of burgeoning nearby tourist destinations (including Boulevard Brewing Co. and The Roasterie), are converging to make the Westside neighborhood a convenient and attractive tourist destination that retains its authenticity, but welcomes newcomers and visitors.","Belief in the power of the artist is at the core of Charlotte Street Foundation. Over the past 20 years, as opportunities have arisen and resources available, Charlotte Street has constructed an interlocking array of programs and services that respond to the needs of local artists: spaces and resources for creating and presenting their work; opportunities for convening, collaborating, networking and community building;professional development and mentorship; platforms for critical dialogue, exposure and feedback; and opportunities to reach and connect with new audiences and patrons. By providing opportunities for artists to develop work, explore ideas and methods, experiment and take risks, gain exposure and expand their networks, and increase their professional acumen, they are able to reach new audiences, improve the sustainability of their careers, and contribute to the large cultural dynamic that makes Kansas City unique. No other Kansas City arts organization provides this unique mix of programs designed specifically for contemporary artists to develop individually and collectively, and to help artists build sustainable careers.The artistic excellence and unique quality of Charlotte Street's programming has established the organization as a national model, and developed a tremendously committed audience and support network within Kansas City. Throughout 2017, Charlotte Street connected and engaged across the city in celebration of its 20th anniversary, building partnerships with nearly 20 organizations including the Kansas City Public Library, the Blue Room at the American Jazz Museum, the Kansas City Museum, H&R Block Artspace, the Nerman Museum, Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas, and more. Through this strategic effort to broaden audiences and increase awareness of CSF's programming, the organization is likely connect with tens of thousands of new audience members by the end of 2017. We anticipate that these new relationships and heightened public awareness will equate to greater participation and attendance at CSF exhibitions, programs, and collaborations in 2018 and beyond.","Charlotte Street's la Esquina programming attracts thousands of Kansas Citians and tourists to Kansas City's Westside neighborhood for cultural enrichment, elevating the profile of the Westside, and bringing new audiences-turned-patrons to the surrounding businesses. Located just off Southwest Boulevard, visits to la Esquina are often paired with excursions to the dozens of neighborhood taquerias, empanaderias, and Hispanic grocery stores; and our off-the-beaten-path location brings lures visitors outside of the standard selection of restaurants and museums/galleries to experience a unique aspect of Kansas City's cultural richness and diversity.","Charlotte Street regularly gathers quantitative and qualitative information on a regular basis from artists and audiences. Currently data is collected through final reports from award and residency recipients, through artist and audience surveys, small group discussions, and in-person interviews, including an exit interview with the CIR.  Additional demographic and other quantitative data is collected through the program applications. This information is used to help further refine and develop programs and improve our understanding of program outcomes. Every three to five years we have carried out assessments to gather opinions and ideas about CSF and its programs. The 2014 Program Assessment, carried out by the consulting firm Lutman & Associates, engaged more than 100 artists, CSF partners and other arts professionals through one-on-one interviews, small group discussions, and one large interactive workshop with artists inwhich observations, opinions and ideas were collected. The summary results of that work have continued to inform strategic planning and program development. In 2018, CSF will enter a new phase of artist- and audience-focused evaluation as we develop a new strategic plan. We have gathered information in a variety of ways, and periodically review our protocols against desired outcomes for programs and refine and streamline our evaluation strategy and protocols. Through a combination of both the periodic assessments carried out every three to five years and annual evaluations submitted by artists in our programs, examples of the kind of information in which we are interested includes: Has Charlotte Street Foundation's programming fostered artistic growth and increased the artistic ambition of artists? Have CSF-supported artists advanced their careers? Have new, meaningful connections and collaborations resulted among artists? Have artists expanded their professional networks? Has the program attracted a diverse, growing pool of highly qualified artist applicants? Has the program supported the creation and presentation of significant, innovative, ambitious new work? Have artists strengthened their ability and ease in communicating about their work and with audiences?With respect to audiences and the community, we seek to learn: Has the program fostered new/deeper connections between artists and members of the broader community/audience? Are audiences more likely to engage with artists and attend other arts events in the future? Have audiences increased their knowledge about, understanding of, and passion for artists and art? Has Kansas City's arts profile been elevated or enhanced as a result of Charlotte Street's programming? Is Kansas City attracting new audiences from within and beyond the greater Kansas City region as a result of Charlotte Street programming?","Data is collected through a variety of means. Attendance at each Charlotte Street Foundation event is tracked and monitored using the following categories: event date, event/program type, event location, number of days event took place, number of artists served, number of audience members served. As many of our larger events and partnerships are oriented toward particular audiences, some generalizations can be made with regard to the geography of participants and audience members. For example, in 2016, of the 3,520 audience members that participated in or attended programs at la Esquina, 1,815 (52%) can be attributed to collaborative programs that were oriented toward national audiences and individuals who traveled to Kansas City specifically for the purpose of attending cultural events, conferences, and programs. Further, based generally on the demographic data collected from CSF-supported artists (further articulated below), we estimate that a majority of the local/regional attendees travel from outside of Kansas City, Mo., boundaries to attend CSF programming. While Charlotte Street does not track demographic information for events & exhibitions, this information is collected for award and residency programs. Audience and participant demographics generally reflect those of the artists participating in our programming. A demographic summary of 2016 award and residency participants reflects the following demographic makeup: 40% of CSF Award recipients were people of color50% of Artboard artists were for people of color36% of 2016 Rocket Grant projects were led by people of color22% of 2016 Studio Residents were people of colorGender Ratios:Residency: 44% female 56%male (17% LGBTQ and/or gender nonconforming)CSF Awards: 20% female 80% male (40% LGBTQ and/or gender nonconforming)Rocket Grants: 50% female, 50% male (20% LGBTQ and/or gender nonconforming)Art boards: 50% female, 50% male (12% LGBTQ and/or gender nonconforming)","POINT (-94.596422 39.083562)","39.0837074 -94.5966968"

This season represents TYA's 44th year as a children's theatre providing quality and educational experiences for the entire family.  With funding from the NTDF, TYA can expand its audience reach for the tourists coming into the city for summer vacations.  Union Station has become the main destination for tourism during the summer, but TYA still struggles with visibility inside of a building with so many attractions.

During the summer Union Station has truly marketed itself and successfully become a tourist attraction for all visitors to the city.  As stated briefly earlier, TYA struggles with visibility and coming up with funds for advertisement.  During the summer hundreds of thousands of people visit the city with many of them stopping at Union Station for the large volume of activities.  With increased funding TYA will present the mainstage productions as tourist stops and a destination for the entire family.  During the summer competition for family activities is high.  With help from the NTDF TYA can continue to be competitive and produce high-quality performances during the hot summer months. Theatre for Young America provides an indoor activity for the very young to the great-grandparents.  We present an alternative to a movie, or an outdoor activity.  Again being located inside Union Station helps with the amount of tourists that visit each year.  TYA hopes to gain more tourism through reaching out during the busiest times at Union Station and connecting.  Once that connection is formed with the tourists, in from states like New York, South Carolina, Minnesota, Ohio, and Colorado, we have that bond with a higher chance of repeat theatre goers.  We promote through newspaper advertisement, radio spots, and local parenting magazines (i.e KC Parent).  We often have out of state patrons attend our shows traveling as far as New York.  Since many patrons are grandparents who visit their grandchildren we have customers who are in town for a short amount of time.  Again since Union Station is such a distinguished tourist attraction we benefit immensely from our prime location in downtown Kansas City.",,"Kansas City has over 20 million visitors each year!  National publications have put Kansas City as the ""Best Of"" for several years now and interest in our city is on track for continuous growth.  The interest in our vibrant, friendly city translates to Kansas City enjoying a resurgence of tourism and thousands of families are making Kansas City a destination stop during the year.  Projects like Google Fiber and being in consideration for the countries first Hyper Loop has put Kansas City as a top tourist destination. Since the revitalization of the city means more national media coverage we have become a tourist destination spot constantly growing our audience numbers annually. Theatre for Young America encounters thousands of grandparents each year who come to visit their grandchildren during breaks.  TYA has grandparents who call from North Carolina, New York, Alabama, Oklahoma, and Washington to plan their visit.  Since our shows are usually based on popular children's books families create an entire activity from reading the book at home to attend.  TYA creates educational, fun, lifelong memories for entire families of all ages.","Children's theatre is a popular family activity in the Kansas City metropolitan area and compared to different theatre's we serve a distinct population.  Our clientele has been consistent in attending our shows throughout the companies 40-year history.  Parents who take their children begin to take their grandchildren and so forth. Children who attend TYA shows later take their children. Kansas City is known for its rich, cultural arts venues and we are already an established company.  TYA believes that in opening the young minds of children knowledge of the arts they become lifelong supporters of theatre. One major thing TYA can depend on is our vast expertise in creating patrons that support the arts for the rest of their lives. The arts need support and when a child is exposed to them at an early age the benefits are endless. Even when a theatre student does not grow up to be directly involved in acting, or another area that student will be more likely to take their children to see a play, musical, art exhibit or opera.Theatre has been proven to teach children critical thinking and communication skills. Along with these positive attained attributes theatre also helps kids in all areas of their education. Kids are proven to test higher in reading, literature, math, science, and social studies. Children who experience theatre at a young age also can learn languages at a faster pace than children who are not exposed to the arts. Kids that experience to arts early in their childhood also learn social skills; including critical thinking and expanding their imaginations. The arts are also important for good health. Researchers have found that cultural activities have helped improve health and lower the risk of depression. Through self expression children can benefit because they are actively being creative. TYA has helped students develop their ability to visualize, listen attentively, think imaginatively, interpret feelings, be spontaneous, and the list goes on and on.TYA, the oldest children's theatre in Kansas City, was the first to introduce a full-time Director of Education. This enables TYA to offer a wide range of educational components: after school enrichment classes in drama, summer drama workshops, outreach lesson plans taught in area schools and youth centers, and study guides to augment every production.","Our entire 2017-2018 season will help Union Station, located in District 4, maintain a family friendly group activity during different seasons in Kansas City.  The summer there is a huge boost to tourism with many new tourists coming into the city visiting District 4.  As stated earlier, Union Station is a big tourist attraction in itself and many of the activities lean towards families. Also the attractions are constantly changing so Theatre for Young America brings in return customers almost every month with a new show.  This means a certain number of guaranteed patrons and families visiting the area.  The registered neighborhood benefits are economic as well.  Because of the success of Union Station and the expansions, including the Streetcar. The neighborhood is being revitalized.  More and more families drive downtown from the surrounding cities like Shawnee, Overland Park, Prairie Village, Independence, Blue Springs, and more.  The continued resurgence of downtown improves the economic health of the neighborhood with continued progress towards ease of accessibility.  Union Station has been going through renovations ensuring the new and old customer base maintains a high level of enjoyment when visiting.  Parking has been updated, the Planetarium renovated, Science City remolded, and the entrances to the building changed for better access.  These changes help present a family friendly environment that benefits the neighborhood and tourism.  When Theatre for Young America promotes our performances we always list our location as Union Station at H&R Block City Stage.  Our promotional material  reaches over 200,000 a year.  Since our brand of children's theatre is engaging, educational, and fun we present a platform for children to experience live performances consistently throughout the year while bringing in new patrons to Union Station.","Theatre for Young America uses the same methodology to measure our success each year measuring progress toward the goal of growing our audience TYA uses data from previous seasons, tracking the total number of confirmed reservations as a percentage of the season's final total. By mid November we would be looking to have 50% of the final number confirmed, 70% by March 1, and 88% by mid April.  The youth population of the metropolitan Kansas City area will be culturally, educationally, and emotionally enriched through their experiences with drama education. These young people will become better students, better citizens of their community and better adults as a result of these deeply meaningful and educationally vivid experiences. There will be a measurable increase in young adult audiences for other performing arts organizations in the metropolitan Kansas City area. Numerous parents and former students have volunteered information about the educational, social and vocational benefits of their acting class work.All productions planned during the previous year were in fact presented and all classes and workshops planned were also accomplished. An important objective of our work is to instill interest and enthusiasm for live theatre and for the literature on which many of our shows are based. We hear from both students and teachers their excitement about the plays they have seen and their continuing interest in reading the books dramatized on stage. We hear from teachers and parents about the beneficial effects of their children's experience with live theatre and with theatre classes and workshops. Theatre for Young America continues to have a loyal following of parents, educators and children. In the theatre lobby we often chat with grandparents who brought their now grown children to TYA and are now bringing the children of their children. After the last performance of Curious George a new father said"" I remember my mother bringing me to your old location in Mission Mall, and now we might have to get season tickets for my family!"". These testaments from our audience members helps TYA know that we are going in the right direction to produce theatre for decades to come.","Theatre for Young America has a long standing partnership with Kansas City Young Audiences, and their ArtsPartners program. With ArtsPartners' resources TYA books an additional 15,000 children, from Kansas City metropolitan schools, a year for a variety of programs including mainstage performances and touring productions. Theatre for Young America also always strives to be an inclusive environment. The past two summer camps our teaching artists have had students with developmental disabilities, like dyslexia. These students are never made to feel different, or less than. This extends into our stage shows, and is not just present in our various acting workshops. We also have touch tours available for the visually impaired after each show they attend. Our mainstage performers give the students a tour of the set so they can feel each prop and set piece. This gives them another level of inclusion that we are happy to provide.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853282 -94.5855784"

We are not asking for support for the actual production. To that end, the ask amount will allow us to have a reach of over 1.5 million people within a 150 mile radius of Kansas City. Only the funding for this project and its subsequent expenses and revenue are reflected in the budget. In 2015 Kansas City Ballet launched an all new The Nutcracker that broke box office records and received critical acclaim. Kansas City Ballet's presentation of The Nutcracker returns in December 2018, the 46th year KCB has performed The Nutcracker. We seek a grant of $20,000 from NTDF to fund a dedicated out of town marketing initiative, a non-budgeted but a significant and valuable addition to our efforts. Your investment in 2016 had significant impact on ticket sales and spending in Kansas City.

The annual production of The Nutcracker is one of KC's top holiday attractions, and thus receives support that's immeasurable to our success.",,"As a major regional ballet company, KC Ballet offers families outside of the city districts the annual chance to come to KC to see The Nutcracker. A production of this caliber is not available to them in their local areas, and thus families travel to KC. This trip to KC offers families to opportunity to shop, dine and take in other holiday events. Our hotel partner Hotel Phillips offers a special weekend package for families.","The annual attraction of The Nutcracker appeals to patrons of all ages and especially families celebrating the holidays in Kansas City. The tradition of attending The Nutcracker has spanned generations, making it for many, a yearly event. Many local families make this a complete night of activities that includes shopping, sightseeing, and dining.","Crossroads Community Association will promote through their various means to residents, businesses and tourists.","We measure success by ticket sales from outside of Kansas City, audience response and by hotel stays. We specifically will target the following cities: Columbia, MO, Fort Leavenworth, KS, Jefferson City, MO, Lawrence, KS, Saint Joseph, MO, Springfield, MO, Manhattan, KS, Topeka, KS, and Wichita, KS. NTDF's generous support of this marketing initiative has resulted in an average of 3,600 visitors and over $270,000 in ticket sales and order fees each year. Because demand for The Nutcracker remains high, we again project a similar number of tourists for the 2018 production. In addition, the city owned parking structure at the Kauffman Center would result an additional $10,000 in revenue, and the Kauffman Center will see an additional $23,400 in ticket fees. The Arts Council of Greater Kansas City estimates a visitor to an arts event spends on average $47.18. That would equate to $172,000 in revenue above ticket and fee revenue to Kansas City each of the past two years. In total, we are achieving an average 48 times return on investment for this initiative.","All patrons either log in to their existing account or create a new one when they purchase tickets.

To advance the mission of healing and self-sufficiency for homeless children and families, Sheffield Place offers four fully-integrated programs designed to meet the needs of families with multiple barriers to success (generational poverty, mental health, addicition, domestic violence, low educational attainment, felony convictions, among others):1)Residential Housing Services provides families with a private living unit with a bathroom and shared kitchen and laundry facilities.  Each family has a private living unit with a private bath (14 units have a maximum capacity of one mother and five children; three units have a maximum capacity of a mother and two children).  Five or 6 families share a kitchen on each of the three residential floors and a common laundry room in the basement.  Families with income pay one-third of their adjusted income as a program fee; mothers without income perform an additional chore.    2)Residential Clinical Services provides therapy and strengths-based case management services for mothers and their children.  This highly-structured program provides: an hour of therapy and an hour of case management each week along with the requirement that mothers participate in 8 hours of psycho-educational groups each week of the 23 hours offered; a nightly curfew; daily chores; and the requirement that mothers be employed, in school, or actively seeking employment.  Children take part in the psycho-educational Project HOPE program that is offered 23 hours each week.  3)Aftercare Clinical Services provides group and individual therapy and case management for families once they transition into permanent housing.  Families in the aftercare program receive case management services in their homes along with other supportive services for as long as necessary. Depending on the level of care needed, families return to the facility for therapy, groups, social events such as the summer backpack distribution, Thanksgiving dinner, and holiday party, and a monthly seminar on a Saturday with lunch, a topic of general interest, and child care.  Participation in the aftercare program has no cost.4)Permanent Housing Services provides housing for families in houses owned and operated by the agency.  Families in the permanent housing program receive supportive services through the aftercare program.  The permanent housing program provides a house or duplex for families for as long as the family wish to live in the house.  Sheffield Place currently operates 9 units of permanent housing.  The agency plans to own a total of 15 units over the next 18 months.  Families pay adjusted rent and utilities.

Since 1976, KCAC has been an important presenter of contemporary art in Kansas City, a venue for student, emerging, & established artists locally & around the world to exhibit in a professional venue.Contemporary visual artists are important to our community's heritage. This fundamental belief is why we support the work of living visual artists working in all mediums. A corollary of this is that aesthetic experiences are important in all lives & why we welcome all to the space to engage with art & artists at receptions & gallery talks.Solo exhibitions are an important part of our programming. An example is Paul Santoleri's installation in May/June 2018. His ""room drawings"" create a space where the viewer experiences art by walking through it. Consequently, the work becomes part of the architecture in which they exist. KCAC hosts many solo exhibitions throughout the year that are free & open to the public.Juried competitions engage prestigious judges from across the US to select exhibits from submitted artwork. KCAC's River Market Regional Exhibition is our annual juried competition. It is open to artists in a six state region. The exhibition & the catalog promote Kansas City & artists nationally. Our 2017 judge was esteemed artist-scholar, Curlee Raven Holton, Executive Director of the David C. Driskell Center, & senior artist-in-residence in the Department of Art at the University of Maryland. KCAC's annual Undergraduate College Student Show is open to currently enrolled students in Missouri & Kansas. This opportunity provides students with a professional exhibition to augment their academic career. Juried competitions like the above allow artists to build their resume & audience, while giving the public access to view a broad range of art.Snap Space is a new exhibition & curatorial program for artists 35 & younger.

KCAC is still seeing the positive effects from the 40th Anniversary Celebration in 2016, which was a testament to the community support and investment in the organization's mission and programming. There is a hand full of organizations still in existence that were created around the same time and for the same purpose as the Kansas City Artists Coalition. The ability for KCAC to withstand what crippled many other organizations calls to attention the communitys ability to realize the important role that KCAC plays in the arts scene of Kansas City, the region and the nation. This is something that participants in KCACs rich history of exhibitions and programming are able to acknowledge even if they are no longer present in the immediate Kansas City community. The connection that remains with artists and patrons near and far encouraged them to return to the organization to join in the momentous anniversary celebration and those relationships have continued to grow and cultivate stronger bonds with our constituency over the past year and a half. The KCAC Exhibition Series are free and open to the public, but includes a large variety of happenings that cater to many interests for people joining in from outside the Kansas City community. The exhibitions held at KCAC throughout the year boast a local flavor that tend to be particularly enticing to out of town guests and visitors to the Kansas City area. The Kansas City Light Rail helps to allow easy access to and from the venue throughout the year for guests to the Kansas City downtown area. Our target audience is artists, art patrons, community activists, and the art curious. Estimated total attendance through KCAC's 40+ year history has been a little over a quarter million.

These are just a few of the events hosted by KCAC outside of our exhibition series that regularly draws audiences from across the metropolitan area to KCAC and the River Market district. These events and opportunities are open to audiences of all genders, ages, cultures, and economic status.

We are planning a number of educational activities to accompany the production, including:  1) Our Student Dress Rehearsal program;  2) A program for area middle and high schools exploring the connections between West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet, in collaboration with the Heart of America Shakespeare Festival, including presentations of scenes from the play, the Guonod opera, and West Side Story;  3) A program for area high schools that explores issues of gangs and bullying, in collaboration with a bullying prevention activist, writer and educator;  4) Collaborating on a weekend dance intensive with the University of Missouri  Kansas City Conservatory of Music and Dance and local dancers who have toured nationally performing the original choreography.  West Side Story will also be featured in our community engagement programs that enhance the understanding and enjoyment of the art form. These include At Ease with Opera, which features presentations that focus on upcoming productions, and Opera Previews, which are presented before every performance at the Kauffman Center.  West Side Story belongs to a select group of works that straddle the two worlds of opera and musical theatre. It was created by artists who set out to surpass the expectations of their genre through musical and lyrical sophistication, balancing accessibility and high art.  Consequently, it is one of a select group of musical theatre works that can be enhanced by the skill and scale of an opera house. Our production will give our audience the opportunity to see and hear West Side Story at the scale at which it was conceived. West Side Story will be an exploration of how we can both present and define the operatic experience in fresh and accessible ways, by producing a work that challenges the conventional distinction between opera and musical theatre, a distinction that has been notoriously difficult to define. By offering our current audience a new lens to explore the elements that define the genre, and by introducing new and more diverse audiences who are not yet familiar with traditional opera, we can both broaden and deepen our role in the community, and increase the accessibility of the operatic experience.","4","4","Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts","1601 Broadway Blvd.","64108","N/A","Cultural","The performances will occur at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts at 1601 Broadway in the Crossroads Arts District, which is in the area between downtown Kansas City and Crown Center.

People who are already familiar with opera, and who are seeking a wider definition of what an opera company can be in the 21st century, will have the opportunity to explore the conventional boundaries of the art form.  Also, the Kauffman Center, where the performances will take place, has enormous appeal as an event destination.  The New York Times music critic Zachary Woolfe called it one of the most enjoyable, exhilarating arts centers Ive been to, a moving celebration of a citys upward trajectory.  Moreover, as the only professional opera company within a two hundred mile radius, we are able to draw patrons from many surrounding communities.","The Lyric Opera has established a local reputation for artistic excellence, and this reputation for work that is always spectacular will draw audiences from other neighborhoods.  Residents from other neighborhoods will also be drawn to the event because the Lyric is strengthening its presence across the city through its numerous educational and community engagement programs.  In addition, the local publicity preceding and accompanying the Lyric's production of Everest will attract residents from other neighborhoods because the publicity will highlight the strong appeal of this particular work, which is a beloved piece of musical theatre.  We expect the production to reach a particularly broad and diverse audience.  People new to opera can experience the level of artistry that typifies the art form in the context of a more familiar genre, as they are presented with a particularly accessible means of exploring what is, to them, a new form of lyrical expression.  People who are already familiar with opera, and who are seeking a wider definition of what an opera company can be in the 21st century, will have the opportunity to explore the conventional boundaries of the art form.","Because we are staging six performances of this production, instead of the usual four, we anticipate that 8,600 persons will come to the neighborhood to see the six public performances of West Side Story.  Many will combine their attendance at the performances with dining at nearby restaurants, and visiting nearby shops and retail establishments.  To increase this traffic, the Lyric Opera has a partnership with restaurants in the Crossroads District (Grunauer at 101 West 22nd Street and Affare at 1911 Main) for a dinner and a show special that encourages dining at these Crossroads restaurants.  Of these 8,600 attendees, 2,494 will be residents of Kansas City, MO, and thus live close enough to the Crossroads neighborhood to regularly return following this exposure to the attractions that the neighborhood has to offer.","After the final performance of West Side Story, the production and artistic staff will discuss all aspects of the production including the performances, how successful the director, conductor and design team were in creating the artistic vision, and how well the orchestra and conductor executed the score. The Lyric also monitors critical reviews in newspapers and magazines and online, as well as comments by individuals via e-mail. The director of education and community engagement and the general director will evaluate the success and impact of the accompanying activities, and follow up with the area organizations we have partnered with, to further the Lyrics ongoing priority of increasing its presence in the community.  The Lyric also records the addresses of attendees in its computer database, and will evaluate the success of the production in bringing in tourists from outside the greater Kansas City metropolitan area, and drawing area residents to the neighborhood.","In calculating the tourism impact of this event, we used our ticketing database, which records who has bought tickets to our past productions, and where those ticket buyers are from.  Our ticketing database indicates that, for a typical production at the Lyric Opera, 71% of attendees are from outside of Kansas City, Missouri, and 9% are from far enough way to stay at a hotel when they come to see the show.  Applying these percentages to the 8,600 attendees we expect for the six performances of West Side Story, 71% or 6,106 attendees will be from outside of Kansas City Missouri, and 9% or 774 attendees will be from far enough away to stay at a hotel when they come to see the show.So what is the economic impact of these numbers?  For one thing, the 6,106 tourists from outside Kansas City, Missouri who attend West Side Story will combine their attendance at the performances with dining at nearby restaurants, and visiting nearby shops and retail establishments.  For example, the Lyric Opera has a partnership with some of the restaurants in the Crossroads District for a dinner and a show special.We can project the dollar value of this event-related spending.  Over the years, the arts advocacy group Americans for the Arts has compiled data about all the things that people spend money on when they attend an arts event.  As a result, they have created an economic impact calculator which, when information is entered about the number of attendees, the size of the metropolitan area, and the presenting organization, will calculate the amount of event-related spending by attendees, which includes money spent at nearby restaurants, retail establishments, hotels, and parking.  Plugging in the projected numbers for West Side Story, the economic impact calculator predicts over $297,289 in event-related spending by people coming to see the production.  71%, or over $211,075, of this event-related spending will come from non-residents of Kansas City.    As mentioned above, we can predict that 774 of the tourists coming to West Side Story will come from far enough away that they will be staying at a hotel while they are here.  Being conservative, and assuming that they will be staying just one night, that they are couples so that there are two people in every hotel room, and that the average hotel room will be $114 a night, that comes to $44,118 in hotel income.","POINT (-94.588707 39.093796)","39.0941843 -94.5875135"

Today over 1,000,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. In Kansas City, 5,700 men, women and children are dealing with the everyday struggles of the disease. HIV/AIDS infections are on the rise in minorities, specifically African-American women and gay men between the ages of 18 and 35. In addition, 50% of everyone infected with HIV is unaware of their status. HIV/AIDS continues to be an issue in our city and there remains a need to raise much needed funds for those living with the disease and to raise awareness of the disease. AIDS WALK Kansas City and its satellite events attract a wide cross-section of our community and support those men, women and children who are living with or at risk of HIV/AIDS infection. We are in schools with students at crisis with the MOSAIC Art Project, which brings area youth, volunteers and artists together to create 6"" x 6"" glazed ceramic tiles designed to reflect the project's theme, ""A World Without AIDS"". MOSAIC educates students about HIV/AIDS, giving them information on its prevention and helps students accept those living with the disease as part of a society. AIDS WALK also educates students about the risk of HIV/AIDS by supporting Coterie Theatre's Dramatic AIDS Education Project, a collaborative effort with the Department of Prevention Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center. This compelling theatrical work is produced as an interactive program and workshop made up of medical students and professional actors. It is presented for free at middle and high schools throughout the Kansas City region. All walks of life are invited to participate in all AIDS WALK activities throughout the year.

In the spring of 2018, Folk Alliance International (FAI) will move its headquarters from the current location in the River Market to a larger location that borders the Crossroads neighborhood and Westside neighborhood. As a part of the relationship with this building's developer, FAI is committing to producing public programming in the space on a regular basis with the intention to uplift folk music culture in Kansas City while creating a cultural and strategic link between the Crossroads and Westside neighborhoods. There has never been a more exciting time for FAI's role in Kansas City's arts community. Programming this space (which is a retail space on street level) on a regular basis will build a stronger folk music culture in Kansas City and build that folk culture into the west side of the Crossroads district. Finest Folk: First Friday Concerts will be regularly held (ideally monthly) First Friday performances that will be free with public invitations and public access. FAI will work with regional promotional partners; include a mix of regional, national and international artists; curate a diverse line-up of talent, and build programming based on community interest and community need. While the programming is not currently set, examples could include jam sessions that build an awareness of oral traditions, concerts featuring up-and-coming regional acts and national touring acts, special presentations, workshops, folk-specific student performances, and a wide range of creative projects. These First Friday events will be fun and accessible, promoted under the Kansas City Folk Festival brand. Approximate attendance of Finest Folk: First Friday Concerts will be 250 people at each event or 3,000 over the course of the year. The exact start date of these concerts will depend on when FAI will have access to the new space. It is anticipated that there should be access by April 2018, so ideally the first concert would occur in May 2018. As a side note, FAI also plans to use the new office space for professional development sessions, listening room concerts, and workshops.

It is intended to foster friendly and effective cooperation among members, to promote good sportsmanship, and to maintain an intercollegiate athletic program that is part of, and in proper perspective with, the total education program of the member institutions. Each member institution has the duty to adopt policies and to establish procedures that will ensure a wholesome and safe environment for intercollegiate competition. The Mid America Intercollegiate Athletics Association asserts the value of equitable participation and treatment of men and women in intercollegiate athletics through its structure, programs, legislation, and policies. It is the responsibility of each member institution and the Association to act affirmatively to assure equity in the quality and quantity of participation in intercollegiate athletics. It is important that at the institutional level gender equity in intercollegiate athletics provides an environment in which a fair and equitable distribution of overall athletic opportunities, benefits, and resources are available to men and women, and in which student athletes, coaches, and athletics administrators are not subject to gender based discrimination.","The MIAA works with the Kansas City Sports Commission, VisitKC and our 14 member institutions to promote this event. We also work with the Downtown Marriott for tournament personnel lodging, participating team lodging and to provide a fan block for those traveling in. We utilize another downtown property to provide lodging for game officials and additional game production personnel. WIN for KC has also worked with the MIAA on a community engagement initiative where local elementary students complete fitness and reading goals. When those goals are reached, they are able to take part in a field trip to the tournament and receive free admission. The top achieving students are recognized at halftime of the game they attend. We also arrange a meal credit for some teams with local downtown restaurants. VisitKC has also set up a KC information table at the tournament for several years.",,"If visitors have an interest in competitive intercollegiate athletics, they will attend this event and have a positive experience. The tournament will be attractive for those visitors coming in from outside Kansas City to support their participating teams. The participating teams could come from anywhere in the MIAA footprint  institutions are located in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma.","With over 80,000 alumni in the KCMO area, these alumni have proven their interest with their attendance at prior events. Many participating MIAA teams also feature studentathletes from the KC area.","The downtown area will be promoted by recognizing relationships with various downtown businesses (hotels and restaurants). Many alumni groups also tend to hold gatherings on their own at various venues downtown, however, these gatherings are not organized by the MIAA. All of our teams, officials and tournament personnel stay at downtown KCMO hotels as well.","We really measure success as a combination of meeting our attendance goal, as well as providing an atmosphere, throughout the 4 day tournament, that is positive and memorable. We want fans from all teams to feel welcome and excited about not only the tournament itself, but also about Kansas City as a destination. We have received positive feedback throughout the years from officials, fans and participants, but we want to keep finding ways to improve from year to year.","The participating institutions do sell some tickets directly to their fans, but that doesn't necessarily tell us where those persons live. Information will simply be collected visually to determine which team the fans are there supporting. While a number of basketball student athletes competing in the MIAA are from the Kansas City area, the majority are from outside the area, as well as their families and friends.","POINT (-94.58697 39.0988)","39.0982534 -94.5874878"

This venue, which will serve as a platform to highlight emerging experimental and hybrid performance practices, will demonstrate further dedication to the development of audiences for Kansas City's performing arts community. Since 2008, Charlotte Street's flexible exhibition/performance space La Esquina has played host to a variety of theatrical, dance, spoken word, and music performances, intermittently and interwoven with a schedule of visual art exhibitions. The new venue will be an effort to dedicate a space specific to the needs of performance, and to develop a denser and more consistent cadence of performance programming.This space will be filled by applications to our ongoing Open Call, working with residents from the Studio Residency Program, and collaborating with local, regional, and national emerging and established generative performing arts producers (such as Owen/Cox Dance Group, Fishtank Theatre, and Fountainverse Poetry Festival, all of whom we are working with this year at our La Esquina venue). Launched in tandem with the Broadway Venue, CSF will also be launching the storefront next door, 1662 Broadway, as the location of our Startup Residency Program. This program seeks to incubate burgeoning artist-run nonprofits, collaboratives, and organizations in a prominent storefront space to help catalyze their programming, mentor and assist in sourcing resources and infrastructure, and build audience. The first resident, which has already been selected via a juried process, is Stray Cat Microcinema. They will launch with film screenings, workshops, and educational lectures and presentations.

We cultivate the contemporary, the exceptional, and the unexpected in the practice of artists working in and engaging with the Kansas City art community. Founded in 1997, Charlotte Street Foundation (CSF) supports and recognizes outstanding artists in Kansas City; promotes, enhances, and encourages the visual, performing, literary and interdisciplinary arts; and fosters community development in the greater Kansas City region. Through innovation and responsiveness to the real needs expressed by Kansas Citys community of artists, Charlotte Street has established itself as a nationally recognized model for supporting artists, contributing significantly to the development of the local arts community, and advocating for the important cultural and economic impact of local artists and grassroots arts activity. Through financially supporting, presenting, and promoting the work of contemporary Kansas City area artists, Charlotte Street has enhanced Kansas City's vitality as a regional center for contemporary art. During 2018-2019, Charlotte Street will continue to offer key programming that has made the organization an innovative leader in support of individual artists including: 1. AWARDS & GRANTS: Five unrestricted cash awards and two travel grants will be given to Kansas City artists as chosen by an esteemed panel of jurors. Through Andy Warhol's re-granting program, Charlotte street administers 6-8 grants each year for progressive, innovative, public facing art projects and commissions. 2. ARTIST & CURATORIAL RESIDENCIES: Providing free studio and exhibition space for 80+ artists every year including mentoring and professional development. Supporting an 18-month curatorial residency program connecting local artists with national artists in discussions and exhibitions. 3. EXHIBITIONS & PUBLIC PROGRAMS: Providing opportunities for local artists and curators to propose projects including exhibitions, performances and other events through a competitive selection process. Other public programs include an annual Open Studios program and Artboards billboard commissions presented by Mobank. Charlotte Street partners with Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, H & R Block Artspace at Kansas City Art Institute and the Folly Theater to attract new programming and recognition for individual artists in Kansas City & for our artist community. NEW IN 2018-2019, CSF will offer an increased emphasis on performance- and film-based programming by launching a new performance-focused venue at 17th & Broadway, based in the Crossroads Arts District and in close proximity to the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.","Charlotte Street Foundation will distribute printed cards and programs to hotels, tourist destinations in the Crossroads and downtown area, and information centers such as Union Station. Thanks to CSF's strong network of programming partners across Kansas City, the organization frequently partners to cross-promote events and exhibitions. Additionally, Charlotte Street Foundation is an active user of the city-wide ArtsKC Go calendar, having supported the development as a beta user and early adopter. Through ArtsKC Go, CSF attracts residents and out-of-town visitors alike, offering a robust sampling of cultural arts opportunities, and clear and easy access to event schedules, tickets, and information. Charlotte Street regularly participates and partners with national art associations and other Kansas City arts organizations to support and present conferences and conventions such as the 2016 NCECA conference, the 2017 International Sculpture Conference, and the 2018 Open Spaces initiative.","Charlotte Street Foundation is a member of the Crossroads Community Association. The mission of CCA is to support, promote, advance, and encourage the revitalization of the community as a thriving, safe and attractive center of art, history, enterprise, commerce, culture, residence, entertainment, education and other activity; to inform and educate the members of this association and the public about community issues; to provide a forum to address community objectives and issues; to build a strong community through communication, cooperation, planning and leadership; to build a strong partnership between business owners, property owners, tenants and residents to ensure community involvement; and to enhance the quality of life within the community. Accordingly, CSF will work closely to promote this new space through the CCA website, and identify opportunities to partner with restaurants, businesses, and other arts organizations to align programming with other events and programs, and provide opportunities for CSF audience members to extend their time in the Crossroads by visiting other art and cultural organizations and patronizing Crossroads restaurants and businesses.","Charlotte Street's broad range of programming, taking place in established, emerging, and impromptu sites throughout Kansas City for the past two decades, has already proven to be a significant attraction to visitors traveling to Kansas City for arts and culture. We estimate that more than half of our audience members travel from outside the city to participate in cultural activities in Kansas City, Missouri, underscoring a recently released report by Americans for the Arts, which indicated that 81% of tourists who attended an arts or cultural event traveled to Kansas City traveled for that specific purpose. In 2018, as a confederation of arts and civic organizations work in partnership with the City of Kansas City, Missouri, to attract national and international festival-goers to a major contemporary art fair, Charlotte Street Foundation is certain to attract hundreds if not thousands of attendees to visit its exhibitions and attend programming featuring Kansas City's most cutting-edge contemporary artists. The live performances and film series that will be presented at Charlotte Streets new venue in the Crossroads will offer visitors to Kansas City a one-of-a-kind opportunity to experience Kansas City's cultural richness, by connecting to its most innovative, independent, and forward-thinking audiences. Its proximity to the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, the Kansas City Convention Center, as well as its situation within the Crossroads Arts District, will provide visitors to Kansas City with a broadened view of Kansas Citys rich community of artists and performers by providing an expanded view of the wide-ranging work being produced by Kansas City artists. The work being presented in this new space will be unduplicated within Kansas City.","The Crossroads Arts District has emerged as a center for art and artists in Kansas City, and has benefitted greatly from the groundswell of support for the arts in Kansas City. Belief in the power of artists is at the core of Charlotte Street Foundation's mission and programs. Over the past 20 years, as opportunities have arisen and resources available, Charlotte Street has constructed an interlocking array of programs and services that respond to the needs of local artists: spaces and resources for creating and presenting their work; opportunities for convening, collaborating, networking and community building; professional development and mentorship; platforms for critical dialogue, exposure and feedback; and opportunities to reach and connect with new audiences and patrons. By providing opportunities for artists to develop work, explore ideas and methods, experiment and take risks, gain exposure and expand their networks, and increase their professional acumen, they are able to reach new audiences, improve the sustainability of their careers, and contribute to the large cultural dynamic that makes Kansas City unique. No other Kansas City arts organization provides this unique mix of programs designed specifically for contemporary artists to develop individually and collectively, and to help artists build sustainable careers. The artistic excellence and unique quality of Charlotte Street's programming has established the organization as a national model, and developed a tremendously committed audience and support network within Kansas City. Throughout 2017, Charlotte Street connected and engaged across the city in celebration of its 20th anniversary, building partnerships with nearly 20 organizations including the Kansas City Public Library, the Blue Room at the American Jazz Museum, the Kansas City Museum, H&R Block Artspace, the Nerman Museum, Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas, and more. Through this strategic effort to broaden audiences and increase awareness of CSF's programming, the organization connected with more than 39,000 audience members and programming participants in 2017. We anticipate that the new relationships and heightened public awareness will equate to continued growth in participation and attendance at CSF exhibitions, programs, and collaborations, and will help to attract audience members and visitors to CSF's newly established Broadway Venue.","Charlotte Street's new performance-oriented Broadway Venue and Startup Residency featuring Stray Cat Microcinema will enrich the Crossroads Arts District by reinvigorating its grassroots, off-the-beaten-path cultural identity. As the neighborhood becomes more established and real estate costs increase, many of the smaller and more avant garde art galleries and spaces have moved to other parts of the city - - or in some cases, have become nomadic or shuttered altogether. Thanks to a very generous arrangement with developer Copaken Brooks, Charlotte Street Foundation will have the opportunity to occupy a prominent space that has been empty for more than a decade, and will focus on the types of emerging and experimental, forward-thinking art that established the Crossroads as a center for contemporary art and culture. Charlotte Street Foundation's new space, located at 17th and Broadway, just across the street from the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts, will serve artists by providing a space in which to explore new ideas, test new productions, and present truly innovative and experimental music and dance, hybrid or multidisciplinary work, and short-run independent and foreign films. In addition to providing space, Charlotte Street Foundation will tap its extensive regional and national network to bring new and returning audiences to the Crossroads (attendance at CSF-affiliated programming exceeded 39,000 in 2017). Audiences that have counted on the Crossroads Arts District as a place to view surprising and engaging works of art and performance will again be afforded that opportunity, and artists that would not otherwise have the opportunity to work and present in this cultural center will have time, space, and financial and promotional support to work in the Crossroads Arts District.","Charlotte Street regularly gathers quantitative and qualitative information on a regular basis from artists and audiences. Currently data is collected through final reports from award and residency recipients, through artist and audience surveys, small group discussions, and in-person interviews, including an exit interview with the CIR. Additional demographic and other quantitative data is collected through the program applications. This information is used to help further refine and develop programs and improve our understanding of program outcomes. Every three to five years we have carried out assessments to gather opinions and ideas about CSF and its programs. A 2014 Program Assessment, carried out by the consulting firm Lutman & Associates, engaged more than 100 artists, CSF partners and other arts professionals through one-on-one interviews, small group discussions, and one large interactive workshop with artists in which observations, opinions and ideas were collected. The summary results of that work have continued to inform strategic planning and program development. In 2018, CSF will enter a new phase of artist- and audience-focusedevaluation as we develop a new strategic plan. We have gathered information in a variety of ways, and periodically review our protocols against desired outcomes for programs and refine and streamline our evaluation strategy and protocols. Through a combination of both the periodic assessments carried out every three to five years and annual evaluations submitted by artists in our programs, examples of the kind of information in which we are interested includes: Has Charlotte Street Foundation's programming fostered artistic growth and increased the artistic ambition of artists? Have CSF-supported artists advanced their careers? Have new, meaningful connections and collaborations resulted among artists? Have artists expanded their professional networks? Has the program attracted a diverse, growing pool of highly qualified artist applicants? Has the program supported the creation and presentation of significant, innovative, ambitious new work? Have artists strengthened their ability and ease in communicating about their work and with audiences?With respect to audiences and the community, we seek to learn: Has the program fostered new/deeper connections between artists and members of the broader community/audience? Are audiences more likely to engage with artists and attend other arts events in the future? Have audiences increased their knowledge about, understanding of, and passion for artists and art? Has Kansas City's arts profile been elevated or enhanced as a result of Charlotte Street's programming? Is Kansas City attracting new audiences from within and beyond the greater Kansas City region as a result of Charlotte Street programming?","Data is collected through a variety of means including hand-held clickers, ticket sales, online registrations, and other means. Attendance at each Charlotte Street Foundation event is tracked and monitored using the following categories: event date, event/program type, event location, number of days event took place, number of artists served, number of audience members served. As many of our larger events and partnerships are oriented toward particular audiences, some generalizations can be made with regard to the geography of participants and audience members. Based generally on the demographic data collected from CSF-supported artists (further articulated below), we estimate that a majority of the local/regional attendees travel from outside of Kansas City, Mo., boundaries to attend CSF programming. While Charlotte Street does not track demographic information for events and exhibitions, this information is collected for award and residency programs. Audience and participant demographics generally reflect those of the artists participating in our programming. A demographic summary of 2017 award and residency participants reflects the following demographic makeup: artists supported were 51% white, 44% people of color (7% non-reporting). Gender ratios reflects 49% male, 39% female, and 12% transgender or gender nonconforming. With regard to geography, using social media followers as an indicator, the nearly 50% of CSF's Facebook followers that are based outside of Kansas City, Mo., would likely correspond to the percentage of in-person attendees who travel from outside Kansas City to attend and participate in events and programs.",,"39.093153 -94.5889649"

We will also promote the event at the Union Station Information Booth and in other public spaces throughout the building and nearby hotels. KC Creates' marketing team has done a great job of developing relationships with the local news media, and each of our events typically attracts coverage from at least one news station or television show. BetterKC invites us to appear on their show for most of our events. In 2017, KC Creates developed a new strategic plan. One high-priority item that was identified by the board was marketing and cross-promotion of our events. The board and staff developed a marketing plan that ensures that all KC Creates events are cross-promoted, which is expected to increase attendance at all events.","While there is no formal neighborhood organization, businesses located in Union Station are very supportive of this event, and one is already signed up to participate. We are inviting all businesses in Union Station to participate.","InspireKC builds on Kansas City's reputation as a burgeoning center for arts. This event is expected to have a regional draw - companies from all over the metropolitan area will participate, but all public events are being held in Union Station. All funds requested for this event are supporting ONLY the  events and public exhibits held at Union Station. Each individual company bears the costs of its own internal competition.","This event will appeal to art lovers - there will be visual art, music, dance and literary art. While not child-themed, it is family-friendly and will be enjoyed by everyone. Many participating companies are located in Kansas City, Missouri, which will draw foot traffic and attendance from those companies.","This event will draw approximately 5000 visitors from all over the metropolitan area to Union Station over three weeks, and it will also be an additional attraction for other visitors already in the building for other purposes.","This program will be measured by participation, attendance, external reviews or features and a survey of participating companies. The specifics of the survey have not yet been established, we are working with the businesses to determine their goals and purposes for participation. In prior years, companies participating indicated that increased innovation, teambuilding, camraderie, employee satisfaction are high priorities. Long-term outcomes are to increase participation in the arts, and contributing to the vibrant cultural economy of Kansas City.","If we meet our goal of increasing the number of participating companies, about 1200 artists will participate in this program, with about 360 of them competing in the city-wide finals at Union Station. We know from prior participation that each participating artist typically brings 3 guests for the visual arts exhibit (an additional 1800 people). For the semi-finals, the theater seats 200, and there are three nights of semi-finals and one final event (up to 800 people). Average annual attendance at Union Station is 1,500,000 which averages out to be approximately 4,109 people per day over a 15 day exhibit. We reached the total audience members by combining the following: Participating Artists (1200), Estimated Artist Guests (3600), Performing Arts Audience Members (800) Union Station General Foot Traffic (61,643). While KC Creates does not have a specific count on how many people come from outside Kansas City, Missouri, we do know from the ArtsKC/Americans for the Arts ""Arts & Economic Impact Study"" that about half of all arts audiences in the metropolitan Kansas City area come from the Kansas side of the state line.

KCAT was originally founded in the spirit of giving local artists the opportunity to perform artist-driven classic and contemporary-classic plays in Kansas City, and we continue that mission today. Our artistic focus is specifically on the artists working on our productions and allowing them to do high-quality professional work in a way that no other company in town does. In turn, Kansas City benefits from not only having the opportunity to experience stories that might not otherwise be told, but also from having a vibrant local arts culture that is supported by the cumulative efforts of the artistic community at large.In keeping with our mission, the Artistic Committee is committed to selecting smart plays that challenge and enlighten both the artists involved and the audience by producing classic and modern-classic plays, particularly by playwrights whose works are not staged very often in the metro area.Perhaps the best argument for the appeal of our programming is our longevity and our consistent growth and support over our history.

Surveys distributed at each performance and through e- blasts capture additional information on county of residence, age, household income, theatre experience satisfaction, etc. for audience members. 2) Quality of Productions: Success is defined by solid reviews of our shows and patron feedback. We blend professional reviews with audience response to measure the quality of services. Our core audience is responsive with comments - both in artist talkbacks and in writing. Numerous actors from this community and surrounding states are regular attendees, and we seek their professional commentary.","We distribute and collect paper surveys at our productions that collect demographic data and audience feedback for individual productions. We also capture address information with our ticket sales. We will soon be transitioning to an online survey that will be e-mailed to patrons after attending a performance.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853282 -94.5855784"

The fragrant scent of aromatic wood smoke, the flickering firelight on the arched bridges, the silhouettes of the fire tenders passing by, the torchlit vessels traveling down the river, and the enchanting music from around the world, engage all the senses and emotions of those who stroll the banks of Brush Creek. The urban landscape becomes a living work of art, and integrates live music, dance and fire performances in the dark. Eagerly anticipated by thousands of Kansas Citians every year, WaterFire is a memorable, and often transformative experience. For many attendees WaterFire is their first immersive art experience. Participants and observers actively experience how imagination changes the landscape.  WaterFire KC is modeled after renouned artist Barnaby Evans' original WaterFire installation in Providence, Rhode Island. In Providence, seventeen WaterFire ""lightings"" happen between March and November each year. Each lighting has a different theme, from the November ""Salute to Veterans"" to ""Celebration of Life"", a benefit for cancer patients. Cited by the [Providence Journal] in 1997 as the most popular work of art created in the capital citys 371year history and by Friedrich St. Florian as the crown jewel of the Providence renaissance, WaterFire continues to grow and gain in popularity.  It has brought over ten million visitors to downtown Providence, revitalizing Rhode Islands capital city. KC Creates' goal is to grow WaterfireKC in a similar fashion, while still reflecting the unique culture and arts community Kansas Citians know and love.","4","4","Country Club Plaza, Brush Creek","Ward Parkway","64110","This event spans two blocks and will be held on Ward Parkway between Broadway and Wyandotte Streets, as well as on the boardwalk and banks along both the north and south sides of Brush Creek.","Cultural","This event occurs on the Country Club Plaza. As part of obtaining the proper permits for street closures, food and beverage vendors, and more, KC Creates must obtain the written permission of each business in the area impacted by our activities.

We work closely with VisitKC for KC Creates' other events, including the KC Fringe Festival, Fringe Presents, and Inspire. This event is located on the Country Club Plaza. The Plaza plays host to tourists and Kansas Citians alike. We will promote the event in public spaces throughout the Plaza and in nearby hotels and restaurants. In 2017, KC Creates' board and volunteer staff created a three-year strategic plan. A key element of this plan is increasing our marketing and brand recognition. In 2018, KC Creates marketing team will create a cohesive brand and comprehensive marketing plan that will include cross promotion of all KC Creates events. Waterfire will be promoted at the KC Fringe Festival and InspireKC. And KC Fringe Festival performers will perform at Waterfire. We expect this improved marketing and branding strategy to result in increased attendance at Waterfire and all of KC Creates' annual events. We will invest heavily in our marketing initiatives during the coming year.","KC Creates works closely with Plaza security, event and marketing staff to execute this event. In addition to Plaza staff, KC Creates also works closely with the Kansas City Parks & Recreation Department on several aspects of this event. Our partnerships with both entities are crucial to the execution of our event. Restaurants on the Country Club Plaza provide letters of support for our permit requests every year. We have attached a previous letter from the 2016 event to demonstrate ongoing support. These letters are procured by Country Club Plaza marketing staff.","Because this event is based on the very successful Barnaby Evans ""Waterfire"" in Providence, Rhode Island, there is some national recognition of this event. Only the second city to have a WaterFire installation, people from outside Kansas City may be drawn to experience the installation here in Kansas City. Similar to the above note, this is a rare chance for an audience member to attend a free event and experience multiple performers of this quality and recognition.","This event is appealing to people of all ages and backgrounds. This is a free event, and it includes visual art, music, dance and even puppets. This is the only free event in Kansas City where an audience member can attend for free and see two opera performances, drummers, belly dancers, fire dancers/breathers, a performance by Quixotic, Stone Lion Puppets, and a two-block long visual arts installation. It is attractive to families, elders and young people alike. This event appeals to all the senses. The visual portion is stunning on its own; you don't need to be able to hear to enjoy it. The musical element included well-known opera singers Justin McCoy and Trio Forte. A person without sight would enjoy the music and fragrant fires. And because it is held right on the street, people in wheelchairs are also able to see and enjoy the fires.","This event attracted approximately 15,000 visitors to the Country Club Plaza in 2017. We expect 2018 crowds to exceed 20,000. These audience counts are estimates provided by the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department, which provides security for the event. At its peak, Waterfire attracted nearly 30,000 people. After changing hands twice in two years, Waterfire has now found its permanent home with KC Creates, and our intent is to grow the festival aggressively. Our first benchmark is to rebuild to its original peak of 30,000, then grow the event further as we grow our donor base.","The success of this event is measured by attendance and audience feedback. Some audience feedback is included in the ""Supplemental Documents"" section of this application. Increasing attendance each year indicates that our audiences enjoy the experience as well as the performances.","The Kansas City, Missouri Police Department estimated that we had about 15,000 audience members in 2017. We plan to aggressively grow this event each year. We estimate that 20,000 people will attend in 2018, and about half of them will come from Johnson County, KS. The Arts & Economic Impact Study, a collaboration between ArtsKC and Americans for the Arts, consistently demonstrates that about half of KC metropolitan arts audiences come from Kansas and about half come from Missouri. Further study indicates that Johnson and Jackson counties show the highest rates of arts participation in the metropolitan area. In 2017, volunteers collected audience feedback, and those results are being compiled. The results of that survey will be available in December of 2017.",,"39.0000256 -94.603004"

Our relationship with AAA will be expanded as well. The Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, in Washington, DC, has given us permission to use and edit a video about Kansas City Jazz.  We will expand this relationship to include their assistance in the promotion of the Jazz Walk of Fame to their community and constituents.

We are leveraging these connections and expanding our efforts into the national and international markets this year. Jazz is loved, studied, played, practiced and honored all over the world.  Kansas City and the American Jazz Walk of Fame will be on that stage and included in future travel itineraries.","During planned Stakeholder meetings, we will ask for volunteer assistance and ask for feedback regarding how we can improve the event's impact on the neighborhood based upon their experience from the previous four years.","Our reputation as a place to experience Jazz will be reinforced by those attending the annual event and visiting the permanent installation of the 25 bronze medallions now embedded in the sidewalks of 18th street.

We were recognized by AAA Midwest Traveler as a Midwest Travel Treasure whose publication is read by more than 840,000 frequent travelers.

The American Jazz Walk of Fame honors artists from the past who may not have received any recognition before. Lifelong Kansas City residents now have something new to experience in a familiar area of their city. The American Jazz Walk of Fame also recognizes contemporary artists, giving newer and perhaps younger residents another reason to visit the district.  Musicians are inspired to develop their craft and continue the growth of the jazz genre knowing their efforts could be recognized in the same way.The bronze medallions are a permanent feature that is not tied to the annual event date. Visitors have the benefit of enjoying this history and culture all year long.","The Jazz Walk of Fame has attracted a diverse audience, both geographically and ethnically, for the past four years. Our guests have traveled to the Jazz District from areas outside of the greater Kansas City boundaries. In 2015 & 2016, we had several guests from the Washington, DC area. These guests represented communities from around the country. Many had never visited Kansas City before.  Marketing efforts will bring attention to these neighborhoods and encourage visitation. Often, perceptions of different communities are formed without personal experience. The Jazz Walk of Fame provides an additional reason to venture into new areas of the city or to revisit familiar areas creating another benefit to the community.","We measure success using several metrics, survey feedback and observations. The result of our fundraising efforts, both in kind and cash contributions, clearly reflect a level of monetary success. The number of tickets sold for the concert, the number of people attending the VIP reception and the number folks witnessing the medallion reveal indicate participation success.  The amount of media and press hits reveal how successful we were with promotion and exposure. Included in the exposure consideration is our social media mentions. Financial data, ticket reports, survey results and media mentions have been used to evaluate our project in the past. We are including social media platform evaluation efforts for 2018.","We distributed a survey in 2016 to determine the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. The return of those surveys was very high and we plan to do the same this year with questions geared toward demographics. We plan to utilize our social media platforms to assist in collecting demographic information. We relied on ticket sales data and observed filled seats for both the concert and reveal numbers. We also relied on observations from KCPD security. We are considering ways to ascertain the medallion visitation numbers that occur throughout the year. Using visitor numbers from the American Jazz Museum and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum is a start but it would not confirm the number of visitation of the medallion locations in places other than those in front of the museum.Our plan this year is to include a survey that can be completed on line.","POINT (-94.563686 39.09121)","39.0912481 -94.5643774"

It is the responsibility of each member institution and the Association to act affirmatively to assure equity in the quality and quantity of participation in intercollegiate athletics. It is important that at the institutional level gender equity in intercollegiate athletics provides an environment in which a fair and equitable distribution of overall athletic opportunities, benefits, and resources are available to men and women, and in which student-athletes, coaches, and athletics administrators are not subject to gender-based discrimination.","The MIAA works with the Kansas City Sports Commission and VisitKC to promote this event. In addition to marketing through social media, flyers, etc., VisitKC has produced a video that is played during the pep rally to show the crowd a variety of tourist opportunities that Kansas City has to offer.

We seek out scripts by and about people who often have a more challenging time getting their works professionally produced.  In our search for socially provocative and artistically adventurous works, we engage emerging as well as established playwrights.  Unicorn Theatre is under the artistic and executive leadership of Producing Artistic Director Cynthia Levin who joined the company in 1979.  The company has produced 325 plays, which includes 65 world premieres. Annual Season: The Unicorn produces works that stimulate audiences to respond to, think about and discuss issues that surround ethnicity, gender orientation, race, and social justice. We strive to produce  not just the best new plays  but the best new important plays, works that say something that people should really hear.  To give audiences a chance to process as a group the issues raised in a play, we schedule several Talk Backs during each production.  Featured Fridays invite guests to come early and explore the context of the play through creative activities and presentations.

We maintain communications with the staff of VisitKC to participate in individual marketing and media initiatives as they arise. We distribute our season brochures, postcards and targeted appeals to the area hotels that host conventions and conferences. We forge connections with the coordinators of individual conferences and conventions that have a specific thematic, cultural or social link to our plays.  The Unicorn is frequently recognized in national industry magazines like American Theater.  Last year, an article appeared in the New York Times featuring the Unicorn.",,"We know from ticket sales that the Unicorn attracts guests from all over the metro area - about 50% come from the Missouri side, and 50% from the Kansas side.  The number that live in Kansas City, MO is approximately 4,000 out of 18,000+ guests last season.  The theater had attendees from 35 of the contiguous states, plus Hawaii.  States represented were: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Washington DC, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas (3,344), Kentucky, Missouri, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.  This is the case every year.  The Unicorn plays a significant role in the development of new works for the American stage and is known nationwide for high artistic standards and success in new play development.  This attracts people in the theatre industry to visit Kansas City to see Unicorn shows. The shows that the Unicorn produces are not widely available, so this entices more people to travel to Kansas City to see them. The Unicorn is recognized as a founding member of the National New Play Network and works with sister-theaters in every state to develop, produce and promote new plays. If a visitor to the city picked up a Unicorn brochure in their hotel, they would be see a list of plays that they had never seen - unless they lived in New York or another similar size city.  This will entice them to come.  They will see that we offer Pay What U Can on every weeknight - and this might appeal to their visit budget.  They would be impressed by the incredibly unique Unicorn approach to brochure design, one that won our design partners an international award and was highlighted in the New York Times.","The Unicorn is unique in the region by virtue of its dedication to producing new plays exclusively. Every theatre goer in Kansas City that is interested in current American theatrical works will be drawn to the Unicorn as the premiere venue to experience the best new plays being written today.To insure total access to the community, Unicorn Theatre offers Pay What U Can for half of all performances of all productions.  Guests may attend Tuesday - Thursday and pay what they can afford.  Last year 2,008 people who otherwise would not have been able to afford a ticket attended through Pay What U Can.  It has been the best method we have ever found to draw a young audience and a very diverse audience.","The project will draw 20,000 visitors over the course of the Season.  Businesses in the neighborhood (gas stations, bars, pharmacies, restaurants) will gain business from people who are drawn to the neighborhood for the Unicorn productions.  99% of the visitors will be from outside of the Olde Hyde Park Neighborhood.The Unicorn has been an advertisement for Midtown since it opened its doors on Main Street in 1986.  By consistently producing quality productions, partnering with surrounding institutions - such as the Nelson Atkins and Kemper Museum - the Unicorn has influenced the cultural draw of central KCMO.  The neighborhood has  improved with the participation of Unicorn Theatre. As the theater continues to thrive, more new businesses, restaurants and entertainment venues will locate on Main Street.   Traffic generated by the Unicorn encourages other businesses.  The neighborhood benefits as the type of businesses located in the area is elevated.The neighborhood will gain convenience in entertainment and shopping due to the Unicorn events and the businesses that locate on the Main Street Corridor. The Unicorn owns its building. This is a long-term commitment to the neighborhood and to its improvement. Having a business that owns its facility adds stability to the neighborhood. Businesses that thrive on the population attracted by the Unicorn will want to locate nearby.","To measure and fine tune the effectiveness of our ability to draw attendees to the Unicorn, we track the number of ticket purchases and seats filled every day, looking for trends or sudden highs or lows.  These help us modify our social media marketing on an almost immediate basis.  The ticketing software system we use is called Total Info. We gauge the success of a season by how many people purchase a season pass for the next season, by the % of seats filled and by whether any plays were extended. We can track the number of people who use Pay What U Can and the price they paid for their ticket. To evaluate the artistic success, the Unicorn's marketing department follows and reports on all critical reviews.","Every ticket buyer is recorded in our system with address and zip code.  This tells us how many are from outside the city. We can sort and get counts by zip code, city, whether a patron is a return guest and whether a guest is also a donor.  We also can pull the number of times a person has attended Unicorn plays and which ones.As far as racial demographics we can only estimate by observation.  Because of the Unicorn practice of looking for plays by women and playwrights of color, plays that focus on marginalized groups and plays that reflect the world today, we have a very diverse audience base.","POINT (-94.586061 39.057328)","39.0573488 -94.5865459"

This series of four to five concerts showcases the excellence of each BAS musician and delivers cutting-edge, experiential events that develop a wider audience for the arts. By choosing centrally located, free and unusual locations for concerts, BAS encourages diversity in its audiences. In 2014, BAS performed a free flash concert featuring famed cellist Matt Haimovitz in a West Bottoms nightclub. In 2015, BAS held a jam session at the Boulevard Brewery. In 2016, BAS performed a free concert in Loose Park, and in 2017 at the Kemper Museum of Modern Art. Holding concerts at the Public Library is another approach at inclusion. Library concerts are always free, and BAS has chosen this location for the last 5 years. The concerts are marketed through BAS and the library&#39;s website, with email blasts that reach thousands of people in every area of the metro each week. The 2018-2019 Season will include four public concerts, two of which will be presented at no charge. BAS Soloists, all based in Kansas City, are world-class musicians with international following. BAS attracts audiences from around the country and from around the globe. There are always a handful of international visitors at each major concert. To continuously reach new audience members, BAS regularly collaborates with other high-echelon local, national and international artists to present fascinating multi-genre performances. The ensemble is requesting funds from NTDF for marketing expenses for the 2018-2019 Season. BAS will draw visitors to four charming neighborhoods. The first two Community Concerts will be held in the Southmoreland Neighborhood at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, both free to the public. The third will be held in the Downtown Neighborhood at the Kansas City Central Library. This concert is also free, and will be able to accommodate 575 people. The fourth concert will be held at the Nelson-Atkins Museum. A special free concert celebrating Bach&#39;s birthday is also planned, and will be held in Kansas City, MO (venue TBD). Hauskonzerts are also open to the public, and held in some of Kansas City&#39;s most glorious homes.

BAS accomplishes its mission by: *Performing vocal and instrumental chamber music in intimate settings, the signature Hauskonzerts, and in community venues to encourage participation of diverse audiences. *Collaborating with world-class local, regional and national artists to provide multigenre programs inspired by Bach. *Bringing the brilliance of Bach to students through interactive BachReach programs, in-depth lecture/demonstrations and master classes in schools and other community settings.","BAS places online advertisements with VisitKC.com, an economic development organization dedicated to tourism, formerly the Kansas City Convention & Visitors Association. We maintain communications with the staff of Visit KC to participate in individual marketing and media initiatives as they arise. We distribute our season brochures, postcards and targeted appeals to the area hotels that host conventions and conferences. We forge connections with the coordinators of individual conferences and conventions whenever possible. BAS collaborates to draw new audience members and cross market between genres to offer fresh, inspiring performances; BAS selects convenient, centrally located venues and partners with various organizations in marketing. While the target audience for the Community Concerts is mainly adults of all ages, many young people attend these concerts. Marketing includes postcard mailings sent to all previous attendees of BAS concerts, newspaper and magazine ads, website announcements and eblasts, free and paid advertising. Recently, BAS has increased its usage of facebook and twitter. We also do &#34;street teaming&#34; and put brochures all across town (coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, churches, Visitkc, ArtsKC, store windows, etc). BAS also forms partnerships with area groups to help market concerts like the Asian American Chamber of Commerce, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and Friends of Jazz. Every Community Concert is a collaboration and an opportunity to reach out to groups such as these. The BachReach educational series is targeted to students and nontraditional audiences. BAS partners with schools and community organizations that serve children from low to moderate income homes, and seeks to reach students from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Through every collaboration, BAS seeks to introduce itself and its music to new audiences. Through partnership with: KC Public Library, all audience demographics; with Dr. Christoph Wolff the world&#39;s leading scholar on Bach, all Bach devotees; with HASF and other actors, BAS hopes to connect with theatre goers; with newEar, fans of contemporary music; with Owen/Cox or WylliamsHenry, with fans of contemporary dance. From Surveys done at previous collaborative concerts, we know that an average of 51 to 66% of attendees are new to BAS, and an average of 97% responded that they would attend another concert. National and international guests hear about BAS concerts from the BAS website, online calendars like VisitKC, word of mouth and many out of town guests are brought to BAS concerts by friends or family that they are visiting. Certain patrons that do business around the world frequently bring international guests.",,"Cultural tourism is the leading reason cited by travelers for visiting a community. BAS is exceptional in that each musician (Elizabeth Suh Lane, violinist; Elisa Williams Bickers, harpsichordist and Sarah Tannehill Anderson, soprano) is a world-class artist with extensive performance experience and an international following. Elizabeth Suh Lane is founder, Artistic Director, and solo violinist of BAS. She was a first violinist with the London Symphony Orchestra, and performs regularly with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She has fans who travel to KC from across the US to hear her perform with BAS. Elizabeth performs worldwide as a chamber, solo, and orchestral musician. She was a member of the two most recorded orchestras in the world: the London Symphony Orchestra and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields.  Sarah Tannehill Anderson, soprano, has performed with Opera Company of Philadelphia, Boston Lyric, Opera Omaha, Fort Worth Opera, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She is also a member of the Lyric Arts Trio and the Kansas City Chorale. Sarah is a featured soloist on the Chorale&#39;s Grammy Award winning album, Life and Breath. Elisa Williams Bickers is active nationally as a solo organist, continuo harpsichordist, and piano accompanist. She is a member of the National Guild of Organists.  Dr. Bickers was recently named to the select company of Fellows of the American Guild of Organists.  With around 50 Fellows in the U.S., Bickers is only the second Kansas City organist to be Fellow to be so honored. BAS partners with the finest local and international artists to form exciting collaborations that result in exciting, cross-genre artistic expression. These collaborations also attract audience members that are new to BAS but are familiar with the collaborating partner. So, not only will the international and national reputations of the ensemble draw visitors, the reputation and appeal of the collaborators draws audience as well.","Bach Aria Soloists has thrilled Kansas City audiences for 18 years, and has a wide following throughout Kansas City and the region - as the mailing database shows nearly every zip code is represented. As an example of the draw of the ensemble, 575 individuals typically fill the auditorium for the season&#39;s Community Concert held at the Central Library. The ensemble&#39;s Hauskonzert Series is always sold out every year. Bach Aria Soloists has been featured on KCPT&#39;s Arts Upload, which rebroadcasts and is on YOUTUBE, and BAS musicians are invited each year to appear on Kansas Public Radio and KCUR, thus attracting viewers/listeners from around the region to attend BAS&#39; concert series.  Also, each BAS musician is a leader in the artistic community, individually engages in other concerts and teaching, and has a wide circle of friends, peers and fans that follow BAS&#39; work.","Each neighborhood association will be acknowledged as a concert sponsor on the Funders page of the concert&#39;s program.","Each performance is evaluated artistically by the performers as a group, through ticket sales, audience comments, surveys and peer feedback. Surveys are included in the program of every concert. Critical reviews are tracked and any email communication or comments are recorded.","The geographic diversity and whether they are a new attendee of the audience is gleaned from tickets sale records.  Information on ethnic diversity is collected through audience surveys and by observation.",,

The family-friendly nature of the event  and free admission  draws an extremely broad cross-section of the populace. Kicking off the summer tourist season, Celebration offers a host of activities in and around Union Station, concluding with a free outdoor concert by the Kansas City Symphony and a fireworks display. A variety of local vendors set up booths at the event, offering a variety of food and beverages. Concertgoers bring blankets and set up chairs along the street and on the north lawn of Liberty Memorial for a memorable outdoor experience. Pershing Road is closed directly in front of the Station to extend the area available for seating. Family-oriented activities before the concert include the Symphonys popular Instrument Petting Zoo, which gives children the opportunity to experiment with musical instruments, face-painting, crafts, drumming circles led by a local percussionist, and displays by first-responders. As crowds gather, there is additional live musical entertainment from several local bands and an ensemble from the U.S. Air Force Band of Mid-America. Among this year's pre-concert entertainment is the Heartland Men's Chorus, performing a newly-commissioned work in partnership with the National WWI Musuem and sanctioned by the World War I Commission.  Led by the local Gold Star family chapters, photo montage walls will be placed inside Union Station, honoring Missouri and Kansas men and women who have died in service to their country since 2001. In addition, the National WWI Museum has exhibits and presentations that fit well with the event. Led by Music Director Michael Stern, the Kansas City Symphony performs directly in front of Union Station under a covered stage. A state-of-the-art sound and video system extends the experience to those concertgoers seated on the north lawn of Liberty Memorial. Imaginative lighting effects turn Union Station into an artists canvas, enhancing the musical experience. The program features familiar light classical pieces and patriotic works. Each year, we are very pleased to feature bands/ensembles that bring name recognition and variety to the event, ranging from local jazz greats Bobby Watson, Kevin Mahogany, and Oleta Adams to R&B vocalist Patti Austin, classical-crossover fiddler Mark O'Connor and the men of Musicorps. We are currently working on arrangements for this year's special guest artists. Narrator Jim Birdsall, the voice of Hallmark Hall of Fame and NFL Films typically serves as host for the program. The concert traditionally closes with a performance of Tchaikovskys 1812 Overture, complete with the rousing sound of live canons. Immediately following the concert, there is a spectacular fireworks display  one of the biggest and most dramatic in the Midwest  that lights up the sky over Liberty Memorial. Kansas City may be justifiably proud of this first-rate event.","4","4","Union Station","30 W. Pershing Rd","64108",,"Cultural","The event takes place in the Crown Center neighborhood.

Of course, there are ample opportunities for area residents to serve as volunteers on the day of the event.

Guided by past experience while searching for innovative and effective ways to communicate with potential concertgoers, the Symphony is working with its media partners, Spectrum and the local stations in the Cumulus group, to execute a campaign of radio and television advertising which will run during the three to four weeks before the concert. In addition, the Symphony is preparing for extensive exposure in The Kansas City Star and other print media in May of 2018, as well as billboards provided by CBS Outdoor. The Symphony looks forward tocontinuing its relationship with Bank of America as event lead sponsor. This partnership will facilitate contact with Bank of Americas customers and leverage its market visibility. The Symphony also coordinates planning and media campaign with local entities such as Visit KC, Economic Development Corporation, Downtown Council, Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department, National World War I Museum and Union Station. The Symphony also is working with KCPT-TV on production details for the live broadcast and planned July 4th rebroadcast by public television stations in 14 regional markets across Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Arkansas. There will be significant promotion of these broadcasts by local stations. Lastly, we will mount a coordinated social media campaign using email, Facebook, and Twitter. Sharing this program with ever-greater audiences is a key element of our mission. Because there are no conventions currently scheduled in Kansas City during Memorial Day weekend, we will focus efforts more on local and regional tourism.",,"Of surveyed attendees, 88% indicated that they came to Downtown Kansas City specifically for the event. People came from 70 ZIP codes in 56 communities (including 17 in KS, 23 in MO) in 12 states and Brazil. Half were in groups with children under 18 (who constituted 24% of the total number represented by the surveys). First-time attendees comprised 27% but a significant portion of the crowd had attended Celebration for an average of 7 years. The family-friendly nature of the event was cited by 63% as a main reason to attend. The appeal of a pops concert and fireworks were noted as the other top draws for the event. More than 45% of those surveyed indicated that the event was ""something fun to do"" on a holiday weekend and a substantial number of those respondents listed a ZIP code outside Greater Kansas City. Because the event takes place on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, families already visiting Kansas City would have incentive to stay for the program or add it to their list of activities since it is central to the weekend. Those families staying with relatives would be even more likely to join in the festivities as a family event. Given that many people travel on this holiday weekend at the start of the summer season, it is all the more likely that visitors in the area would be looking for entertainment and would take advantage of the opportunity to attend Celebration. Our survey noted tourists from California, Nebraska, Iowa, and Florida learned of the event by ""driving by,"" ""internet search,"" ""VisitKC website,"" and ""work.""  Significantly, 18% of non-KCMO residents surveyed, indicated that they had learned of the program through an internet search, suggesting that the event has strong appeal.  it also points to an important communication channel for publicizing the event.","Celebration has proven ability to attract Kansas City residents from other neighborhoods. Of the KCMO respondents at last years event, there were 18 ZIP codes represented outside of the events neighborhood. Whether an adjoining neighborhood or miles distant, this civic event has become a tradition in downtown Kansas City. Parking is relatively easy, the food and beverage options are affordable, the music is stupendous, the production itself is impressive, and the fireworks are an awesome way to start the summer season. The ease of streetcar transportation will especially enhance appeal for loft residents in the River Market, Library, Quality Hill, and Garment District areas. Additionally, streetcar access provides greater options for KCMO residents to attend the event AND explore downtown venues on the same day so surrounding neighborhoods may well benefit from the program.","The neighborhood is promoted by hosting a festive event that can be easily shared with family and friends, especially easy for neighborhood residents. Another benefit is that the event places an extremely low burden on surrounding areas in comparison to the size of attendance. Celebration's positive visibility and history of success adds to the benefits for the neighborhood, and with significant new residential space coming online in the area, bringing a large audience to the neighborhood promotes the livability of the area. This space in front of Union Station is now identified as a civic gathering point for people throughout Greater Kansas City, instantly recognizable and filled with positive connotations.","We measure success of Celebration by a variety of metrics. First and foremost, the program is evaluated by Music Director Michael Stern and the Symphony musicians as to whether the program and performance met the Symphony's exceptionally high artistic standards. Those standards are developed across a lifetime of practice and are viewed the lens of commitment to excellence. Other success indicators are number of people attending the program (estimated through crowd density analysis, parking utilization), audience quality of experience for all aspects of the event (assessed through comments received through social media, phone calls, and individual response), quality of the telecast with respect to sound and visuals (assessed in conjunction with the professionals at KCPT -- the 2017 Celebration telecast was nominated for a Mid-America Emmy Award), geographic reach of the telecasts (determined by location of stations airing the program) and the concomitant viewing audience, tourist draw (assessed by survey), and service to the Kansas City community (measured indirectly by number of responses and quality of feedback concerning the event).","For 2017 Celebration, we had Symphony volunteers survey a random selection of attendees inside Union Station, on the hill below Liberty Memorial, and throughout the concert venue. The survey included questions concerning home ZIP code, reasons for attending the event, influences on event attendance, size of group, and previous attendance at Celebration. We based the tourist estimate on the percentage of survey respondents listing a ZIP code outside KCMO (78%).We plan to use a similar approach for collecting data at the 2018 Celebration.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853282 -94.5855784"

Opening December 9th, audiences will once again enter the sound stage of KCMET radio station, to watch as the actors strive to save the radio station with their radio production of IT&#39;S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The production will run for 11 performances and approximately 1100 audience members from the greater Kansas City metro area and the Midwest region are expected to attend. We will also be partnering with local schools to expand cultural literacy & provide engaging theatre experiences for over 300 youth in our community, many of whom have never seen live theatre before. Each participating student receives a copy of the script for use in class for pre-show study and a site visit from a cast member prior to attending the show. We are partnering with Delta Woods Middle School to implement a Suicide Prevention program in conjunction with this production.  Familiar faces like Jordan Fox, Rebecca Ralstin, Cori Ann Weber, Alan Tilson, Chuck Pulliam, and Bob Paisley return to the stage under the direction of Metropolitan Ensemble Theatre&#39;s Producing Artistic Director Karen Paisley.

This clever stage adaptation breathes new life into the beloved story of George Bailey and Bedford Falls. Featuring live Foley sound effects, music, and a wonderful cast, this holiday classic rings with cheer. When Frank Capra and his co-writers were working on the original screenplay of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, the struggles of Great Depression were vivid memories. Over 60 years later, this story of personal redemption and community spirit remains as fresh and relevant as ever.

We are committed to four core values: access, artistry, innovation and excellence.","Kansas City is known for its huge offering of holiday and wintertime shows that make for the perfect way to spend an evening out to celebrate the season. MET is proud to have one of the hottest tickets in town to our 3rd annual holiday spectacular. Tied to the roots of the film, we have drawn audiences from all over the Midwest to brave the winter and join us for a night of heartfelt holiday theatre. Our first holiday season in the Warwick, we have community outreach programs planned to draw in more patrons to our enthusiastic audiences. We will be expanding our advertising efforts with this show to re-brand our space and draw in even more patrons. We post our season on event calendars that reach wide regional audiences, and each new season is posted on VisitKC.com. We are thrilled that NTDF posts MET plays on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks. MET is regularly featured in several different reviews by local and regional media outlets. We are regularly critiqued and covered in digital media including Broadway World Kansas City. Immediately before and during the plays run, we place ads in key media outlets within the range of our budget. This year, we have ads in room guides in four area hotels. The concierge at these hotels are given special tickets for tourists looking for a front row seat to some of Kansas Citys best theatre and will be adding radio spots on local radio stations. MET&#39;s lively social media platform is very effective in promoting our productions, now up to 4500 likes on our Facebook page. We use targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. In addition, we market the season and each play via Twitter, Instagram and on our own website. Local television and radio outreach promote each play, including television and radio interviews and ticket giveaways for radio stations. Staff, board members, cast members, and key volunteers distribute play-specific flyers to Midtown coffee shops and businesses and more broadly throughout the metropolitan area. Each play is advertised in our full-season flyer mailed in the fall and spring. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE will be advertised in all our Season 14 material, going out this fall. The list, generated from actual ticket sales over the years and expanded through a partnership with the Kansas City Rep, covers more than 52 counties of Missouri and Kansas as well as addresses from other states. Another 10,000+ mailing to theatre patrons is planned, which will feature the additional 8 plays of the 9-production season. MET places ads in programs passed out at other major arts performances for the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, the Kansas City Ballet, and New Theatre Restaurant. We market to unique audiences as well, identifying correlative interest groups who might enjoy specific performances. Growing our audiences and supporting this regional marketing effort is a major priority. As a sponsor of the season, NTDF will be mentioned as a presenting sponsor on all media.",,"MET seeks to attract adults, seniors, young professionals and students living in our region (within about a 3-hour drive of Kansas City) to our plays, and tourists and business travelers who may be here for a different reason but are attracted to our theatre. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City; they return again and again. Theatre lovers visiting the City for business or pleasure will find us because they like high quality, professionally produced plays. Intriguing themes or the opportunity to see a famous play will also attract the more casual theatre goer. Tickets (adult) average $30 each, affordable for most any pocketbook - are a good value for visitor dollars. Casually dressed visitors and patrons and those in evening wear mingle comfortably at our come-as-you-are venue. We believe METs online presence will be the primary avenue used to attract regional patrons or tourists/business travelers to one or more plays during the season. Each play will be listed in area print calendars and in online event calendars, such as the VisitKC.com website. We will place online ads in KC STUDIO magazine, Ink, and other digital outlets. We are also using targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. METs extremely lively social media platform produces great results, now up to 4,500 likes on our Facebook page, and we market via Twitter, Instagram and our own website. Online reviews of our plays during the run will be available at the Kansas City Star, The Pitch, Broadway World Kansas City. Travelers may also see promotional material in hotels or pick up a flyer distributed by staff and volunteers to local coffee shops or hotels. We are in the process of contacting tourism and business and leisure travel promotional organizations within a three-hour radius of Kansas City, to explore promotional opportunities in cities such as Des Moines, Omaha, Wichita, Lincoln, Joplin, Columbia and Topeka. Kansas City television and radio stations also cover a broad regional market, so our interviews and ticket giveaways will reach nearby smaller cities and towns. Our ads will be in programs passed out at other major arts performances (e.g. the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, etc.). Our marquee on the front of the Warwick receives 78,000 impressions each week from residents and visitors alike. NTDF ads on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks will promote the event to travelers as well.","Each MET season offers something for everyone of any age and from all walks of life. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is a holiday classic that appeals to audiences of all ages. Our target audiences include adults, young professionals, seniors and students. This show is perfect for corporate outings and has been utilized in the past for seasonal group events. METs 2018-2019 season covers a broad spectrum of palettes, for audiences that enjoy thought provoking plays to those that enjoy lighter material. We also represent our city on the stage by choosing pieces that reflect the cultural diversity of our community. Kansas City, Missouri residents and those from other metro area communities will attend because they wish to see a famous play or musical that they have never seen before, because they simply love professional theatre, or because something about a theme or subject intrigues them and they want to see what the play is all about. MET is also unique among local theatre companies given a combination of three features. First, we produce major masterworks and contemporary classics - plays or musicals that are award-winning and famous, but rarely produced in Kansas City because they are presumed to be too difficult or too expensive. Each season we offer an average of one play or musical premiere for Kansas City audiences. Second is trademark living room lobby, beautifully realized in our new home, the Warwick Theatre. Third is our intimate audience seating arrangement, with patrons within 3- 30 feet of the stage. We are excited to welcome our patrons and visitors to our new home; although it will look different, the experience will be the same familiar feeling they expect when coming to MET. Instead of a static stage and seating, the seating and stage change for each production. Audience members tell us they love these features, which is why it is so important to us to maintain them in the Warwick Theatre! MET offers extraordinary arts and culture experiences to the next generation. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE has served students in the past and will continue to recruit local school districts to bring their students for student matinees. We know that around 50% of students at our student matinees have never been to a live theatre performance. Perhaps some of these students will pursue theatre careers or become theatre lovers through student matinees. This show features an onstage Foley tour for audiences members to learn the ins and outs of these wonderful sound effects. This season we are expanding our marketing plan to use online and print ads in a variety of electronic and print publications, social media, mailings to our patrons and those of the theatre community in Kansas City, ads in programs of other Kansas City performing arts organizations and radio and television promotions. Promotional information was previously addressed.","The presence of MET at the Warwick anchors Midtown as a burgeoning live theatre district in KC, inviting the community to share the joy inspired by exceptional performers who bring extraordinary stories to life! We are thrilled to open Season 14 in the Warwick Theatre, our new home near 39th and Main. We have moved our staff, volunteer offices, and season of productions to inaugurate the first season held at the Warwick Theatre. In addition to bringing an exciting new venue online for theatre, art, and civic events, METs presence improves the safety of our neighborhood and increases visibility and traffic to the Midtown area all year long, making it a regular destination for returning patrons and drawing new visitors to our area. There are many new thriving businesses in our area; several of these are natural partners for our theatre. We are cross marketing with local restaurants, pubs, and hotels, as well as providing a pub atmosphere of our own. We are continuing our presence with VisitKC, as well. Old Hyde Park Historic District and MSCID/MainCor have each provided letters of support. While neither group will have a role in organizing or hosting the event, Old Hyde Park will promote the event at their neighborhood general meeting. SCID/MainCors mission does not include organizing or hosting other events. However, we have co-marketed with MainCor via a special discount code to their members for tickets. Old Hyde Park and MSCID/MainCor have been terrifically enthusiastic about our presence here on Main Street. In August, we are planning to have an event at the Warwick to bring together area businesses and to promote upcoming events. Getting to know everyone on a more personal basis will help encourage our ongoing collaboration. METs production of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE will run for 12 public performances, not only offering cultural opportunities for residents, but drawing visitors from other parts of the metro area and surrounding communities to the Old Hyde Park Historic District, to the Main Street Community Improvement District, and to other dining, music, and art venues in the District. Through conversations with our patrons we have been able to glean some valuable information about their leisure activities. We learned that slightly more than half of our audience visited local establishments (restaurants and taverns) before attending an evening show and around 37-40% went out after an evening performance. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City. MET is a strong contributor to Kansas Citys lively arts, cultural, and entertainment matrix. We are excited that as we grow, we contribute to the growth of our neighbors as well.","MET measures success in three ways: audience attendance, artistic excellence and patron participation. As noted above, we can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season and track where the patron lives. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster or other factor. Trends and correlations are regularly reported to our board and used to determine what works and what may need to be changed. Our analysis led to an expansion of the senior discount ticket to every performance this season, and introduction of a Young Professional (under 39) discounted, anytime ticket. These changes resulted in increased attendance from both groups. Artistic excellence is evaluated constantly to always achieve our artistic best. From selection of great plays, premieres and classics, casting exemplary artists, anchoring each production with a crack shot artistic team and bringing the best of our art form to the MET stage, to presenting our plays in the most dynamic ways possible, MET achieves artistic excellence. This commitment to excellence has paid off with a strong reputation for outstanding work and notable critical reviews from print and online reviewers, as well as frequent praise in social media posts. Audience behavior is a huge indicator of artistic success. Their engagement, participation and increased attendance in ancillary events created around the play indicates strong interest and appreciation for our work. We have a good track record of repeat attendance from first time attendees and many of them convert to season ticket holders. We also now have two dozen long-term partners, members of our audience who have purchased a lifetime ticket. Our volunteer base is continuing to grow and change with the renovation of the Warwick. We are seeing more participation from families and men. Audience talk back sessions following the last Thursday evening performance of a play is an increasingly popular method for our actors and audience members, plus theme experts when appropriate, to have a lively discussion around each plays topic. Social media traffic is an exceptional way for us to measure success. It encourages patron engagement through opportunities to ask thought-provoking questions, post educational information, show behind the scenes pictures and keep patrons up-to-date with show schedules. We have seen a drastic increase of social media traffic through the analytic updates sent to us by social media providers. Related to social media outreach, our audience has shown a significant increase of patrons 18-35 years of age. Social media is a fantastic platform to interact with audiences and has been shown to pique the interest of the 35-55 age demographic, as well.","MET currently uses the Vendini ticketing system through which we collect and store data on each ticket purchaser. When a ticket is sold online, the patron self-identifies as an adult, young adult (under age 39), senior, or student. Their name, address, and phone number are also recorded in the system, and of course the particular play or musical attended. Box office staff collects the same information when tickets are purchased over the phone or at the door and the information is entered into the Vendini patron database. Using Vendini data, MET can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season, and track whether the patrons lived in Kansas City, Missouri or in specific cities near or far away. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster, or other factor. The data allow us to conduct targeted marketing for future plays as well, such as mailings to patrons that appear to prefer comedies, dramas, or musicals. We estimate that approximately 1200 people will attend the entire run of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, including approximately 756 visitors from outside of Kansas City, Missouri. Based on analysis of 7,492 records in our Vendini database in June 2018, we know that 63% of past attendees came from outside of Kansas City, Missouri; and 2.2% came from states outside of Missouri and Kansas. We anticipate this trend to continue. Over the years, we have learned that each production at MET draws approximately 300 new patrons to the theatre on average. Many become return visitors or season ticket holders if they live close enough. Many others return a few times a season when in town on business travel but come often enough that we have learned their faces. However, most patrons come from Jackson County, Missouri and Johnson County, Kansas. We are continuing to see ongoing increases born of the initiative we put into motion in 2015-2016 to develop new audiences. We are particularly interested in growing our service to traditionally underserved communities and are pleased to see increases in those areas this season.","POINT (-94.586159 39.055705)","39.0556414 -94.5857322"

We've received rave reviews on the quality of event that Fiesta Hispana has become and they are constantly asking for other events. In the meantime, the GKCNHHC has promoted and sponsored other smaller events throughout the year: Tejano/Oldies Dance (March), Halloween (October), Tejano CD Release (July), and Pre-New Year's Eve (December) to help offset costs associated with Fiesta Hispana. Over the past couple of years, the GKCNHHC has also sponsored a special event every year that has raised funds for organizations and families in need. To date, we have raised funds for KKFI - 90.1 FM, Sacred Heart/Guadalupe Church (Westside area), Guardian Angels Church (Westport area), Esophageal Cancer Awareness (Ortega Family - Topeka, KS), and Mental Health Awareness/Suicide Prevention (Melgoza-Pecina Family, KCMO) - all totally over $50,000. During these events, all funds that are raised are donated directly to the individual/entity - GKCNHHC did not receive any portion of these proceeds. These events have served two purposes: (1) we are giving back to the community that does so much for Fiesta Hispana by attending our event annually, and (2) we are becoming a household name - individuals are realizing who we are as an organization and what our mission is. As people have become more familiar with our organization and events, they are constantly asking for more - specifically another Fiesta during the beginning of the season.  Our answer for them: FIESTA MEXICANA. Fiesta Mexicana 2018 will be almost identical to Fiesta Hispana. Fiesta Mexicana will present more than 75 professionally designed fiesta booths with food vendors selling a variety of authentic foods. Other booths will offer internationally imported jewelry, clothes, activities, consumer information, employment opportunities, health services, and more. Among these array of booths, there will also be a large children's area which will provide special activities for small children and their parents. Fiesta Mexicana will continuously feature two days of a wide variety of entertainment which will include Mexican folklore and dance, as well as, music from Mexico - with a wide variety ranging from Banda, Nortea, Cumbia, Duranguense, to Ranchera. We plan to use the success and audience of Fiesta Hispana to promote Fiesta Mexicana as a centralized location where individuals from all areas  can come together to celebrate the Mexican victory at the Battle of Puebla over the French on May 5th (Cinco de Mayo). We will reach out to the Consul Titular Alfonso Navarro Bernachi/Mexican Consulate's office to see if any activity/ceremony are performed in Mexico and/or throughout the United States at other offices.","4","4","Barney Allis Plaza, Downtown Kansas City, Missouri","Between 12th & Wyandotte / 12th & Central","64105",,"Cultural","Fiesta Hispana will take place in the Downtown neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri.","100000","40000","Annual","40000","21145","21145","180272","The Greater Kansas City National Hispanic Heritage Committee Inc.'s mission is to promote wide recognition and appreciation for the significant role and contributions of Hispanics in the development of the United States through promoting cultural, educational and economic development advancement of the Hispanic community.","The Greater Kansas City National Hispanic Heritage Committee Inc. will register Fiesta Mexicana with the Kansas City Convention & Visitor Bureau/Visit KC to promote Fiesta Mexicana as one of the main attractions of the Kansas City area during this period of time to visitors looking to visit the area. This event will be promoted through various forms of media: local radio, TV, newspaper/magazine, Facebook, etc. with the intent of reaching local, regional, and national audiences. Promotional posters, flyers, billboards, etc. will also be distributed throughout the Kansas City metro area and its surroundings. Our plan is to promote Fiesta Mexicana the exact same way that Fiesta Hispana is promoted.

Fiesta Mexicana will be one of the few events in the Midwest that features National Hispanic/Latino entertainment and does not charge any admission during any of the 2 days that the event takes place. The GKCNHHC have made it their mission to provide a quality fiesta that is family oriented and FREE for all to attend. Fiesta Mexicana will feature national entertainment that do not perform in the area. They are artists that people would not be able to see unless they were to travel to other cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, San Antonio, etc. The ultimate goal is to make Fiesta Hispana and Fiesta Mexicana as the ""PREMIER HISPANIC FIESTAS"" (or even CONCERT SERIES!) so that people from all over the Midwest plan their family vacations to Downtown Kansas City, Missouri specifically to attend the events and to enjoy what KCMO has to offer. For those individuals that live in KCMO, our goal is to have Fiesta Mexicana and Fiesta Hispana be the events that EVERYONE wants to attend and be a part of - there would not be any reason for them to travel to other states to see the quality of entertainment that we are providing, thus leading them to reinvest those dollars in the City of KCMO by staying at local hotels and patronizing local establishments.","Fiesta Mexicana will appeal to persons living in Kansas City, Missouri and to those that do not live in the area.

We are giving individuals another reason to attend an event in Downtown Kansas City - the more opportunities an individual is given to visit a location, the more they are likely to continue to frequent the location and to explore the area around it. In the short-term, area merchants will benefit by monetary sales during the 2-day fiesta at the various hotels, restaurants, drinking establishment, and parking garages. In the long-term, as Fiesta Mexicana and Fiesta Hispana continue to grow, it will continue to provide a steady stream of new clients to the Downtown area and its establishments. Fiesta Hispana 2017 had a record year in attendance and sales. Individuals from the states of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Texas attended Fiesta Hispana during its 3 days - Fiesta Mexicana will keep the momentum going and provide individuals another wonderful opportunity to keep them coming to Downtown Kansas City. Having two events throughout the year will keep Fiesta Hispana/Fiesta Mexicana/Downtown Barney Allis Plaza fresh in their minds throughout the whole year - not just as Hispanic Heritage Month approaches.","Included in the above mentioned survey, there will be an overall area of customer service satisfaction and the likelihood if they would attend the event next year, and the likelihood if they would recommend the Fiesta to any of their friends and family. Customer satisfaction is the most important part of Fiesta so that  individuals will continue to attend all of our events in the future - we also want them to spread the word by sharing via social media how wonderful it was to attend Fiesta. This has been very effective in the growth of Fiesta Hispana in the past years and we are hoping this will continue with the addition of Fiesta Mexicana.","Data will be collected by online surveys, social media responses, and data collected by volunteers during the event. Attendees of Fiesta Mexicana will be able to go onto Fiesta's website, Facebook page, and thru an online link to fill out a survey about the different areas of the Fiesta (i.e. booths, children's area, entertainment, etc.) so that the Board can receive honest feedback from those in attendance. We will use this information to make Fiesta better each year.Information to be collected from these surveys include: age group, area they are from, ethnicity, how they heard about Fiesta, likelihood that they will spread the word, what they liked the most, areas for improvement, and if they would return next year.",,"37.09024 -95.712891"

So much surrounds the Concourse Park and is worth visiting too.  The most grand front porch the 1910 Colonnade is across from the Concourse Fountain.  The Kansas City Museum is two blocks away. The Cliff Drive Scenic Byway skirts the north side of Concourse Park and historic mansions line Gladstone Blvd.  A Hill Slide is just West of the fountain and a new play ground.

This is followed by a 3-4-hour show of dancing, singing, lion dances, drumming, magicians, acrobatics, skits, and martial arts performances.  Every effort is made to make the festival a fun-filled and educational day for the entire family based on authentic Asian traditions.   The opening ceremony features remarks from members of the Kansas City City Council, the Consul General of the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, Society Board members and other honored guests. Arts and crafts activities and fun competitions take place at the Cafe Corner for the children and adults.  Children with small boats run a simulated race in anticipation of the real event on the water.  Booths offer Chinese souvenirs, jewelry, Dragon Boat  T-shirts, face painting, balloon figures and dragon parasols.  Other booths offer calligraphy demonstrations, Festival programs, information about Chinese friendship organizations, and about the Kansas City Sister-City relationship with Xian and Yan'an, China.  Food trucks add to the festivities and offer Asian food and shave ice. At the same time, the 12-14 rowing teams are practicing and preparing for the races to begin.  The sidewalk along Brush Creeks and the Sister Cities Bridge, decorated with Chinese Lanterns and banners provide good places to watch the races that begin at 10:00 and run until the first, second, and third place winners are determined for the collegiate and community divisions.   After the races, the fun continues with additional presentations on stage by Chinese performers and an awards ceremony for the winning teams.  For the 14th anniversary of the Festival we expect professional artists from Xian, China and a dragon boat racing team from the city of Ankang, China.

This goal is achieved through cultural events such as the annual Dragon Boat Festival that informs the greater Kansas City community about the culture, arts, and heritage of China and helps the Chinese living in the Kansas City area learn more about American and Kansas City culture. The Society seeks to develop ongoing connections between Kansas City and cities in China, to attract tourists to this city, and to expand exchange opportunities between both areas.","The Society will work with Visit KC and the Office of Culture and Creative Services to be listed on city wide announcements.  We make certain that our event is on Eventbrite, our website, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, KC Parent and KC Studio.  We contract for KC Star online advertising and will use KCUR radio ads in 2018.  Posters and fliers are placed in libraries and community centers.  Since the event occurs near the Country Club Plaza, we distribute fliers to the neighborhood hotels and to the Plaza information office to make certain that visitors are aware of the event.","All contiguous neighborhood Associations are invited to participate in the Festival, to volunteer for its activities, and/or to organize a team for the competition on the creek.  At this time we do not have specific commitments from the neighborhood associations but we will continue to offer opportunities for involvement.  We ask the neighborhood groups to help us publicize the Festival.  We send announcements to 7 neighborhood organizations (Crestwood, 49-63, and Rockhill in addition to those listed above) informing them of the Festival and inviting their participation. Because the event is free, we believe it is a good opportunity for families to enjoy the day's entertainment without expense.","This is an unusual activity and both the races and the entertainment provide an interesting day for those already in the area.  The Country Club Plaza has several tourist hotels and it is easy for these visitors to hear about and to access the Festival because of their proximity to it. Dragon boat races are popular throughout the US (and Asia) and are being discussed as a new entry for the Olympic games.  Teams come from Lawrence and Manhattan, Kansas and from St. Louis and they recruit supporters to attend the Festival.","Publicity is done city-wide.  Kansas City residents enjoy coming to the Plaza for outdoor events and have an interest in Chinese culture.  We use social media, produce fliers, and work hard to get news coverage for the event.  The event is free of charge, has activities for various ages, and is a unique event in the city.  There are many dragon boat festivals throughout the country, especially on the east and west coasts, but Kansas City has the only dragon boat races on a ""creek.""  Food trucks and competition among colleges and community groups encourages an audience.  Teams are encouraged to invite their supporters and are part of the publicity plan.","The event showcases the interesting neighborhoods that surround the Plaza and brings people from the suburbs, surrounding towns and communities, and other areas to this part of the city. The event also showcases the Chinese and other Asian communities which re spread throughout the city, but share a common culture.  In addition to learning more about Chinese culture, we hope this event will help neighbors get to know and enjoy each other.  Small shops in the area should benefit from the increased foot traffic.  This Festival is one of many sponsored in part  by the Kansas City Sister Cities Association and it reinforces Kansas City's connections around the world.","Success is primarily measured by attendance and satisfaction on surveys.  In 2017 our racing teams increased to 14 and team supporters were noticably present for the races.  Attendance at the entertainment section was strong and remained active throughout the day.  Surveys revealed high satisfaction but also helpful suggestions for future events.  Some input was gathered via Twitter and Instagram which we used for the first time in 2017.","We are aware of tourists from China, Chicago, Dallas, Lawrence, KS, Manhattan, KS, and St. Louis who attend each year and who are in contact with the festival staff prior to the event.  Many from the Chinese  and other communities in the surrounding KC suburbs of both Missouri and Kansas also are known to us through their participation in the festival and contributions to it.  From interactions at the Information booths, we also know that guests in area hotels attend, but those numbers are not firm.  Our audience demographic data are largely anecdotal but we do try to count participants from various positions at various times of day during the festival.  Food and other vendor sales offer some insight. Evaluation cards are also used and yield some information.  Demographic questions will be added for 2018.

The Alumnae chapter is made up of over 300 plus college-educated, professional women in thegreater Kansas city area. Stepping and the step show have long standing history with greek sororities and fraternities acrosscollege campuses and extending into graduate chapters across the US. Stepping or step-dancing is a form of percussive dance inwhich the participant's entire body is used as an instrument to produce complex rhythms and sounds through a mixture of footsteps,spoken word, and hand claps. Though stepping may be performed by an individual, it is generally performed by groups of three ormore, often in arrangements that resemble military formations. The tradition of stepping is rooted within the competitive schoolyardsong and dance rituals practiced by historically African American fraternities and sororities, beginning in the mid-1900s. Thesecompetitions are now held throughout the United States on a competitive basis...some for money and some simply for braggingrights. DEED has partnered with KCMO Alumnae chapter of Delta Sigma Theta (DST) to hold a regional competition here that includes undergraduate and graduate chapters of fraternities and sororities. The Kansas City Missouri Alumnae chapter has won national step show competitions so is positioned well to host and attract step teams to this competition from the Midwest. Historically, teams come from within in Missouri including St. Louis, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to compete. These areas are a natural outreach as Kansas City sits in the Central Region within its national organization. The national recognition of the KCMO alumnae chapter along with the support of the other 8 National Panhellenic Greek Organizations provide a platform of participants to draw from on the collegiate and graduate levels. Teams which generally consist of 8-12 individuals plus supporting casts are provided with a theme and generally practice for months in preparation for the show. The event will usually host 8-10 teams with the teams bringing 25+ people with them, including the team, supporting cast and chapter members. The teams are judged by local and regional selected judges with include community leaders, business professionals, and entertainers. The evening is hosted by a radio personality or entertainer. The Kansas city Missouri Alumnae Chapter performs as entertainment during the show. The stepshow is a drawing for the entertainment factor plus an opportunity to socialize among alumnae from across the region. The funds are used to support the general scholarship fund for the DEED foundation. The foundation has awarded over $1M in scholarship funds and supports ongoing youth and community programming.","4","4","Historic Folly Theatre","300 W. 12th Street","64105","none","Cultural","300 w. 12th street, kansas city, MO 64105 - Downtown Neighborhood Association","1500","400","Annual","6300","4000","4000","180272","The mission of the foundation is to strengthen and expand economic stability of the Kansas City urban community and  help empower youth, women and families in the community through educational and economic development.

In addition, the people who travel here come for myriad of reasons. The step teams use it as form of expression and comrade in entering and coming to Kansas city for the step show. Kansas city has a reputation of having the best of the best, so teams in the region make it a priority to enter and perform in Kansas city. The teams bring upwards of 25+ people to the city per team including those actually stepping, the supporting cast and members from their affiliation. Kansas city also serves as a central hub for the colleges and alumnae chapter in this region. People also travel to see a local chapter such as Kansas City MO alumnae perform. As a nationally acclaimed team, it is an opportunity for those visiting the city to see the team.  In 2017, participants traveled by charted bus from Omaha Nebraska and St. Louis Missouri.  In addition, step teams participated from across the Missouri and Kansas state lines.","Step shows and stepping have been popular nationally on college campuses for decades, leaving memories for those who have attended college to take with them wherever they may be; it's generational....sororities and fraternities have created legacies formany generations...and it knows no geographic boundaries as hit shows like Different World and movies like Drumline and Stomp the Yard have showcased the art of stepping on the big screen. It's an art form...so whether, you are in a greek organization or not, people are intrigued by the art...and appreciate an art form, particularly in the African-American culture. For persons living in Kansas City, the Burning Sands step show represents an annual opportunity to take in a show. A show that has the basis of dance and music as art forms. The most popular step routines have been passed down, and many of the songs are still used and housed in each Fraternity's and Sorority's history archives. Many times a step performance ends or incorporates the use of a chant that is associated with the respected organization. A chant is a song that is worded or has a rhythm specific to that organization. Each particular organization has their own. In addition to the Art form, this provides an additional social outlet for persons living in Kansas city. This is a time for reunions for those who may have attended colleges in the Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Kansas region.","Just like other cultural and arts event hosted at the Folly Theatre, the step show will indirectly promote the registered neighborhood by driving people to the downtown area and the historic theatre. The step show provides for a diverse event and audience to be in the Folly theater and to grab a bite to eat at one of the local deli or restaurants in the area before and after the show. Or perhaps to stay at one of several hotels in the 5 block radius of the theater.  Diversity in this case provides for varied economic, social along with inter generational diversity.  All of these efforts of promotion, which DEED will do, will help support, drive to and promote the registeredneighborhood.","The event success is measured on multiple levels including: 1) Number of teams registered 2) Number of persons attending/purchasing tickets to the stepshow 3) The amount of money contributed to the scholarship fund.

The target audience includes affluent Metroarea residents who have a philanthropic spirit and who believe in the power of people to revitalize communities through community gardens. Approximately 25% of the events attendees reside within the affluent Johnson County, Kansas. KCCG seeks to increase attendance from Johnson County through expanded event promotion. Gardens at Sunset features food from local restaurants that have a similar interest in ensuring access to healthy food for all Kansas City residents. In 2017, food offerings included Fiorellas Jack Stack BBQ Beef Burnt Ends, bluestem goat cheese gougeres, Urban Caf KC Vegan Chickpea Tacos (this restaurant actually sources their ingredients from a KCCG community garden!), and Heirloom Bakery + Hearth Cheesecake and Brownie bites. Guests are encouraged to browse and bid on unique auction items while they mingle. The most beloved feature of the event is the setting in Kansas Citys historic Swope Park. Gardens at Sunset is designed to take place during the gardens most beautiful time of year. Guests gasp with wonder as they enter, taking in the golden glow of the lush garden during the suns setting hours. The main program includes engaging stories of KCCG's work in the community. Gardens at Sunset ends with a fun and lighthearted live auction, called Raise the Rake. Attendees shout with enthusiasm, raising rakes as they pledge their financial support to the organization. Gardens at Sunset is becoming increasingly important to KCCG as a significant source of income, because the organization has had to expand its staff in recent years to continue meeting the need for gardening services in Kansas City. The Neighborhood Tourism Development Fund (NTDF) generously provided KCCG with $2,500 for the event in 2017, and the money was well spent: KCCG increased its earnings by 87% while decreasing its overall expenses. A $5,000 contribution from the NTDF for 2018 would be a catalyst for KCCG to further expand Gardens at Sunset.

Boulevardia was created as a small country with big ambitions. Using a ""world within a city"" theme, Boulevardia seeks to bring together creative people, entrepreneurs, and community leaders to develop and showcase ideas that can propel our community forward towards a brighter future. Utilizing these ideas and executing them in an urban street fair environment, Boulevardia features music, entertainment, food, beer, art, environmental awareness, local commerce, cycling and charitable causes, creating social engagement and enrichment. Boulevardia is driven largely by community, striving to make a difference in the community that supports us and celebrating that bond, believing that together we can make a big impact. We continue to focus on:- Providing opportunities to cultivate local partnerships; from fresh, local food elements to artisans, designers, vendors and business relationships- Eco-urban thinking and promoting the value of green initiatives in all aspects of daily life- Education of the craft beer industry and the business and community impact these breweries deliver- Developing and cultivating opportunities for leadership, community outreach and volunteerism- Deepening a sense of community among Kansas Citians through the promotion of our city's unique flavors and culture and contributing to the great vitality of the great midwest","In 2017, Boulevardia welcomed guests from 44 different states and in just four years, Boulevardia has had attendees from 49 different states and nearly a dozen countries worldwide. In our first four years, outside of Missouri and Kansas, Boulevardia has welcomed 3,581 visitors from Illinois, 903 visitors from Texas, 485 visitors from California, 412 visitors from Nebraska, 342 visitors from Michigan, 318 visitors from Minnesota, 317 visitors from Colorado, 272 visitors from New York, 264 visitors from Iowa, 257 visitors from Oklahoma, 222 visitors from Tenessee, 216 visitors from New Jersey, 213 visitors from Florida and hundreds more from other states around the country. Each year our audience base grows, building acclaim from those visiting Kansas City for Boulevardia and promoting a positive image for the City of Kansas City and the culture, amenities, history, and entertainment associated with this city and this event. When you combine the tourism appeal of Boulevardia with the community-involved vendors at the event, the short-term and long-term impact of to the community is incredibly positive.Our promotions and marketing campaign includes a heavy focus locally and regionally and because of our ability to welcome very unique breweries and musicians from around the country, our audiences come from around the country to participate in this festival. Visit KC has assisted with the event in recent years and Boulevardia is also a member of the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), of which it has received worldwide acclaim, including the 2016 Pinnacle Awards, where Boulevardia received 2nd Place Overall for best festival in the world in its budget category. Boulevardia presents seminars at IFEA and other unique conferences and conventions throughout the region and has become a major focus point for festival operators around the country. Together we are able to utilize these unique channels to promote this event and encourage tourism to Kansas City and Boulevardia for this special event.",,"In four years, our audience has welcomed over 150,000 guests. In those four years, we've welcomed guests from 49 different states, including 44 alone in 2017. Those attendees visit from major cities across the United States, turning Kansas City into a tourism destination for this event alone. Our music lineup includes incredible national headliners and a long list of up and coming musicians. Our beer is inclusive of breweries from across the country and even a few international breweries, who garner critical acclaim within the beer industry and get people to travel to Kansas City for this event. This is a signature event happening in Kansas City, Missouri that has received national recognition, including major awards from the American Advertising Federation and International Festival and Events Association. Kansas City is appealing as a standalone destination and when you add in the irresistible joy of Boulevardia's amenities and entertainment it becomes a blockbuster pairing!","Boulevardia is a celebration of all things Kansas City. Our community outreach is not only geared to showcase what Kansas City is like for those who don't live here, our outreach is designed to showcase all the incredible things we have here TO those people that live here. Very rarely does a community event showcase so many local entertainers, vendors, food trucks, artisans and organizations in one place. Boulevardia brings everyone together to feature Kansas City and support Kansas City and our outreach within the community is a major driving force behind the success of the festival. We try to stay deeply connected to our community and offer an extensive list of local items, while also featuring new, exclusive things each and every year. Kansas City supports its own and by promoting these great partners at our event, it drives the community to Boulevardia to discover more each and every year. In 2017, our event featured 29 local Makers Market artisan vendors, 16 local food trucks and restaurants, 33 local musicians and performance groups and 12 bars staffed by local volunteer organizations. No other event brings it all together like Boulevardia and this unique celebration creates an incredibly appealing event for those in the Kansas City, Missouri area.","We work closely with the West Bottoms Business Association and the Stockyards District tenants to implement this event. We created custom signage and marketing materials to give to each tenant / business last year and we had them utilize that in helping to promote the event and their involvement. Careful consideration is taken to work with all tenants, vendors and businesses in the impacted footprint and together we work to promote the event and in turn, benefit the neighborhood. In each year of Boulevardia, many of the businesses in the neighborhood were either directly involved in the event, provided tickets to the event for their tenants/guests or opened up their doors exclusively for the event weekend. With over 70 different community vendors involved in the event, Boulevardia has a long-lasting impact for the neighborhood we hold the event in AND the neighborhoods that are the permanent homes for the vendors we feature at Boulevardia. Many vendors, food trucks, artisans and entertainers get discovered by new patrons each year at Boulevardia and are sought out after the event, continuing the benefit across the community and creating positive success for all involved.","We utilize Visit KC to help conduct surveys at our festival along with our own individual post-event surveys given to event attendees digitally. We also request input through our website and email on ways to improve the festival experience. With the data we are given through those channels and our online ticket sales, the feedback we can generate is useful because we have a direct voice to our fans. In the surveys we've conducted, less than 2% of attendees have indicated a desire NOT to return. That means 98% of our attendees are happy with their experience at Boulevardia. Ticket sales have increased each year. We continue to gather attendees from more and more states and cities. We also have a tremendous retention rate amongst our vendors, including our food vendors and volunteer organizations. The event is often considered a can't miss and that is because our vendors and organizations experience great success during the event. That doesn't mean we'll stop trying to improve. Each year we strive to improve the festival experience for our attendees and make it better. The success of our event is also measured financially. Boulevardia strives to be able to operate in a positive financial manner and manage budgets and finances properly each year. Our event is susceptible to volatile weather situations that we can't control but if we can effectively manage our budgets to set us up for long-term success while providing positive experiences for attendees we measure that success in a positive manner.","Our online ticket sales represented 44 different states and 14 different countries in 2017. In terms of knowing how many individuals came from outside of Kansas City, Missouri, we are able to see the number of tickets that came from outside of KCMO in our online event reports. We receive attendee reports for online sales and can track the orders made from out of state attendees. That also doesn't include on-site sales which would likely bolster these numbers even more. Additionally, our bands and breweries promote their appearances at Boulevardia in Kansas City, Missouri to their followers, many of whom are located throughout the country. Our social media impact generates millions of impressions annually and all of them generate the interactions we hope for to drive out of state audiences to Kansas City, Missouri for this event.","POINT (-94.604924 39.0949)","39.0945871 -94.6051346"

Last year we hosted only one Movie Night, but it was such a great success that this year we would like to expand to hosting four. In order to make this as cost effective as possible while also increasing the number of Movie Nights to four, we will choose less expensive movies for three of the four nights. Before the movie we will feature performances by youth bands, orchestras, or choirs. We have budgeted to pay youth bands for two of the nights but are hoping to find two more who will donate their time. We also are proposing a partnership with KC Parks to lower the permit fees from $175 for each night ($700 total permit cost) to $175 total. Refreshments will be served.

While the Northeast News primarily serves residents of northeast Kansas City, The Pitch is available locally in area establishments where tourists are likely to be found, including in machines at the Streetcar stops.

Weather is usually dry and warm, and everyone is relaxing into new school routines. What better way to entertain the kids on the cheap than a free movie in the park on a Saturday night? And when that movie is a family film, everybody wins. This is the perfect time of year for families to get outside into our KC Parks to spend time together. Plus, the youth bands or choirs that will be performing will be of great interest and a source of motivation for kids attending this event.","This event will help visitors to Kansas City and specifically northeast Kansas City see how family-friendly it can be. By encouraging positive use of the neighborhood park, we are promoting a more positive image for the neighborhood. It is purely a volunteer-staffed event, so it will be neighbors helping neighbors instill community. The more people who visit Pendleton Heights for family fun at a movie night, the more people see them. The more people see families in the park and outside in the neighborhood, the more they understand that this is not a place to litter or loiter in destructive ways. Instead, it seems more like a place that young families will want to make their homes. They will visit for movie night and realize we have a great location, beautiful view, historic architecture, several quality school options, and dedicated neighbors.","During the event, at our information table, we will ask people to fill out comment cards: is this event convenient for them? Is the movie an appealing choice? Could we do something to make this more fun? What would you like to see at this kind of event next year? Would you be out in Kessler Park tonight if not for this event? When's the last time you visited Kessler Park? At the end of an event we ask ourselves, ""What went well tonight? What could we improve? Did we have any injuries or security issues? If so, could they have been avoided? How well attended was our event? Did we meet our attendance goal? Did families seem to enjoy themselves? Did we have enough refreshments? Was the movie easily visible and easily heard? What would we do differently next year?""","We will set up an information table to explain our event, and we will ask people to let us know how many people are in their group, if they have children, if they live in Kansas City, and how they heard about our event. We will also ask for race, gender, and age, if they wish to give that information. It will all be kept anonymous.","POINT (-94.555456 39.113754)","39.1137704 -94.5554767"

The season will include a total of 104 performances for all plays and the musical, including 13 evening and weekend performances per play/musical and a total of 8 student matinees for the season. Projected season attendance at all performances is 8,000 patrons. Each play or musical comes with a pedigree of critical acclaim, such as a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright or Tony Award winner. MET has a thirteen-year tradition of presenting dynamic intimate productions of timeless masterworks and contemporary classics, many of them Kansas City premieres, or in the case of great classic works, not seen in a generation. MET has become the go-to location to see a classic play or musical. Season selections ensure a mix of American and world/European masterworks, contemporary classics, musicals, and lighter dramas or comedies. Our capital campaign to renovate the Warwick is underway and initial pledges have been secured. The building is slated to be renovated in two phases. Phase One addresses life health safety requirements to gain an initial occupancy permit. Phase Two fully outfits the Warwick as a professional theatre and community asset. We are thrilled to be planning our fourteenth season for presentation in the historic Warwick Theatre. THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN this spring June 7-17, 2018 will round out our 13th season. Made popular by the unforgettable performance of the late Debbie Reynolds, the musical captures the singular spirit, indomitable optimism, and Midwestern pluck personified in the title character. An old-fashioned, high-kicking, song and dance musical, this production is suitable for the entire family.  Six additional plays will be produced from Sept. 2018 through April 2019.

MET exists to share access to the great works of theatre with all people in our community, to inspire creativity, to encourage a culture of inclusion, to empower individuals, and build community through the transformational power of the arts. We are committed to four core values: access, artistry, innovation and excellence.","We post our season on event calendars that reach wide regional audiences, and each new season is posted on VisitKC.com. We are thrilled that NTDF posts MET plays on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks. MET is regularly featured in both Kansas City Star and Pitch print and online media. We advertise in KC STUDIO magazine (kcstudio.org and print), The Kansas City Jewish Chronicle, and are regularly critiqued and covered in digital media including Broadway World Kansas City and KCMETROPOLIS.org. We also advertise in online and print versions of Ink magazine. Immediately before and during the plays run, we place ads in key media outlets within the range of our budget (e.g. Ink, Kansas City Star). METs lively social media platform is very effective in promoting our productions, now up to 4300 likes on our Facebook page. We use targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. In addition, we market the season and each play via Twitter, Instagram and on METs own website. Local television and radio outreach promotes each play, including television and radio interviews and ticket giveaways for radio stations. Staff, board members and key volunteers distribute play-specific flyers to Midtown coffee shops and businesses and more broadly throughout the metropolitan area. They also do tabling at local festivals and neighborhood events. METs Main Street Billboard featuring each show receives more than 78,000 impressions each week. Each play is advertised in our full-season flyer mailed in the fall and spring. THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN has been advertised in all our Season 13 material and runs June 7-17. The list, generated from actual ticket sales over the years and expanded through a partnership with the Kansas City Rep, covers more than 52 counties of Missouri and Kansas as well as addresses from other states. Another 10,000+ mailing to theatre patrons is planned for the spring of 2018, which will feature the additional 6 plays of the 7-production season. MET places ads in programs passed out at other major arts performances for the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, the Kansas City Ballet and New Theatre Restaurant. We market to unique audiences as well, identifying correlative interest groups who might enjoy specific performances. For example, we will contact local LGBTQ groups who may be interested in GROSS INDECENCY: THE THREE TRIALS OF OSCAR WILDE and THE LARAMIE PROJECT, to be produced Oct. 18-Nov. 4, 2018. Both of these plays follow the persecution of homosexual individuals and how their stories have contributed to the shift in our culture. Growing our audiences and supporting this regional marketing effort is a major priority. Two part-time staff members assist with our efforts, and two full-time employees support our marketing efforts and provides the creative material for audience development efforts. As a sponsor of the season, NTDF will be mentioned as a presenting sponsor on all print and digital media.",,"MET seeks to attract adults, seniors, young professionals and students living in our region (within about a 3-hour drive of Kansas City) to our plays, and tourists and business travelers who may be here for a different reason but are attracted to our theatre. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City. Theatre lovers visiting the City for business or pleasure will find us because they like high quality, professionally produced plays. Intriguing themes or the opportunity to see a famous play will also attract the more casual theatre goer. Tickets (adult) average $35 each  affordable for most any pocketbook - are a good value for visitor dollars. Casually dressed visitors and patrons and those in evening wear mingle comfortably at our come-as-you-are venue. We believe METs online presence will be the primary avenue used to attract regional patrons or tourists/business travelers to one or more plays during the season. Each play will be listed in area print calendars and in online event calendars, such as the VisitKC.com website. We will place online ads in KC STUDIO magazine, Ink, and other digital outlets. We are also using targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. METs extremely lively social media platform produces great results, now up to 4,300 likes on our Facebook page, and we market via Twitter, Instagram and our own website. Online reviews of our plays during the run will be available at the Kansas City Star, The Pitch, Broadway World Kansas City and KCMETROPOLIS.org. Travelers may also see a print ad or review in the Kansas City Star, Ink or The Pitch; or pick up a flyer distributed by staff and volunteers to local coffee shops or hotels. We are in the process of contacting tourism and business and leisure travel promotional organizations within a three-hour radius of Kansas City, to explore promotional opportunities in cities such as Des Moines, Omaha, Wichita, Lincoln, Joplin, Columbia and Topeka. Kansas City television and radio stations also cover a broad regional market, so our interviews and ticket giveaways will reach nearby smaller cities and towns. Our ads will be in programs passed out at other major arts performances (e.g. the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, etc.). Our billboard at 36th and Main receives 78,000 impressions each week from residents and visitors alike. NTDF ads on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks will promote the event to travelers as well. THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN has already been marketed via a 10,000+ area theatre patron mailing in the fall of 2017, and is being marketed on our website and Facebook page. Another 10,000+ mailing to theatre patrons is planned for the spring of 2018, which will feature the other 6 plays to be produced during the 2018-2019 NTDF grant year plus the musical that falls in the next NTDF grant cycle.","Each MET season offers something for everyone of any age and from all walks of life. Our target audiences include adults, young professionals, seniors and students. METs 2018-2019 season covers a broad spectrum of palettes, for audiences that enjoy thought provoking plays to those that prefer something lighter. We also represent our city on the stage by choosing pieces that reflect the cultural diversity of our community. Kansas City, Missouri residents and those from other metro area communities will attend because they wish to see a famous play or musical that they have never seen before, because they simply love professional theatre, or because something about a theme or subject intrigues them and they want to see what the play is all about. MET is also unique among local theatre companies given a combination of three features. First, we produce major masterworks and contemporary classics - plays or musicals that are award-winning and famous, but rarely produced in Kansas City because they are presumed to be too difficult or too expensive. Each season we offer an average of one play or musical premiere for Kansas City audiences. Second is trademark living room lobby, which we plan to emulate in our new home at the Warwick Theatre. Third is our intimate audience seating arrangement, with patrons within 3- 20 feet of the stage. We are excited to welcome our patrons and visitors to our new home; although it will look different, the experience will be the same familiar feeling they expect when coming to MET. Instead of a static stage and seating, the seating and stage change for each production. Audience members tell us they love these features, which is why it is so important to us to bring that with us to the Warwick Theatre! MET offers extraordinary arts and culture experiences to the next generation. Six (6) of the 7 plays will occur during the 2018-2019 school year, so we will continue to recruit local school districts to bring their students for student matinees. We know that around 50% of students at our student matinees have never been to a live theatre performance. Perhaps some of these students will pursue theatre careers or become theatre lovers through student matinees. During the 2016-17 season, we began a post-show talkback for the final Thursday performance of each play. We have found that added feature to be a stimulating draw for our audience and some patrons that attended on a different day come back to participate in the talk backs. MET audiences are extremely literate, curious and engaged. They revel in the opportunity to discuss plays, their relevance and to learn about each other. We use online and print ads in a variety of electronic and print publications, social media, mailings to our patrons and those of the theatre community in Kansas City, our Main Street billboard, ads in programs of other Kansas City performing arts organizations and radio and television promotions. Promotional information was previously addressed.","The presence of MET at the Warwick will help anchor Midtown as a burgeoning live theatre district in KC, inviting the community to share the joy inspired by exceptional performers who bring extraordinary stories to life! We currently plan to hold Season 14 in the Warwick Theatre (our future home near 39th and Main). We will be moving our staff and volunteer offices and season of productions to inaugurate the first season held at the Warwick Theatre. METs presence improves the safety of our neighborhood and increases visibility and traffic to the Midtown area all year long, making it a regular destination for returning patrons and drawing new visitors to our area. There are many new thriving businesses in our area. Several of these are natural partners for our theatre. We are looking forward to cross marketing with local restaurants, pubs, and hotels, as well as providing a pub atmosphere of our own. We plan to continue our presence with VisitKC, as well. Old Hyde Park Historic District and MSCID/MainCor have each provided letters of support. Neither group will have a role in organizing or hosting the event. However, Old Hyde Park will promote the event at their neighborhood general meeting. MSCID/MainCors mission does not include organizing or hosting other events. However, we have co-marketed with MainCor via a special discount code to their members for tickets. Old Hyde Park and MSCID/MainCor have been terrifically enthusiastic about our presence here on Main Street. This Fall, we are planning to have an event at the Warwick to bring together area businesses and to promote upcoming events.  Getting to know everyone on a more personal basis will help encourage our ongoing collaboration. MET will produce 7 plays during the 2018-2019 NTDF grant year that will each run for 12 public performances, not only offering cultural opportunities for residents, but drawing visitors from other parts of the metro area and surrounding communities to the Old Hyde Park Historic District, to the Main Street Community Improvement District, and to other dining, music, and art venues in the District. Through conversations with our patrons we have been able to glean some valuable information about their leisure activities. We learned that slightly more than half of our audience visited local establishments (restaurants and taverns) before attending an evening show and around 37-40% went out after an evening performance. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City. MET is a strong contributor to Kansas Citys lively arts, cultural, and entertainment matrix. We are excited that as we grow, we contribute to the growth of our neighbors as well.","MET measures success in three ways: audience attendance, artistic excellence and patron participation. As noted above, we can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season and track where the patron lives. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster or other factor. Trends and correlations are regularly reported to our board and used to determine what works and what may need to be changed. Our analysis led to an expansion of the senior discount ticket to every performance this season, and introduction of a Young Professional (under 39) discounted, anytime ticket. These changes resulted in increased attendance from both groups. Artistic excellence is evaluated constantly to always achieve our artistic best. From selection of great plays, premieres and classics, casting exemplary artists, anchoring each production with a crack shot artistic team and bringing the best of our art form to the MET stage, to presenting our plays in the most dynamic ways possible, MET achieves artistic excellence. This commitment to excellence has paid off with a strong reputation for outstanding work and notable critical reviews from print and online reviewers, as well as frequent praise in social media posts. Audience behavior is a huge indicator of artistic success. Their engagement, participation and increased attendance in ancillary events created around the play indicates strong interest and appreciation for our work. We have a good track record of repeat attendance from first time attendees and many of them convert to season ticket holders. We also now have two dozen long-term partners, members of our audience who have purchased a lifetime ticket. Our volunteer base is continuing to grow as well, now at 272. Audience talk back sessions following the last Thursday evening performance of a play is an increasingly popular method for our actors and audience members, plus theme experts when appropriate, to have a lively discussion around each plays topics. Social media traffic is an exceptional way for us to measure success. It encourages patron engagement through opportunities to ask thought-provoking questions, post educational information, show behind the scenes pictures and keep patrons upto-date with show schedules. We have seen a drastic increase of social media traffic through the analytic updates sent to us by social media providers. Related to social media outreach, our audience has shown a significant increase of patrons 18-35 years of age. Social media is a fantastic platform to interact with audiences and has been shown to pique the interest of the 35-55 age demographic, as well.","MET currently uses the Vendini ticketing system through which we collect and store data on each ticket purchaser. When a ticket is sold online, the patron self-identifies as an adult, young adult (under age 39), senior, or student. Their name, address, and phone number are also recorded in the system, and of course the particular play or musical attended. Box office staff collects the same information when tickets are purchased over the phone or at the door and the information is entered into the Vendini patron database. Using Vendini data, MET can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season, and track whether the patrons lived in Kansas City, Missouri or in specific cities near or far away. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster, or other factor. The data allow us to conduct targeted marketing for future plays as well, such as mailings to patrons that appear to prefer comedies, dramas, or musicals. We estimate that approximately 5,760 people will attend the entire 7-play MET season, including approximately 4,724 visitors from outside of Kansas City, Missouri. Based on analysis of 7,492 records in our Vendini database in June 2017, we know that 61% of past attendees came from outside of Kansas City, Missouri; and 3.7% came from states outside of Missouri and Kansas. We anticipate this trend to continue. Over the years, we have learned that each production at MET draws approximately 300 new patrons to the theatre on average. Many become return visitors or season ticket holders if they live close enough. Many others return a few times a season when in town on business travel, but come often enough that we have learned their faces. However, the vast majority of patrons come from Jackson County, Missouri and Johnson County, Kansas.  We are continuing to see ongoing increases born of the initiative we put into motion in 2015-2016 to develop new audiences.","POINT (-94.586159 39.055705)","39.0556414 -94.5857322"

When we schedule concerts at the Kauffman PAC we are able to take full advantage of their advertising programs which promote events to over 60,000 people throughout the region and beyond.","The KCCO is the only professional orchestra that exclusively plays chamber music in this region. The KCCO is also a critically acclaimed and important part of the cultural fabric of Kansas City. KCMO's reputation as a premier center for arts and cultural events is responsible for attracting regional and national tourists to the area. The KCCO is a unique and important part of the package of performing arts that makes Kansas City rich and vibrant. In an effort to make this music accessible to new audiences that have not traditionally attended concerts of classical music the KCCO provides welcoming greeters, intermission chocolates, and post-concert receptions in some of the most beautiful landmark venues and restaurants in Kansas City's famous neighborhoodsWe treat residents from Kansas City and the surrounding areas as our guests and market the venues, the areas they are in and the concerts equally.","When the KCCO schedules concerts in a venue our audience members know they will feel safe in that neighborhood and that the area supports the performing arts. In addition the KCCO works with local restaurants to provide special event offers to audience members who wish to dine before or after concerts. The KCCO often hosts a post concert event for audience members, musicians and patrons in a nearby restaurant. These activities introduce our audience members to new places to dine and seek other entertainment.  As our members become familiar with an area they will be more likely to come back themselves and to recommend the area to their friends.","We will evaluate the success of our Public concerts and the ""Classical Adventures"" -education program series based on the following criteria:I. Total number of public performed    A. Total number of audience members attending public concerts    B. Audience comments communicated in writing, email, social media or by phone    C. Critical reviews in local publications such as the Kansas City Star or KC Metropolis or on line i.e. the Examiner    D. Total number of standing ovationsII Total number of education programs performed   A.

Number of schools returning from previous years    D. Number of new schools or community groups    E. Compilation and evaluation of the teacher surveys and responses    F. Notes received from the students","Based on previous year's ticket sales demographic information the three concerts that will be held in the Crossroads and Downtown districts will bring in between 2,000 - 2,500 audience members, comprised of residents, visitors, and tourists, to the Kansas City neighborhood areas. Our ticket sales and season ticket holder data indicate that approximately 20% of the audience are from at least an hours drive from Kansas City and the ticket sales data also shows that over 40% of the attendance at all three Kansas City Missouri concerts will be from the surrounding cities and suburbs. When that figure is added to the 20% of the audience being out of town visitors that equals 60% of the audience members from outside of the KCMO boundaries.  That means that 1,200-1,500 audience members from outside of the Kansas City boundaries will be spending additional money on hotels, restaurants, bar, retail, entertainment, and other businesses in these areas as well as possible additional events or attractions. ""Visit KC"" estimates that for every dollar spent on advertising that $81 is returned in visitor revenue. A $10,000 investment by the NTDF in the KCCO's advertising has the potential to generate $81,000 in additional revenues to this city's businesses.",,

The 2018 MCC Storytelling Celebration is a four-day event, from November 8-11, designed to inspire, entertain and educate area children and their families via the vanishing art of the compelling tale as told by skilled storytellers.  The Celebration will feature 40 local and nationally acclaimed storytellers in 225 free performances and related events throughout the Kansas City area.  An estimated 15,000 people are expected to participate in this FREE, family friendly event led by storytellers  both professional and regional amateur tellers  who represent a wide range of cultures and performance styles. The Celebration will consist of several two- to three-hour performances by the four featured, internationally acclaimed storytellers, including a spooky and exciting night of ghost stories; scores of 45-minute to one-hour storytelling performances at schools, libraries and other community venues; plus several storytelling workshops.  Approximately 80% of the participants will be children K-12 from schools in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas as well as from the North Kansas City, Fort Osage and Kearney school districts.  Roughly a third of participants will be from low-income, disadvantaged families for whom the Storytelling Celebration may be their only exposure to the arts during the year.The Celebration brings together the rich tapestry of a diverse Kansas City through the art of storytelling. The spoken word can unite individuals and communities like no other art form - it lacks the abstraction that musical and visual arts sometimes possess, making it easy for audiences to take away a greater understanding of the artists message. Storytelling draws audiences together as neighbors.  Delivered with humor, music, and drama, listeners recognize and consider feelings about themselves and others. Appealing to all age groups and demographics, in 2017, the Celebration will continue to build communities and foster unity. Each performance is designed to appeal to the targeted audience.  A teller gifted in tailoring stories to seniors will present at selected elder care and assisted living facilities.  Spanish-speaking tellers present at Our Lady of Guadalupe School and tellers perform for those in the Juvenile Detention Center and Community Reintegration Group Home.  Tellers with expertise in engaging youth share stories at the Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the city.

Attracting and retaining qualified traditional and non-traditional students from culturally diverse populations is a key tenant in the colleges strategic plan. Instruction is provided to best serve all students at varying educational, financial, and overall literacy levels.","The Storytelling Celebration will be marketed in the Kansas City area as well as in small towns and rural and mid-size cities within a 100-mile radius.  Our target audiences are parents of young children as well as people interested in the arts and humanities.  Primary promotional efforts include paid ads and public service announcements via 11 radio stations, four television stations and 34 print publications serving multiple counties in northwestern Missouri.  We also make presentations to area Chambers of Commerce; Convention and Visitors Bureaus; as well as libraries, schools, and community organizations. A grassroots approach enlists Volunteer Steering Committee members and other volunteers for brochure distribution at past Celebration venues. Another important marketing tool is the MCC website, which includes links to information about the coming Storytelling Celebration as well as the most recently completed Celebration, which helps create long-lasting appeal for the event. Other marketing efforts include Facebook, Twitter, tumbler, Pinterest, Instagram as well as YouTube links to past events. These are similar to the efforts that have successfully attracted audiences during the past 17 years of the Storytelling Celebration. The Celebration brochure and other marketing materials will include a statement that all storytelling venues are fully accessible to people with disabilities and include information about where to call if additional special accommodations are needed. Additionally, the program for each Celebration event includes contact information (website) for the featured storyteller.","While participation varies among the 60+ venues, many neighborhood organizations are supporting the activities by promoting the events, providing the space, and assisting with logistics. Others are non-responsive to our notification, but none have expressed opposition.","For Kansas City non-residents, it provides a family friendly activity that is free, entertaining and occurring in diverse venues easily accessible from all parts of the city. With events well-publicized and offered throughout the Kansas City, Missouri and beyond, nonresidents are likely to hear about the event.

The Healing Drum Story targets youth who need the opportunity to experience an elders voice in their journey to finding inner calm.  Bully Billy Goat stories show children the harm of bullying and ways to avoid both bullying and being bullied.  Tales about Jack, the poor boy who, through hard work and cleverness, eventually secured money and respect.  Tales of Earth, Sea and Sky features designed to stimulate an interest in science, geology and astronomy.  Let Me Fly includes legends related to the Underground Railroad.

Residents receive information about the events through local TV stations, focused Scripps Network ads and print ads. Targeted mailings are sent to past attendees increasing the likelihood they will attend again. Our 2017 featured tellers are diverse, accomplished and will draw attendees with varied interests.  Adam Booth's storytelling blends traditional folklore, music, and an awareness of contemporary Appalachia.

Scott Whitehair is an international storyteller, teacher, and producer.  Sheila Arnold has given over 600 presentations for schools, churches, professional organizations and museums, in 26 states. The Celebration is designed to use the moving stories told by storytellers during the event as mini life lessons about various cultures, local history, and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of obstacles and adversity. To help audience members achieve a significant level of personal insight, the storytellers do much more than simply narrate an interesting or entertaining story. They engage the audience throughout their tales by initiating conversations with various audience members who may signal an emotional connection or other response to a story. Conversing with those most interested tends to draw other audience members into the discussion or at least the thought process behind the discussion. As a result, when tellers narrate stories about, for example, the multiple cultures and histories of area population segments, they actively involve participants in ways that enable them to achievean enhanced a sense of ownership and pride in their city, neighborhood and personal development. At the same time, the thought provoking nature of the stories encourages audiences to examine attitudes and prejudices on a symbolic level, employing ancient archetypes to focus on similarities between themselves and their neighbors, thus promoting acceptance and tolerance. Children K-12 will be the prime benefactors of the interactive storytelling sessions, most of which will occur in schools, libraries and other venues serving youth. But unlike other humanities events, the Celebration employs the unique storytelling format of story narration combined with audience discussion to promote key humanistic values, including acceptance, kindness, empathy and a sense of selfworth.","The activity will promote the neighborhood(s) by bringing visitors to the sites, creating a fun and entertaining opportunity for participants, and promoting the value of the participating partners. At each storytelling session, tellers encourage audience participation through open and spontaneous communication. As the audience becomes engaged with the teller, a dialogue is developed allowing the teller to tailor the story to that particular audience. Each performance is unique, creatively responding to audience feedback and each activity includes a participant survey. The arts foster a vitality and liveliness within a community. Examining the cultures and history of those that make up the Kansas City area can resonate through participants creating a sense of ownership and pride in their city, neighborhood and personal development. The Storytelling Celebration brings together many cultures fostering an understanding of those different from their own. To effectively sustain a vibrant community, community members must realize the different perceptions of the world and use this understanding as a guide to their actions and communication. Developing young people of the greater Kansas City metropolitan area is an investment in the vibrancy of localcommunities. Partnering with school districts, the Storytelling Celebration and year-round workshops provide opportunities for youth to explore the power of the articulate word and the ability to deliver a verbal message by engaging the listener. The project staff recognizes the importance of cultivating this art in the local youth to keep them engaged and this art form alive. In a 2012 article by Crawford Barniskis, a study found that ""through art...teens can: 1) create a supportive community; 2) connect and be more open and participatory; 3) engage more civically; and 4) become more involved in the communities in general.""","The project director will evaluate the effectiveness of the Storytelling Celebration by collecting data from audience members and educators who will be asked to provide feedback in the form of surveys and interactive comments. The evaluation is designed to assess the educational value of the event. The evaluation plan can chart trends, compare progress, and strategically assess changes in programming and results. Evaluation methods are specifically designed to be cost-effective. The evaluation plan includes the systematic collection of quantitative and qualitative data both necessary in capturing the full scope of the celebration. Quantitative data provides reliable analysis of each event toward assurances and objectives. The data is gathered from audience surveys and interactive comments. Qualitative data from the surveys provide validity in event and help determine the need for adjustments in service delivery, outreach, and community collaboration efforts. Formative evaluation shapes programming; data collection begins at the first event with regular monitoring to ensure areas in need of adjustment are addressed immediately. The Director is ultimately responsible for conducting the formative evaluation, ensuring that information is available in a timely manner and influencing the ongoing management of the events. Audience demographic and eligibility data are collected on the self-reported survey at the event. The responses are monitored by the director to determine quality of project and if adjustments need to be made.","All hosting venues are required to distribute and collect two evaluation surveys: one for general audience members and a second for educators. The general audience survey, which identifies each participants demographics and level of satisfaction with the session/event, enables planners to better determine what the audiences most enjoy  key factors in planning future events. The educator survey is designed to assess the educational value of various storytelling events, including how the Celebration stories and study guide support the teaching of Communications Arts and other Missouri core school standards. The purpose of evaluation is to gain feedback on how we can improve the festival and make the event the best experience possible for those attend the annual event. Past evaluation surveys from both audience members and educators have been extremely positive.",,"39.068401 -94.590408"

There will be sessions that will feature well known personalities, authors, and media spokespersons who will draw visitors to the events. Local media will be alerted to their visits so through media interviews information will be disseminated.","This symposium will appeal to persons living in the Kansas City Metro area in a couple different ways. The first way is through a historical and journalistic way. Edgar Snow was a Kansas City native who became the first western journalist to interview Mao Zedong in 1936. Years later, in 1965, Mao agreed to be photographed with Snow for a film Snow was making. This was the first time Mao was photographed for a foreign film. Persons living in Kansas City who are interested in journalism or history might find this fascinating. The next way is through an international trade way. With the current globalization of the world trade market more people are interested in learning how international trade relations matter in the business and political way. Since a main theme of this years symposium is U.S-China trade, this will be a huge draw to those in Kansas City.","The symposium will promote the neighborhood by bringing participants to the neighborhoods. By bringing participants to the neighborhoods, these participants will dine and shop in the area restaurants and shops located in the neighborhoods, thus having a positive economic impact on the community.

They were itinerant artists, many of whom had been brought into the cities to work on the huge cathedrals. When the work was completed, they needed to find another way to make a living, and thus often would recreate the paintings from the church onto the pavement. Aware of festivals and holy days held in each province and town, they traveled to join in the festivities to make a living from observers who would throw coins if they approved of the artist's work. For centuries, many Madonnari were folk artists, reproducing simple images with crude materials such as tiles, coal, and chalk. In 1973, street painting was being promoted in Italy by the formation of a two-day festival in Grazie di Curtatone in the Province of Mantua.**** All volunteer visual artists receive free pastel chalk and water and they are able to display their business cards to promote themselves. Local businesses and individuals can sponsor a canvas by contributing a donation to Kansas City Chalk and Walk. The business or individuals name will be prominently featured adjacent to sponsored street squares. All sponsors names will be published in the web site and promotional materials. Sections of the event site will be apportioned to children, who will receive an area as their street canvas. Each child will be provided a bucket of chalk at no charge. This area is called Childrens Creative Corridor. In addition, educational workshops will be held by museum educational programs, along with face painting and other activities. Attendees of the event will be able to casually stroll through the event and watch the artists as they create their classical and modern paintings.

In the past few years, our Grand Award Winners have placed in the top three of their respective categories, beating out over 1,700 other students from 78 countries. This past year alone, students won 4th place, 1st place & Best of Category along with 2 other Special Awards, which was the best showing at ISEF that our Fair has had to date. It is an exciting opportunity for those not living in Kansas City to witness a project in its infancy in Kansas City before it wins such high honors at an international level.  Maker Faire inspires, informs, connects and entertains thousands of attendees in a family-friendly environment that celebrates technology, education, science, arts, crafts, engineering, food sustainability and more. Maker Faire Kansas City is one of the largest Maker Faires in the world, and is the largest Faire in this region. They are drawn to Kansas City because our Faire is like no other  the diversity of the Maker booths, the attractions and the presenters sets us apart from all others. Every year, the MKFKC team works extremely hard to create an event that is representative of not only the Maker community in Kansas City, but of Kansas City as a whole. Historically, attendees from 40+ states attend Maker Faire Kansas City, highlighting the successful focus of making Maker Faire Kansas City a one-of-a-kind event that could not be experienced any other place than Union Station Kansas City.","The Greater Kansas City Science & Engineering Fair is a unique draw to Kansas City, Missouri residents. First launched in 1952, the GKCSEF is a staple in the local education landscape. Thousands of students and teachers from private, public, parochial, charter and homeschools participate every year  introducing new students and teachers every year to the wonder and joy of science exploration.  The Fair provides students a creative outlet for designing and developing a project. Attending the Fair as a participant or guest challenges both students and adults to think critically about important questions and issues that affect our world and our community. It showcases and highlights the work of our best and brightest students  the future of Kansas City.Maker Faire Kansas City is like no other festival held in Kansas City. It is part science fair, part country fair and part something entirely new! As a celebration of the Maker Movement, its a family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity and resourcefulness. Maker Faire gathers together tech enthusiasts, crafters, educators, tinkerers, food artisans, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs, artists, students and commercial exhibitors. Every year, hundreds of Makers come to show their creations and share their learnings at one of the largest Maker Faires in the world  only at historic Union Station Kansas City. Attendees flock to Maker Faire to glimpse the future and find the inspiration to become Makers themselves. Locals attend to learn more about the Maker Movement in Kansas City, and they are eager to show their support of their neighbors. Additionally, the pricing of the Faire is purposefully kept at a very competitive rate to encourage the attendance of families, and we do a great deal of outreach and marketing within Kansas City to attract local attendees. Maker Faire is THE single largest showcase of Kansas City Makers and Maker projects. Kansas City residents are very interested in supporting local Makers, and contributing to the success of the local Maker economy.","Union Station will promote the Crossroads Community Association and related activities/events through website links, onsite brochures and signage, calendars, and other approved media methods prior to, and during the Greater Kansas City Science & Engineering Fair and Maker Faire Kansas City. As in past years, the Crossroads Community Association will be invited to have a booth at MKFKC to promote their activities. Additionally, the event will draw thousands of people to the neighborhood  benefiting local restaurants, hotels and retail establishments.","We measure the success of the Greater Kansas City Science & Engineering Fair through comparative statistics on Fair Participation reaching back to 1997; Comparative statistics on Fair Project Numbers showing the breakdown of the number of students, projects, school districts, type of schools, number of schools per district, number of teachers per school, and number of new students from year to year. Information is also collected through student and teacher surveys that are completed each year. The success of Maker Faire Kansas City will be measured by attendance numbers, guest sentiment and level of partner involvement. Makers will have the opportunity to complete an electronic survey distributed after the event, and Faire-goers are encouraged to provide feedback onsite during the Faire with comment cards placed throughout Union Station. And, finally, the number of tickets sold for MKFKC will be tracked within our ticketing system. The data collected from all of these evaluation tools will assist in preparations for the next years Faire.","For the Greater Kansas City Science & Engineering Fair  all students, teachers, mentors and volunteers with the event must provide registration papers which include location demographics. Additionally, we will pull attendance demographics from the ticketed venues that Science & Engineering Fair attendees will also explore during their visit to Union Station.Maker Faire Kansas City is a ticketed experience and we will have access to purchase records within the ticketing system.

This tour is an opportunity to see how water, fish and wildlife add interest and excitement to the garden. 2018 will the be 25th anniversary tour; the WGS is making significant efforts to increase membership participation (greater number of water features on tour) and increase outreach, which is expected to increase the number of tour participants. Society members volunteer to have their ponds on the tour. This is not a tour of judged or selected ponds. Our membership resides throughout the metropolitan area; therefore the tour area is large. This year's tour will feature many ponds that have never been on the tour before. We do not expect visitors to visit every pond listed. A pond description is written by each of the owners to let visitors know what to expect when visiting. This helps visitors determine a tour route if the visitor is looking for something specific at the sites they want to visit. A series of codes will be provided to help the visitors decide which ponds they would like to visit. The owners will be present to share their experiences and answer questions. Professional pond designers/builders will also be at sponsored locations to answer questions about professional services. The tour is set up to bring neighbors and outside tourists into the Kansas City area.  Several of the community service projects that have been built by or maintained by the Water Garden Society will also be on display. Several sites are called Key sites. These sites contain free educational material on how to build ponds, and how to maintain water features once completed. The tour is designed to educate the public along with providing an entertaining weekend locally in Kansas City.","3","123456","Water gardens located throughout the KC metro area","4954 Marsh","64129","Water Garden Society members nominate their water features for the tour.

The specific ponds to be featured on the 2018 tour will be determined based on applications due in April 2018.  In the past, many neighborhoods in Kansas City have had at least one pond on the tour.  2018 will be the 25th anniversary tour.  The WGS is working diligently to enhance the tour in celebration of this milestone.  We anticipate many more water features on tour this year than in years past.

The purpose of the annual tour shall be to raise funds for community service projects and educational activities.","The Water Garden Society's Annual Public tour is promoted through many different venues in the gardening community. The Water Garden Society sets up entertaining/educational booths at several winter and spring Home and Garden Shows. At the home shows, WGS members distribute educational material free to the public. Tour brochures are handed out during the shows to let people mark their calendars for a great summer event. Additionally, the Society will be exhibiting at the 2018 Maker Faire, which is less than a month before the Public Tour and reaches a different demographic than might attend the home shows.  The tour is advertised in the Kansas City Gardener Magazine, many local newspapers and via other forums.  The tour is promoted regionally via an article in AAA Midwest, which is distributed in several Midwestern states.  Information is sent to local garden clubs who typically organize buses to take their members on the Water Gardens Public Tour.  In 2018, we anticipate that a garden club from the Tulsa OK area will organize a bus tour, in partnership with a downtown hotel.  In 2018, we anticipate using billboards at locations throughout the metro area to help encourage participation.  Social media is utilized to reach an audience that may not be receptive to print-based advertising.  The WGS will make a special effort to contact local business associations and chambers of commerce in the metro area to notify them of the tour and encourage their synergistic activities.  For the same reasons, neighborhood associations will be informed of the tour coming to their area to encourage other events at the same time in their neighborhoods. Local fliers are placed throughout the Kanas City Area with around 50 different businesses selling tickets to the event. Bright green signs and arrows are placed on the tour route during the tour dates to bring in people who may not of heard about the event ahead of time. Tickets are available at each of the sites.",,"With the educational aspect of Water Gardening, we reach out to several surrounding gardening clubs to bring people into our communities. Through advertising and social media a large range of people are reached that will have an interest in seeing the gardens of private home owners which are being offered for public display. With local advertising many people that are in town for other reasons may see flyers and be interested by the events description in going one or both days. The KC Public Tour is one of the premier events of this type in the nation.  In the past, visitors from many different states have participated on the tour.","Several community projects built by and maintained by the Kansas City Water Garden Society will be on display in Kansas City, Missouri. This lets the public know where these places are and the hidden beauties in their community that may have been overlooked in the past. It brings awareness to these community projects to hopefully get more community support for the organizations.","The Annual Public Tour brings a significant number of visitors into many parts of the metro area.  In many cases, tour attendees will have the opportunity to visit parts of the metro that they seldom, if ever, travel to.  While on the tour, attendees will become more familiar with beautiful neighborhoods and utilize services (gas, food) in those neighborhoods.Individual WGS members make efforts to contact neighborhood groups near their water features, to tell them about the upcoming Public Tour.  Neighborhood groups are invited to set up other complimentary events during the tour weekend.In 2018, the WGS will be making special efforts to link the Public Tour with other neighborhood arts organizations.  This is part of our increased outreach to celebrate our 25th anniversary.","The Public Tour is the main Fundraiser for the Water Garden Society. Success is measured by how much money is made. The proceeds benefit construction and restorative water gardens and other educational programs in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. A large portion of the funding raised by each years tour is used to purchase materials to install ponds at schools per request. Water Garden Society members build the ponds as a donation to the schools and commit to subsequently maintain the ponds, supplying new plants, fish and mechanical equipment when needed.","Each site has a registration book for each day. Each water feature site records visitor's home locations in generic terms, i.e., ""KS"", ""MO outside KCMO"", ""inside KCMO"".  If the visitors are from states other than Missouri or Kansas, their home state is recorded.  We are considering changing procedures for the 2018 tour to record visitor's homes by zip code instead of by general categories.  If implemented, this additional demographic detail would assist with targeted outreach efforts in future years.","POINT (-94.488305 39.03246)","39.032527 -94.4886073"

Its also a voluntary organization. This means not only are the dues voluntary, but the organization itself is completely ran by volunteers. Each year, these volunteers really look forward to getting together at the large shelter at Tower Park (75th & Holmes Road) for a good old-fashioned picnic.  It happens the 3rd or 4th Saturday in June and continues to be bigger and better than the year before.This annual picnic, which began in 2010, was created as a way to meet as many of the Waldo Tower neighbors as possible and to enjoy the park and all that it has to offer.  An added benefit is that many of the folks who are visiting the park that day will also stop by to enjoy free food and live music and get to know our community. Many of the volunteers wanted to make this event into something special for kids in the neighborhood so fun park activities are provided such as flying kites, sidewalk chalk, arts & crafts, free books from the Kansas City public library, a visit from the Zoo Mobile, face painting and bubbles.Occasionally the KCPD Mounted Patrol will make a visit and the KCFD has even come to spray down the kids when its hot.Theres also live music each year and just recently there was an added bonus, Movie Night!  In 2016, over 60 people came with their kids and watched the sun set on the historical Waldo water tower and then watched Trolls!  Future plans include creating a summer film series which would show classics for our older crowd as well as kid-friendly movies and wed even like to consider purchasing our own inflatable movie screen for this.The current cost to hold our annual picnic and movie night together is about $1,300, while the cost to purchase a movie screen would be $2,140 and we could also rent this out to other neighborhood organizations to have their own events. In 2016 we received a generous donation of hot dogs, hot dog buns, chips and condiments from the 6th District Councilman Kevin McManus who brought his daughter by to enjoy the events.All in all, our event is a great attraction not just for our members who enjoy getting to know each other, but also to the entire Waldo community and beyond.

To find a gay men's chorus of similar stature and quality in the Midwest, one must travel to Chicago, Minneapolis or Dallas. That literally makes Kansas City a hub in our service region for the singular programming we offer.  Our demographic research demonstrates that HMC programming regularly draws cultural tourists from beyond the KC metro area: audience members regularly travel from a 2 to 3 hour ring around Kansas City that includes Columbia, Springfield, Joplin, Wichita, Lawrence, Topeka, Lincoln, Omaha, Des Moines and a host of rural communities in between. HMC concerts are regularly visited by non residents who happen to be visiting downtown. Marquee signage at the Folly Theater promotes our programs making them visible to people who are staying at one of the many hotels in the downtown neighborhood or attending an event at Bartle Hall. Our June concert frequently coincides with a conference where educators from all around the country gather to grade advanced placement exams. We have a number of these folks who attend our concert each year.","HMC is recognized as a national force in the men's choral movement. HMC's programs are not standandsing choral performances: we employ staging, lighting, costumes, choreography, narrative, guest artists and instrumentalists and a host of other production elements to create a moving and stimulating entertainment experience. Because HMC is known as a regional attraction with a unique entertainment product, our performances regularly draw audience members from all parts of the metro area and beyond. Support by the NTDF has allowed our marketing to be robust and our audience development efforts to be highly successful.","Concert attendees patronize local businesses such as restaurants and hotels, and they experience new attractions while learning about all that downtown has to offer visitors and regional residents. In fact, during each pre concert reception held at Hotel Phillips, we ask our guests to raise hands if its their first time to visit the hotel. Invariably, 25% of our guests indicate its a new downtown experience for them. Downtown neighbors such as the Metropolitan Arts Council ArtsKC Fund; Hotel Phillips, DST and The Richard J. Stern Foundation for the Arts are sponsors of this project. The concerts will bring in a diverse group of people from other communities, both in the KC metro and beyond, to the neighborhood of downtown Kansas City, showcasing the spirit of our revitalized downtown. This project enhances Kansas City's stature as a regional leader in the arts and a regional destination for arts programming. Our customers gain a new appreciation of downtown KC that will play a role in bringing them back for repeat visits. We also raise greater awareness of the diverse arts and cultural offerings for which our city is gaining a regional and national reputation.  HMC concerts magnetize the neighborhoods by making them more attractive thus pulling in more people as active and engaged visitors and participants","Evaluation is essential for continued growth to advance our mission and achieve our vision: Our concert evaluation team (Artistic Director, Assistant Music Director, Accompanist, Concert Manager, Executive Director, Marketing Director) conducts a formal evaluation of each program. They identify what worked well so we can replicate our successes, and they identify areas for improvement so that we can continually move toward higher levels of excellence. Notes are taken to document the group's findings and reports are shared with our Board of Directors. Audience feedback is solicited via an exclusive email address advertised in each concert playbill. Detailed reports are presented to the evaluation team and all feedback is carefully reviewed. We monitor social media to help us understand audience reaction to our programs and identify trends. Online surveys are utilized for outreach programs and audience members are encouraged to complete the survey and give feedback.","While we do conduct periodic audience surveys, our ticketing system provides the most reliable demographic data.

This opportunity allows HPKC to perform its winter concert at the iconic Folly Theater downtown. A concert at the Folly elevates our organization&#39;s profile by adding another historic landmark where our children have performed. This concert allows us to showcase our program as a whole and in individual ensembles--giving a tremendous performance opportunity to all of our 200 students in grades K-10.","4","4","Folly Theater","300 W 12th St","64105","n/a","Cultural","Rehearsals, planning, and lead-up will occur at the Northeast Community Center in the Historic Northeast in District 4.

The exterior was originally aglow with gas street lamps and horse drawn carriages pulled up to its regal entrance. For seven decades, the Folly had several names and featured iconic entertainers, including the Marx brothers and Gypsy Rose Lee. After many years sitting empty, in 1981, the Folly was threatened to be torn down. Powerhouses in the arts community banded together, providing the support needed to keep its doors open and revitalize the Folly Theater. Visitors from outside Kansas City, Missouri will have a wonderful opportunity to see a concert of talented, deserving children at this incredible venue at no cost. There are only 13 Harmony Project affiliates across the country, conducting powerful, evidence-based work. Harmony Project has been honored twice by the White House and featured at the Kennedy Center. The Kansas City affiliate is the fifth in the country, and this concert is an opportunity to see how our research-based model is transforming lives through the power of music.","Kansas City has a long history of love and appreciation for the arts. We are also a metropolitan area known for significant philanthropy. Harmony Project KC has a diverse approach that connects us with a wide variety of people: supporters of the arts, supporters of education, and those invested in community development. At our May recital at the Gem Theater in the Historic 18th & Vine Jazz District, we hosted hundreds of people with our &#34;Fill the Gem&#34; campaign. Attendees included community members, partners, Board members and funders. Harmony Project KC has 965 followers on Facebook and our monthly newsletter has a reach of 735 people. Our support comes from all over the metropolitan area, locally in the Northeast, downtown, the Plaza, Brookside, Waldo, Loch Lloyd, the Northland, and Johnson County on the Kansas Side. At Harmony Project KC, music is used to unite these diverse children--and it also unites our broad base of support.","The Winter Concert at the Folly will provide an opportunity for Harmony Project KC stakeholders and visitors to explore downtown and see an historic performing arts venue in our city. The traditional format of a concert is usually accompanied by by a meal and/or shopping for concertgoers. This will encourage visitors to learn more about the neighborhood they are visiting. By visiting the Folly and learning about their upcoming concert series, attendees will be more likely to continue their patronage of the venue and the surrounding businesses.","Event measurements of success include: *Prompt completion of all steps in the timeline of execution detailed earlier in the application *Attendance of 300+ individuals *Successful planning of the reception by our Leadership students *Attraction of individuals living outside of Kansas City, MO. *Feedback solicited regarding performances on parent and student impact surveys. *Reactions from community members, guests and donors at the reception.

Horton Foote won a Pulitzer Prize and two Academy Awards but only finished his magnum opus shortly before his death.  In THE ORPHANS HOME CYCLE, Foote folds nine related plays into three parts crafting an intimate American epic thats at once personal and panoramic.  The play opens as twelve-year-old Horace Robedaux loses his father and takes him from displaced child to struggling young adult, to young soldier in WWI, through romance and fatherhood to seasoned adult. The Cycle unfolds during the early decades of the 20th century in rural South Texas, chronicling a generation reeling from the Civil War and struggling with Reconstruction. Over the years, more changes evolve, including an economic shift, a World War and a flu pandemic - all chillingly relevant today.  Honest and forthright, tender and bracing, the story marries growing up, love, romance, systemic racism, struggle, hope and ultimate victory.  This is a Heros Journey in an exquisite tale.

MET exists to share access to the great works of theatre with all people in our community, to inspire creativity, to encourage a culture of inclusion, to empower individuals, and build community through the transformational power of the arts. We are committed to four core values: access, artistry, innovation and excellence.","This production is a regional premiere of an amazing epic that has only been produced in full a handful of times. MET has experience with producing reps like this, such as the KENTUCKY CYCLE. In prep, we&#39;ve begun booking special interest groups around the Midwest to bring members to this show. To enhance the festival experience, we will be partnering with local restaurants to provide quick bites between our Saturday performances. We have community outreach programs planned to draw in more patrons to our enthusiastic audiences. We will be expanding our advertising efforts with this show to re-brand our space and draw in even more patrons. We post our season on event calendars that reach wide regional audiences, and each new season is posted on VisitKC.com. We are thrilled that NTDF posts MET plays on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks. MET is regularly featured in several different reviews by local and regional media outlets. We are regularly critiqued and covered in digital media including Broadway World Kansas City. Immediately before and during the plays run, we place ads in key media outlets within the range of our budget (e.g. Ink, Kansas City Star). This year, we have ads in room guides in four area hotels. The concierge at these hotels are given special tickets for tourists looking for a front row seat to some of Kansas Citys best theatre. MET&#39;s lively social media platform is very effective in promoting our productions, now up to 4500 likes on our Facebook page. We use targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. In addition, we market the season and each play via Twitter, Instagram and on our own website. Local television and radio outreach promote each play, including television and radio interviews and ticket giveaways for radio stations. Staff, board members, cast members, and key volunteers distribute play-specific flyers to Midtown coffee shops and businesses and more broadly throughout the metropolitan area. Each play is advertised in our full-season flyer mailed in the fall and spring. THE ORPHANS HOME CYCLE will be advertised in all our Season 14 material, going out this fall. The list, generated from actual ticket sales over the years and expanded through a partnership with the Kansas City Rep, covers more than 52 counties of Missouri and Kansas as well as addresses from other states. Another 10,000+ mailing to theatre patrons is planned, which will feature the additional 8 plays of the 9-production season. MET places ads in programs passed out at other major arts performances for the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, the Kansas City Ballet, and New Theatre Restaurant. We market to unique audiences as well, identifying correlative interest groups who might enjoy specific performances. Growing our audiences and supporting this regional marketing effort is a major priority. As a sponsor of the season, NTDF will be mentioned as a presenting sponsor on all print and digital media.",,"MET seeks to attract adults, seniors, young professionals and students living in our region (within about a 3-hour drive of Kansas City) to our plays, and tourists and business travelers who may be here for a different reason but are attracted to our theatre. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City; they return again and again. Theatre lovers visiting the City for business or pleasure will find us because they like high quality, professionally produced plays. Intriguing themes or the opportunity to see a famous play will also attract the more casual theatre goer. Tickets (adult) average $30 each affordable for most any pocketbook - are a good value for visitor dollars. Our dynamic pricing continues with special Festival Passes for just $33 per show with a free refreshment included! Casually dressed visitors and patrons and those in evening wear mingle comfortably at our come-as-you-are venue. We believe METs online presence will be the primary avenue used to attract regional patrons or tourists/business travelers to one or more plays during the season. Each play will be listed in area print calendars and in online event calendars, such as the VisitKC.com website. We will place online ads in KC STUDIO magazine, Ink, and other digital outlets. We are also using targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. METs extremely lively social media platform produces great results, now up to 4,500 likes on our Facebook page, and we market via Twitter, Instagram and our own website. Online reviews of our plays during the run will be available at the Kansas City Star, The Pitch, and Broadway World Kansas City. Travelers may also see a print ad or review in the Kansas City Star, Ink or The Pitch; or pick up a flyer distributed by staff and volunteers to local coffee shops or hotels. We are in the process of contacting tourism and business and leisure travel promotional organizations within a three-hour radius of Kansas City, to explore promotional opportunities in cities such as Des Moines, Omaha, Wichita, Lincoln, Joplin, Columbia and Topeka. Kansas City television and radio stations also cover a broad regional market, so our interviews and ticket giveaways will reach nearby smaller cities and towns. Our ads will be in programs passed out at other major arts performances (e.g. the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, etc.). Our marquee on the front of the Warwick receives 78,000 impressions each week from residents and visitors alike. NTDF ads on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks will promote the event to travelers as well.","Each MET season offers something for everyone of any age and from all walks of life. Our target audiences include adults, young professionals, seniors and students. METs 2018-2019 season covers a broad spectrum of palettes, for audiences that enjoy thought provoking plays to those that enjoy lighter material. We also represent our city on the stage by choosing pieces that reflect the cultural diversity of our community. Kansas City, Missouri residents and those from other metro area communities will attend because they wish to see a famous play or musical that they have never seen before, because they simply love professional theatre, or because something about a theme or subject intrigues them and they want to see what the play is all about. MET is also unique among local theatre companies given a combination of three features. First, we produce major masterworks and contemporary classics - plays or musicals that are award-winning and famous, but rarely produced in Kansas City because they are presumed to be too difficult or too expensive. Each season we offer an average of one play or musical premiere for Kansas City audiences. Second is trademark living room lobby, beautifully realized in our new home, the Warwick Theatre. Third is our intimate audience seating arrangement, with patrons within 3- 30 feet of the stage. We are excited to welcome our patrons and visitors to our new home; although it will look different, the experience will be the same familiar feeling they expect when coming to MET. Instead of a static stage and seating, the seating and stage change for each production. Audience members tell us they love these features, which is why it is so important to us to maintain them in the Warwick Theatre! MET offers extraordinary arts and culture experiences to the next generation. THE ORPHANS HOME CYCLE has been booked by local school districts to bring their students for student matinees. We know that around 50% of students at our student matinees have never been to a live theatre performance. Perhaps some of these students will pursue theatre careers or become theatre lovers through student matinees. During the 2016-17 season, we began a post-show talkback for the final Thursday performance of each play. We have found that added feature to be a stimulating draw for our audience and some patrons that attended on a different day come back to participate in the talk backs. MET audiences are extremely literate, curious and engaged. They revel in the opportunity to discuss plays, their relevance and to learn about each other. This season we are expanding our marketing plan to use online and print ads in a variety of electronic and print publications, social media, mailings to our patrons and those of the theatre community in Kansas City, ads in programs of other Kansas City performing arts organizations and radio and television promotions. Promotional information was previously addressed.","The presence of MET at the Warwick anchors Midtown as a burgeoning live theatre district in KC, inviting the community to share the joy inspired by exceptional performers who bring extraordinary stories to life! We are thrilled to open Season 14 in the Warwick Theatre, our new home near 39th and Main. We have moved our staff, volunteer offices, and season of productions to inaugurate the first season held at the Warwick Theatre. In addition to bringing an exciting new venue online for theatre, art, and civic events, METs presence improves the safety of our neighborhood and increases visibility and traffic to the Midtown area all year long, making it a regular destination for returning patrons and drawing new visitors to our area. There are many new thriving businesses in our area; several of these are natural partners for our theatre. We are cross marketing with local restaurants, pubs, and hotels, as well as providing a pub atmosphere of our own. We are continuing our presence with VisitKC, as well. Old Hyde Park Historic District and MSCID/MainCor have each provided letters of support. While neither group will have a role in organizing or hosting the event, Old Hyde Park will promote the event at their neighborhood general meeting. SCID/MainCors mission does not include organizing or hosting other events. However, we have co-marketed with MainCor via a special discount code to their members for tickets. Old Hyde Park and MSCID/MainCor have been terrifically enthusiastic about our presence here on Main Street. In August, we are planning to have an event at the Warwick to bring together area businesses and to promote upcoming events. Getting to know everyone on a more personal basis will help encourage our ongoing collaboration. METs production of THE ORPHANS HOME CYCLE will run for 12 public performances, not only offering cultural opportunities for residents, but drawing visitors from other parts of the metro area and surrounding communities to the Old Hyde Park Historic District, to the Main Street Community Improvement District, and to other dining, music, and art venues in the District. Through conversations with our patrons we have been able to glean some valuable information about their leisure activities. We learned that slightly more than half of our audience visited local establishments (restaurants and taverns) before attending an evening show and around 37-40% went out after an evening performance. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City. MET is a strong contributor to Kansas Citys lively arts, cultural, and entertainment matrix. We are excited that as we grow, we contribute to the growth of our neighbors as well.","MET measures success in three ways: audience attendance, artistic excellence and patron participation. As noted above, we can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season and track where the patron lives. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster or other factor. Trends and correlations are regularly reported to our board and used to determine what works and what may need to be changed. Our analysis led to an expansion of the senior discount ticket to every performance this season, and introduction of a Young Professional (under 39) discounted, anytime ticket. These changes resulted in increased attendance from both groups. Artistic excellence is evaluated constantly to always achieve our artistic best. From selection of great plays, premieres and classics, casting exemplary artists, anchoring each production with a crack shot artistic team and bringing the best of our art form to the MET stage, to presenting our plays in the most dynamic ways possible, MET achieves artistic excellence. This commitment to excellence has paid off with a strong reputation for outstanding work and notable critical reviews from print and online reviewers, as well as frequent praise in social media posts. Audience behavior is a huge indicator of artistic success. Their engagement, participation and increased attendance in ancillary events created around the play indicates strong interest and appreciation for our work. We have a good track record of repeat attendance from first time attendees and many of them convert to season ticket holders. We also now have two dozen long-term partners, members of our audience who have purchased a lifetime ticket. Our volunteer base is continuing to grow and change with the renovation of the Warwick. We are seeing more participation from families and men. Audience talk back sessions following the last Thursday evening performance of a play is an increasingly popular method for our actors and audience members, plus theme experts when appropriate, to have a lively discussion around each plays topic. Social media traffic is an exceptional way for us to measure success. It encourages patron engagement through opportunities to ask thought-provoking questions, post educational information, show behind the scenes pictures and keep patrons up-to-date with show schedules. We have seen a drastic increase of social media traffic through the analytic updates sent to us by social media providers. Related to social media outreach, our audience has shown a significant increase of patrons 18-35 years of age. Social media is a fantastic platform to interact with audiences and has been shown to pique the interest of the 35-55 age demographic, as well.","MET currently uses the Vendini ticketing system through which we collect and store data on each ticket purchaser. When a ticket is sold online, the patron self-identifies as an adult, young adult (under age 39), senior, or student. Their name, address, and phone number are also recorded in the system, and of course the particular play or musical attended. Box office staff collects the same information when tickets are purchased over the phone or at the door and the information is entered into the Vendini patron database. Using Vendini data, MET can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season, and track whether the patrons lived in Kansas City, Missouri or in specific cities near or far away. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster, or other factor. The data allow us to conduct targeted marketing for future plays as well, such as mailings to patrons that appear to prefer comedies, dramas, or musicals. We estimate that approximately 2700 people will attend the entire run of THE ORPHANS HOME CYCLE, including approximately 1701 visitors from outside of Kansas City, Missouri. Based on analysis of 7,492 records in our Vendini database in June 2018, we know that 63% of past attendees came from outside of Kansas City, Missouri; and 2.2% came from states outside of Missouri and Kansas. We anticipate this trend to continue. Over the years, we have learned that each production at MET draws approximately 300 new patrons to the theatre on average. Many become return visitors or season ticket holders if they live close enough. Many others return a few times a season when in town on business travel but come often enough that we have learned their faces. However, most patrons come from Jackson County, Missouri and Johnson County, Kansas. We are continuing to see ongoing increases born of the initiative we put into motion in 2015-2016 to develop new audiences. We are particularly interested in growing our service to traditionally underserved communities and are pleased to see increases in those areas this season.","POINT (-94.586159 39.055705)","39.0556414 -94.5857322"

Since 2000, Agriculture Future of America (AFA) has presented the Leader in Agriculture Award to two individuals who have made significant contributions within the food and agriculture industry and have a record of supporting career and leader development for young men and women in agriculture. Each award honors an individual whose accomplishments, personally and professionally, distinguish him or her as a mentor to young leaders in the agriculture industry. One of the greatest opportunities for leaders is to bring together diverse groups of thought and people to search for solutions that are truly better together. At AFA, we feel this dinner provides an outlet for these individuals and organizations to learn more and celebrate the industry. In 2017 over 1,200 individuals attended this event. This year the 2018 AFA Leader in Agriculture Award will be presented to Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy and the 2018 AFA Young Leader in Agriculture Award will be presented to Amanda De Jong. Ramaswamy is currently the president of the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, which accredits institutions in northwestern states, as well as recognizing schools in Canada. De Jong is the state executive director of the Iowa Farm Service Agency. Kansas City has been a hub of many aspects of the agriculture industry including the American Royal, Kansas City Stockyards, Animal Health Corridor, Future Farmers of America (FFA) and Agriculture Future of America. In 1996, Kansas City philanthropist R. Crosby Kemper, Jr. founded Agriculture Future of America. For 22 years, AFA has offered leader and career development training and academic scholarships for men and women pursuing careers in an agriculture-related field. R. Crosby Kemper, Jr., passionately believed that the best young leaders come from rural backgrounds and he wanted to give them tools to succeed. Moreover, he believed that Kansas City, with its strong agriculture base, should be the location of a premier leader development organization to identify, encourage and support outstanding collegiate leaders who were pursuing careers in agriculture. Since then, AFA has honored Mr. Kemper&#39;s commitment to agriculture&#39;s young leaders, awarding leader and academic scholarships and providing premiere leader development programs for college students and young professionals. Hundreds of people will travel to Kansas City, MO to celebrate and develop leadership for four days, highlighted by the Leader in Agriculture Award Dinner.","4","4","Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center","2345 McGee St.","64108","The Westin Kansas City at Crown Center, 1 E Pershing Rd, Kansas City, MO 64108","Educational","Crown Center","1300","1200","Annual","10000","4286","4286","180736","AFA builds bridges for young leaders to foster engagement and innovation in food and agriculture.","With the goal of advancing the industry of agriculture and food, AFA will promote involvement by highlighting the universally beneficial aspects of attending the Leader in Agriculture Award dinner on our website, during face to face visits, through social media, brochures, press releases, digital advertisements and mail invitations. AFA will also work with the Visit KC and the City Manager&#39;s Office to promote the Leader in Agriculture Award dinner to local residents and incoming tourists. AFA is committed to our marketing efforts and have hired an outside brand consultant to help focus our strategy in 2018.

Finally, another 60+ universities will have the event promoted by way of their student&#39;s selection to attend.",,"Like a similar program AFA holds in Kansas City, the AFA Animal Institute, students from across the country are exposed to agribusiness and especially animal health businesses in the Kansas City community. Nearly 80% of students attending AFA events are unaware of such a strong agribusiness presence in Kansas City and many had never been to the community before. Between our working with Visit KC, KCADC and many of our local industry partners, Kansas City is promoted to students as a great place to live and work. Outside of students, many of the local eateries, museums and other attractions are a highlight of their attendance. We do our best to highlight and encourage tourism and shopping for every guest who either attend or bring their families. Whether it be BBQ, the Plaza or National World War One Museum, oftentimes we hear of visitors bringing family and spending the weekend here as a result of our event.","This event will appeal to residents of Kansas City because it will explore and celebrate a historical part of the city that is often overlooked but is a large part of our society. Guests attending the AFA Leader in Agriculture Award dinner share the belief that the production, processing and distribution of food and fiber, with support for agriculture business services, are vital for our local and our nations economy, both now and in the future. These guests will also see the benefit from AFA&#39;s unique ability to help them forge rich, relevant connections with high-integrity industry leaders, stimulating their professional and intellectual development and creating a mentorship model that enables lifelong learning.","The AFA Leader in Agriculture Award Dinner will bring together over 1,000 individuals from around the nation to Kansas City. Before and during their stay AFA will promote local businesses, attractions, and events in Kansas City on our website and in brochures. In this information, guests will also find information promoting attractions, restaurants, and activities in and around Crown Center.","AFA strategically collects and evaluates feedback following all AFA programs. Not only does AFA evaluate specific content and speakers by way of these evaluations, but data are also collected to evaluate overall satisfaction of the program as well as some strategic pillars of the program to ensure the relevancy of programming. AFA specifically strives to rate better than 8 on a 10 point Likert scale on overall satisfaction; relevance; timeliness; complexity; expansion beyond academic learning; and program quality. AFA has created a consistent form of measurement for all programs across all years to show year-over-year changes.

Our mission is making dance accessible to all people by presenting the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (AAADT) and Ailey II, teaching young people critical life skills through dance, and modeling interracial and multi-cultural community partnerships. We are driven by a vision of a diverse community united by dance to inspire and change lives. We have educated more than 1.1 million Kansas Citians since our founding in 1984 as the only second home to the internationally-acclaimed Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Ailey II. Today, we continue to serve the Kansas City community as an educator, facilitator, and presenter.EDUCATORWe teach 28,000 underserved youth annually through 11 year-round educational programs including two summer AileyCamps in partnership with the Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas school districts, in-school interactive demonstrations and workshops, theater performances, and free jazz, modern, ballet and tap classes at our David T. Beals, III Studio. Our youth development programs change lives for at-risk children by teaching them pursuit of academic excellence, smart lifestyle choices, fitness, self-discipline, and positive self-esteem. Demographics for our programs are predominantly African-American or Black, followed by Caucasian, Hispanic, multi-ethnic, and Asian.FACILITATORWe host an annual Symposium event that brings together local and national experts to discuss issues of race, place, and diversity and their influences on the current culture and future of Kansas City. The event also showcases multi-cultural partnerships using KCFAA as a national model. The goal of Symposium is to cultivate a more inclusive Kansas City community by helping participants explore and understand different perspectives. We impacted 250 participants in 2015. Our 2016 Symposium is scheduled for Thursday, November 10th at the Gem Theater in the 18th and Vine Jazz District. PRESENTERKCFAA is New York-based Alvin Ailey American Dance Theaters only second home. We support the work, vision, and sustainability of Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation through annual residencies, new work commissions and general efforts to advance the legacy of Alvin Ailey. Our 2015 residency performances attracted a diverse audience of 5,200.","Kansas City Friends of Alvin Ailey (KCFAA) will collaborate with VisitKC, the Office of Cultural and Creative Services, and other organizations to promote the Symposium. We will create a presence on social media, in digital and print publications, and/or on the event calendars of each of these partners. The combined reach across various platforms will allow us to tap into a diverse cross-section of the community both inside and outside of Kansas City.In particular, we have worked with the Office of Cultural and Creative services to garner promotional placement on the digital kiosks at every streetcar stop and around the city. We will use this outlet again to promote the Symposium. We will also use our relationships with traditional media outlets such as KRPS Hotz 103.3 Jamz, the Independent, KC Studio Magazine, the Call, KC Star, Outfront Media, and local broadcast stations to secure promotional placement on radio, billboards, and local news coverage.

The Symposium offers a unique opportunity for the public from a broad area to come together for a meaningful interactive experience.If anyone should wonder why an arts organization would be presenting a Symposium on race, place, and diversity, the short answer is as follows: KCFAA has been committed to the values of diversity for 20 years, and is qualified through its work with at-risk youth to address racial issues. Also, the arts play a critical role in empowering communication on culture, commonality, and difference; they offer opportunities to develop new points of intersection.","The Symposium appeals to residents because it is unique. While university classes may cover some of the topics that we include, the Symposium is open to the public. The fee for the breakout sessions, including lunch, is $60.00. The Town Hall meeting is free. They Symposium gives residents the chance to examine their own attitudes about race, place, and diversity, and to share their opinions in a safe environment.","Some of the Symposium attendees may be experiencing the Historic 18th & Vine Jazz District for the first time, and in doing so are crossing geographic and socio-economic borders that might otherwise deter them from discovering a new and exciting part of town. The Symposium helps to show that the neighborhood brings important elements of diversity to our cultural and arts community.Neighborhood groups are invited to set up a table in the lobby of the Gem Theater before and after the Town Hall Meeting.","The post-event participant survey asks the individual to evaluate the following statements.1. The information and discussion in this session were relevant to me.2. The information and discussion in this session challenged my thoughts about race, place, and/or diversity.3. The presenter made it safe for me to share my opinions.4. After the Town Hall meeting, I departed feeling better about the state of race relations.The latest survey results (see attached) indicate that the breakout sessions were successful in terms of being relevant, challenging, and safe for individual participation. It is interesting to note, however, that the prominent response to question 4 above was Disagree, by a wide margin. This is not necessarily a negative outcome. It is not the goal of the Town Hall meeting to make people feel better about the state of race relations. If people did in fact, feel worse, it is probably because they left the Town Hall questioning some of their core beliefs, or recognizing the need for change; and change is often uncomfortable. It is significant that these same participants responded Agree and Strongly Agree when they were asked if they were interested in attending future Town Hall meetings.","We administer a post-event participant survey to all individuals who attend. The survey is sent by email to each individual, and we use Survey Monkey to capture and analyze results. The survey consists of questions about the event itself and how the individual learned of it. The survey also invites the participate to share some demographic information.","POINT (-94.562626 39.091177)","39.090915 -94.562616"

The date is printed in other City in Motion event programs and listed on the website as a Save the Date. Promotional materials are designed and printed in March. Participating choreographers, dancers and artists are encouraged to distribute these promotional materials often while attending or working dance conventions and competitions, post flyers at area restaurants and businesses, and sell ads for the event program.

The Professional Company Concert is a collection of whats happening in modern/contemporary dance, and more specifically in Kansas City. With at least two Artistic Directors, opportunities offered to the dancers to choreograph works and at least one guest choreographer invited to set work on the company each season, this final event of the season is always fresh and relevant. There is variety and complexity in the modern dance choreography that is presented for the Company Concert. Each year, new pieces are created and old pieces are sometimes reworked, but never is a show exactly the same from one year to the next. City in Motion's professional dance company is comprised of local artists, many of whom often have family and friends from outside of Kansas City, dedicated to attending each and every concert in support. In addition, guest artists and guest choreographers are often invited to work with the company. In the past, Artistic Co-Director, Donna Frogge, returned briefly from Florida to re-work a piece she had previously set on the company about 6 years earlier, and David Ollington, from Kansas State University, spent a weekend at our studios setting a piece called Formula that was performed by the company in the 2011 and 2015 Company Concerts. The variety of artistic input and revolving choreography increases the appeal of the Company Concert and returned patronage each and every year.","City in Motion is made up of diverse, relatable people in the community which makes its events like the Professional Company Concert very appealing. Strong relationships have been established through its own School of Dance and all of the students who attend classes there, as well as with UMKC, the Metropolitan Community Colleges and area neighborhood associations including the Volker, Valentine, Coleman Highlands, West Plaza and Roanoke Neighborhoods, which all assist in promotion of the entire season due to our co-production of ""Dance in the Park"" in September. Also, the Professional Company does community outreach through Kansas City Young Audiences by traveling throughout the year to perform a unique show for the second and third graders at the Kansas City Public Schools. The children get to meet the dancers and learn how to combine science and dance. They look forward to someday attending one of City in Motion productions in our Performance Series, and are often excited that they got to meet some of the professional dancers. Promotional materials are left at each school for interested teachers and parents. The Professional Company Concert provides a glimpse into Kansas City's local modern/contemporary dance. With at least two Artistic Directors, opportunities offered to the dancers to choreograph works and at least one guest choreographer invited to set work on the company each season, this final event of the season is always fresh and relevant. The Professional Company Concert is a collection of whats happening in modern/contemporary dance, and more specifically in Kansas City. City in Motion is a home-grown, grass-roots organization which has had a strong presence for over 30 years with its true representation of Kansas City modern dance which appeals to the support local movement.","Each attendee to the event will receive a program to accompany the performance. While the program's primary purpose is to inform the audience member of certain details about the concert and the artists, it also features ads and information about the area in which the venue is located. Throughout the season, ads for these programs are sold to assist with production costs. These ads will often include a coupon or a free treat if the patron visits that establishment and mentions the ad. While many businesses across the Kansas City Metropolitan area place these ads in our programs, we often focus in on the venue location and therefore, the neighborhood receives recognition and promotion.","The success of our event is measured mostly by ticket sales and overall crowd feedback. If our budget revenues and expenditures balance out, we have either met or exceeded our goals. The projected budgets utilize numbers from the previous season and therefore we always hope to meet that same expectation or improve upon those numbers. Audience feedback either through word of mouth or surveys is a great measure of artistic success of the event and overall event execution. Another tool used to measure event effectiveness is media attention, whether that is extra advertising outside of the typical purchased ads or after performance reviews.","For City in Motion Dance Theaters Professional Company Concert, based on past event credit card sales and surveys about 15 to 20% of the total attendees are out-of-town tourists. City in Motions professional dance company is comprised of local artists, many of whom often have family, friends and students from outside of Kansas City, dedicated to attending each and every concert in support. The City Stage at Union Station seats 200, therefore if this event sells out all three performances, approximately 120 of those patrons do not live in Kansas City, MO. Promotional materials for each concert are designed and printed as save-the-date cards, posters and postcards. These are distributed throughout the region and posted at various businesses to provide awareness for our events. The postcards are also distributed by mail to our 4,000+ patrons on our mailing list.

Utilizing the classical sounds of Tchaikovsky and the pageantry of the Nutcracker, MOC takes us on a journey to a little town in the Middle East where history stopped... and then started over.The Mystery of Christmas was conceived in the mid 1980s in Nashville, TN.  Creator/Artistic Director/Choreographer Liz Dimmel had an idea to perform the classic Nutcracker with a Christmas story line.  As my husband pursued his music career in Nashville, I was thinking about a ballet that would be relevant during the holidays; one that would communicate to my children the real reason we celebrated Christmas.The first half of the production begins at an 18th century Christmas party. When Fritz and Clara begin fighting over the toys, their Grandfather, gently reminds them that toys and games and parties are not what Christmas is about. He proceeds to tell the Christmas story.  As Clara falls asleep she does not dream of Sugar Plum Fairies, but rather is transported back in time to witness the birth of Jesus.  Act one ends with the angelic host dancing before a humble stable that houses the birth of a king.  Act two showcases the ethnic dances of many nations honoring the birth of the savior.  This will be the 12th year MOC has added the nation of Africa and the 3rd year to have Ireland. The timeless music and richness of the story have made this event a yearly family tradition for many.

In addition to this series of productions, Mesner Puppet Theater does local and national touring shows, reaching more than 30,000 children each year.  Reaching children that face extra challenges is central to Mesner Puppet Theaters mission. For many agencies like Operation Breakthrough, Mesner Puppet Theater provides hundreds of free tickets every season.  Each Mesner Puppet Theater production draws children into a fantastic world where real life lessons are woven into brilliantly animated tales.  Children watch, many for the very first time, as a story unfolds right before their eyes.  A Mesner Puppet show is the perfect way to introduce young children to live theater performance.  This may be their first step to becoming a lifelong patron of the arts.  Through its productions, Mesner Puppet Theater champions a message of love, tolerance, inclusion and hope.

Parents of young children are always looking for something fun that they can do with their child - and it is even better if they can enjoy the event also.  This is exactly where Mesner Puppet Theater fits in.  The theater knows how to entertain and mesmerize children, while slipping in content that amuses the adults in the audience.

They make sure to talk with the children because they are completely honest about their reactions.  Also, the puppeteers watch audience reaction throughout every performance.  They can tell if something is working or not - and can make changes immediately to the performance so that it is better received the next day.  A performance can be shortened or modified on the spot - as this is part of the art of the puppeteer, reacting and engaging with the audience.School groups make up a major portion of the audience.

Each house has stories to tell about local and national history that remain resonant today. John Wornall and Alexander Majors were prominent citizens of Kansas City with southern heritage who were slave owners. As history educators, we believe it is the responsibility of historic sites like ours to tell the stories of the marginalized people who lived and worked in these homes, and to address the complexity of life on the Missouri-Kansas border during the tumultuous Civil War and Border War periods. The Wornall/Majors House Museums is dedicated to fully educating visitors about the events that took place in these historic homes. We strive to be a destination for those seeking inclusive and engaging Civil War education, both locally and nationally. In 2018, the Museums hope to engage in a large-scale marketing campaign to bring awareness to the Museums as places to engage in dialogue about historical issues that are still relevant today. Historic sites and museums have an important role in helping the public think critically about the past and how it effects the present. Our year-long calendar of events will focus heavily on educational programs that will allow people to explore their nation's past, including roundtable discussions, a Civil War Field Day, specialized exhibits and tours, and other hands-on workshops and events. Several larger fundraising events will support these educational programs, which will be either free or low-cost to provide as much accessibility as possible. The Wornall/Majors House Museums, being a small non-profit with limited resources, does not currently have a comprehensive marketing budget.

In addition, we have in the past contracted with our publicist Jayne Siemens, who has promoted our larger events through a variety of media sources such as magazines, newspapers, and TV spots. We hope to engage her on a more regular basis in 2018 to promote our calendar of events.",,"The historic topics covered by the Wornall/Majors House Museums are wide-ranging and not of merely niche local interest. Our events and tours cover important topics such as slavery, women's roles throughout history, advancements in transportation and communication, the westward trails, and the Civil War. These topics are of interest to anyone who has more than a passing interest in American history. The Wornall/Majors House Museums also enjoy both regional and national support. Only 43% of Wornall/Majors members reside inside Kansas City city limits. Of the remaining members, 46% live in Kansas, 3% live in Missouri (excluding Kansas City), and 6% live in other states, including California, New York, and the District of Columbia. Clearly, support and passion for the Museums is not confined to a specific geographic area.","Residents of Kansas City have a passion for their city and love learning more about it. They may be fascinated to know about how the struggle for emancipation and freedom for enslaved people had its origins on the Missouri-Kansas border. Or how Alexander Majors was an early commercial founder of Kansas City, opening the city as a hub of transportation into the western United States. Or even something as simple as who Wornall Road was named after. Residents will enjoy not only learning about these ""founding fathers"" of Kansas City, but also the largely untold stories of the women, children, enslaved people, and employees who were crucial parts of life in early Kansas City. Attendees of museum events will also recognize and trust many of our community partners for these events. Partnerships in 2017 included KCPT, UMKC, Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area, Restless Spirits Distillery, Kansas City Public Library - Waldo Branch, and the Heart of America Shakespeare Festival.","Wornall/Majors events bring a greater awareness to the historic character of the Wornall Homestead and Ward Parkway Plaza neighborhoods. The Museums often serve as a sort of ""concierge"" for the neighborhoods they are a part of, as guests often ask staff and volunteers for suggestions of where to eat, where to shop, and where to visit next. Museum staff is careful to recommend restaurants, shops, and destinations that are locally owned, reflect the character of the neighborhood, and will provide visitors with a great experience that will make the neighborhood a destination in the future. Some of the areas that see these guests include Waldo, Brookside, and the Ward Parkway Center.","Success of an event is measured in a variety of ways, including event attendance, verbal feedback at the event, and measurable event satisfaction, as collected through event surveys. Surveys are sent after all major events and are also available on site. General event satisfaction will also be recorded through on-the-spot evaluation of participation, engagement, and enthusiasm for various elements of the program. After all of our programs, staff, volunteers, and board work together to create an ""End of Activity"" report, which consolidates measurable event data (attendance, revenue, survey feedback), as well as a breakdown of what elements of a program worked well and what did not, both behind the scenes and during the program itself. These reports allow staff to analyze program satisfaction and make recommendations and adjustments for future programs.","All ticketed events will capture information such as phone number, email address, and physical address that will provide information on audience demographics. Guests to the Museums are also asked to sign a ""guest book"" which provides us with their city, state, and country information.","POINT (-94.593105 39.016538)","39.0168477 -94.5924727"

Its membership is exclusively Americans of Italian heritage, or married to those of Italian heritage, of good character and reputation, united together in a national chain, working jointly on national projects and separately on community activities, to uplift the prestige of our people. It is non-political and non-sectarian. The objectives of UNICO are: 1. To stimulate the desire of each member to be of service to his fellow man and society in general. 2.To encourage high ethical standards in business and professions. 3. To quicken the interest of each member in the public welfare of his community and to cooperate with others in its civic, social, commercial and industrial development. UNICO grants scholarship awards, promotes Italian Study Chairs, observes Columbus Day with fitting programs, participates in underprivileged and handicapped children's work, local charities, community and civic activities, mental health programs, Cooley's anemia programs, and promotes good fellowship among members. The name UNICO, translated from Italian, means ""one"" or ""only"" or ""only one of its kind"". Additionally, the letters are interpreted as U-Unity, N-Neighborliness, I-Integrity, C-Charity and O-Opportunity.","The Festa Italiana will be promoted by the Zona Rosa Shopping district in conjunction with area business sponsors and the Platte County Visitors' Bureau as a weekend family festival, with shopping and lodging. Zona Rosa will promote the Festa Italiana as well as its numerous shopping destinations through print advertising, radio advertising, social networking and on their website. Area lodging establishments including the Embassy Suites will promote the event to their guests. The Platte County Visitor's Bureau will use their marketing resources to promote the event on a regional basis.","UNICO has held the Festa Italiana at the Zona Rosa shopping district for eleven years. Zona Rosa has been excellent with which to work. They assist us each year in the layout of the event on their grounds. Making valuable recommendations in terms of best exposure and neighborhood feel. They have also assisted in promoting the event via their website, onsite promotion via large banners and kiosks, through their social media outlets, through newspaper ads and finally through radio promotions and onsite event interviews. The Zona Rosa shopping district is a destination for local residents and also for residents throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area and the region. UNICO has felt from the onset that Zona Rosa has a vested interest in the success of our event because our success is their success. Because our audience is from throughout the region it exposes new attendees to what Zona Rosa has to offer. These new attendees potentially will revisit the Zona Rosa shopping district to shop, dine and be entertained.","The Festa Italiana is also appealing to those visiting Kansas City, Missouri for several reasons. Many visitors to Kansas City are looking for a fun, family oriented, safe and relatively inexpensive activity to experience while visiting a city on vacation. The Festa Italiana offers them every thing on that list. In recent years the Festa Italiana was awarded as one of the best family oriented festivals in the Kansas City area. For families (young and old) who are looking to enjoy an evening out on the town the Festa is a perfect event. There is free admission, a beautiful venue, great family oriented entertainment, usually mild weather and wonderful food and beverage selection. Also visitors with a young family will find the 'Children's play area to be a relatively inexpensive way to entertain the family with face painting, balloon figure making, games and inflatables. For an older audience there is entertainment on the main stage that will keep you tapping your toes throughout the day and when you are tired of watching the entertainment you can browse the many vendors who are offering goods not found in retail stores. Finally for those who are of Italian-American descent there is a cultural and Italian heritage appeal to the event as they can immerse themselves in all that is Italian including food, song, language, history, products and culture.","The Festa Italiana is appealing to those living in Kansas City, Missouri for several reasons.

Finally there is an appeal to those who grew up in the old Italian American neighborhoods or who have family that grew up in those neighborhoods. The Festa Italiana represents the 2017 version of the old neighborhood festivals and family reunions. Many of the attendees come to the Festa to see old friends, relatives and neighbors.","The Festa Italiana will promote the Zona Rosa Shopping district by showing off the many amenities offered at the district. Festa attendees can not help but observe all of the nice characteristics of the district including the beautiful architecture and the many shopping options available. In addition there are many restaurants and outdoor cafe's which border the Festa event. Many visitors have commented in the past that the Zona Rosa Shopping district reminds them of the Kansas City Country Club Plaza shopping district. The Festa benefits Zona Rosa by bringing traffic and first time attendees to the district who are prone to repatronize the district by spending entertainment and shopping dollars there in the future.","The Kansas City Chapter of UNICO National has two main goals in producing the Festa Italiana. They are to promote our Italian-American culture and heritage and secondly to raise money for our scholarships and charities. On our first goal of promoting our Italian-American culture and heritage we use an informal measure to determine if we have been successful. The UNICO members ask attendees if they have enjoyed the event and if so 'what did they enjoy the most?'. UNICO also has a ""tell us what you liked and did not like"" box at our main information tent to receive feedback. Also there are many elders in our community who also serve as an informal barometer of our success. They are very vocal in letting us know if we have done a good job in promoting the Italian-American culture and heritage. The second goal is very simple to quantify. The bottom line for our second goal is did we make a profit or not. Do our proceeds exceed our expenses. UNICO establishes profit targets each year to coincide with the scholarship and charitable grants we would like to award. Over the years we have established a good following in the Kansas City area and have had eleven consecutive years of profits.","Over the past years the method that we have used to collect data on audience demographics, including persons who do not live in Kansas City, Missouri has been through an informal process of inquiring at the UNICO information booth. The UNICO information booth is located in a central location at the Festa Italiana and is used as the hub for questions about the entertainment schedule, location of food and craft vendors, what is UNICO, the UNICO raffle, first aid. ATM locations, restroom locations etc... As attendees engage with the UNICO information booth, UNICO members inquire about how they have heard about the event, where they reside,what do they like about the event and what they would like to see in the future. The UNICO Raffle is managed from the UNICO information booth and on the raffle ticket stub that we keep we capture name, address, email address and phone number of ticket purchasers. In addition we have UNICO members that act as ambassadors for the event and mingle through the crowd throughout the three days and as a point of emphasis inquire how attendees have heard about the event and where they are from.","POINT (-94.665312 39.251247)","39.2509445 -94.6655167"

Now planning our 12th year, the Kansas City Irish Fest was born of the merger of two successful, smaller neighborhood events, the Brookside and Westport Irish fests. Located in the heart of Kansas City on beautiful Crown Center Square, KCIF regularly hosts around 100,000 people throughout the weekend. Kansas City Irish Fest is not affiliated with, or a branch of, or managed by any retail or wholesale business, local or otherwise. We are not organized by, operated by or a chapter of any group, union or organization other than our own. KCIF is almost 100% volunteer staffed, and is grateful for the help of nearly 1000 volunteers annually.","Kansas City Irish Fest works closely with Visit KC to promote this event. Every year we purchase an ad in Visit KC's visitors guide as well as on their website. Kansas City Irish Fest also visits other Irish Fest's around the country all year long to learn to see what other festivals are doing along with promoting the Kansas City festival. Kansas City Irish Fest is also a member of the International Festival and Events Association. Every year we attend the conference and the executive director serves on the board.  Each year we submit for and win awards to further market the festival to a regional and national audience. Kansas City Irish Fest also works closely with the Irish government and Tourism Ireland to promote the festival internationally and is invited to attend several international conferences throughout the year. In 2017, 43 states were represented in attendance along with four countries (Ireland, Great Britain, Brazil and Canada).","Crown Center provides the use of their grounds, labor and electricity to Kansas City Irish Fest during the event.

Our strong marketing campaign and entertainment line up draw visitors to the event. Kansas City Irish Fest is the third largest Irish Fest in the country. Over 2500 room nights are booked under the Irish Fest room block at our partnering hotels and we do know that thousands more stay at other hotels as well as with friends and family.  This year people from 43 states and 4 countries attended the festival.","Well organized events benefit all of Kansas City by bringing communities together.

In the last couple of years Kansas City Irish Fest has worked on messaging to attract new festival goers by educating them on all that Kansas City Irish Fest has to offer. It's for all ages, ethnic groups, and people of all socio-economic backgrounds.","Successful, well run events at Crown Center have proven to be a strong draw with metropolitan and regional residents.

We encourage people to use the KC Streetcar to get to the event and then to explore Downtown Kansas City.  2500 hotel nights are booked under the Kansas City Irish Fest block so a large number of festival goers are spending multiple days in the downtown area.","We are able to measure our success on overall attendance, ticket sales, beverage sales, hotel rooms booked and expenditures vs. revenues in our budget. We receive a final report from our partnering hotels that show us the rooms booked and where they are from.  We have sold out of hotel rooms under the KCIF block for several years running and have had to reach out to additional hotel partners to secure enough rooms for the demand. We see this as a direct relation to our reputation and early marketing efforts. Also we have used the same online ticketing system for the past four years and are able to compare how sales are comparing from year to year. Our detailed budgets allow us to see where revenue was up and down from year to year and we conservatively budget for the current year. If revenues meet or exceed the budget numbers we find this to be  a good measure of knowing we are hitting goals and in turn having a successful event.","We estimate at least 30,000 attendees are from outside the KC area. We are able to get that info from our online ticket sales as well as our hotel sales.

The event was created in 2008 to raise health care expenses for local musician Abigail Henderson, who was diagnosed with Stage 3 inflammatory breast cancer. Abigail was a full-time musician without affordable access to health care, and recognized this void in her community. Propelled by the tremendous outpouring of support for her, she co-founded the nonprofit organization Midwest Music Foundation (MMF) to furnish area musicians with health care assistance. Though Abigail passed away in 2013, MMF continues her mission to invest in Kansas Citys musical artists.In addition to providing a number of events, programs and resources for the music community throughout the year, Apocalypse Meow is the organizations primary fundraiser. Since its inaugural year, the annual benefit concert has been held to raise money for Abbys Fund for Musicians Health Care. This fund was created in 2008 to provide emergency health care grants to musicians in the area, and has contributed more than $101,000 to 93 Kansas City musicians for health conditions including liver failure, cancer, broken bones and dental work.  MMF also partners with RockDocs, a collaboration of the University of Kansas and the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County at various events throughout the year, including Apocalypse Meow.  2018 will mark the third year they will be onsite at the event to offer health information, screenings, wellness programs, consultation and follow ups. In 2017, MMF and RockDocs hosted a Free Musicians Health Care Clinic as part of the NTDF supported Crossroads Music Festival.  Custom earplugs were provided to 21 area musicians and medical consultations/treatments were made to a total of 27 attendees.  We plan to make this an annual event.  MMF is also working to schedule the mobile mammogram vehicle for a future event to provide mammograms to female musicians.  The event showcases notable Kansas City-area bands alongside national touring acts, and has been held in various neighborhoods throughout the city, including Westport, Midtown and the Crossroads. 2018 will mark Apocalypse Meows 11th anniversary; it includes a free, kick-off show in Westport at Mills Record Company and the main event at recordBar, nestled between downtown and the Crossroads. A silent auction and raffle features prizes donated by an assortment of area businesses, including restaurants, media outlets, sports teams, venues, music stores and tattoo shops.

We believe that investing in the citys music scene is essential to supporting the broader arts sector of Kansas City. A city that fosters its arts community can help make it an attractive residence for artists. MMF will work with the Kansas City Area Development Council, Visit KC, Crossroads Community Association, Westport Regional Business League, and other civic development agencies to promote Apocalypse Meow. MMF has good relationships with local press outlets, and the event typically receives extensive radio, print and television coverage.",,"Because MMF and Apocalypse Meow receive a healthy amount of local media attention, non-residents interested in the arts and live music will be drawn to the event. Advertisements on local radio can also draw tourists to the event by highlighting each artist on the lineup and making listeners aware of the events philanthropic nature. Previous Apocalypse Meow artists are based in locales including Chicago and Austin, and have drawn attendees from other parts of the country, mostly through social media and word of mouth. The event appeals to supporters of live music, as it highlights these national touring acts while exposing audiences to the diversity of Kansas City-area musical talent. It also appeals to proponents of health care, especially those who work in the arts sector. MMF would like to use NTDF funding to expand promotion to these markets, which are out of our current scope.","Apocalypse Meow has become a much anticipated event for the Kansas City music community. The event features popular regional musical acts, many of whom have received national attention. The artists reside throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area, as well as surrounding cities like Lawrence, Joplin, Topeka, St. Joseph, Wichita, and Manhattan. The event is also supported by two local radio stations, KTBG 90.9 The Bridge and 90.1 KKFI, and has received press from The Kansas City Star, Ink, and The Pitch. With promotion from MMF, the music community and the media, Apocalypse Meow attracts residents across and beyond the metropolitan area. It is hopeful that other musicians and artists will continue to see the event as an opportunity to connect with the organization.","Apocalypse Meow attracts residents from all over the Kansas City metropolitan and neighboring communities, such as Lawrence, Manhattan, Topeka, Joplin, Wichita, and St. Joseph. Many of the attendees do not regularly attend events in Westport or the Crossroads, so this gives them the opportunity to explore these areas of the city and do additional business. MMF strives to support local businesses at all of its events and encourages our members to do the same. Many of the donations at Apocalypse Meow are from a variety of local businesses, including record stores, radio stations, breweries, sporting teams and tattoo shops. We will also reach out to area hotels to negotiate discounts for out-of-town attendees.","We have measured success through increasing attendance at each years event, and funds raised for Abbys Fund for Musicians Health Care. We re-evaluate the event each year and refine the logistics of the following event. Our event continues to gain attention each year.  At our November, 2017 event (in honor of our 10th anniversary), local filmmakers will debut a short documentary featuring interviews with past Abby's Fund grant recipients, MMF staff,  and Mayor Sly James.   We feel that this film will further elevate and bring attention to our event and lead to even greater future success.","Because Mills Record Companys kick-off show is a free event, demographics will be tracked through volunteer support. For the main event at Record Bar, sales will go through Ticketfly, a website that collects demographic information on ticket purchasers.In 2016, we had 241 pre-sale Ticketfly sales from 32 cities/towns in Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.  We anticipate similar numbers for our 2017 event that will take place November 3-5 and our 2018 event for which we are applying.  In addition, we had many more walk up sales for the event.  It is more difficult to track walk up sales, so we are promoting advance sales through a discount to buy tickets in advance.","POINT (-94.581153 39.095063)","39.095029 -94.5815067"

The 2018 Festival will increase those numbers by employing approximately 15 dancers and choreographers and reaching nearly 1,000 audience members. We set aside 25% of the tickets to offer for free or at discounted rates for students in our master classes, big/little pairs through Big Brothers Big Sisters and Girl Scouts.

Posters and fliers will begin going up all over the Kansas City area in April/May and will remain up until the Festival. The Co-Artistic Directors will make media appearances the week of the festival and ads will run through print and digital media such as the Kansas City Star and KCUR. Those who are already in Kansas City have a high chance of being reached through any of our marketing strategies. Additionally, the Arts Impact Study discovered that tourists to Kansas City are more likely to attend arts events in the city after hearing about it from those they are in town visiting. It is crucial to arts marketing to reach the widest audience possible to generate awareness for the events so they become active ambassadors of the arts in KC.","There are very few opportunities for Kansas Citians to attend professional dance performances in the summer months. Additionally, the repertoire KCDF produces is not being been done anywhere else in our region during any part of the year. For those who are dance enthusiasts, the KCDF main performance is the only time they will see this kind of dance or attend a professional dance show during the summer in our community. For those who just enjoy attending high-quality arts events, KCDF's main performance is just that. With modest ticket prices ($35, $45 & VIP $100) and discounted and complimentary tickets for those attending master classes or in the Big Brothers Big Sisters & Girl Scout programs, this is an affordable event for a diverse demographic of individuals.","The Kansas City Dance Festival will draw audience members to the Spencer Theatre through the neighborhoods around UMKC. If the neighborhood association agrees to support the event following the receipt of our letter with will work with them to develop ideas for how KCDF can promote the neighborhood association.","We will use the following outcome-based indicators to assess the success of the 2018 Festival: Outcome #1: Provide employment opportunities to professional dancers in during the summer.  Outcome Target #1: The 2018 Festival will employ a minimum of 12 dancers from all over the world. Outcome Indicator #1: Manage the number of dancers on the program.  Outcome #2: Provide the Kansas City community with professional dance opportunities during the summer.Outcome Target #2: Fill 85% of Spencer Theatre at the Main Event Outcome Indicator #2: Obtain ticket information from the CTO system at the Spencer Theatre Outcome #3:Cross-pollinate diverse dancers and choreographers to provide unique professional development opportunities. Outcome Target #3: Bring in world-renowned choreographers to work with professional dancers. Outcome Indicator #3: Survey the dancers after the Festival to evaluate the benefit of working on the Festival to their professional development.","For the past three years, the main event has taken place at the Folly Theatre. The ticketing system at the Folly Theater tracks residential demographics of those attending the performance. Unfortunately the ticketing system does not track demographics beyond residential so we must rely on staff observation at the show to asses additional demographics such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.","POINT (-94.579675 39.03765)","39.037018 -94.579668"

All will utilize a large contingent of volunteers from the Kansas City Police Department and from KC Vette Riders (an African American chapter of the Corvette Club of America whose members will come from several surrounding states, bringing their cars to show and providing volunteer support). The first event, to be held in September, will feature a 5K Walk/Run through the Ivanhoe neighborhood surrounding Harris Park. This will build on a similar event held in 2017 aimed af familiarizing outsiders with this inner-city neighborhood as they join with area residents in the walk. In addition to participating in a healthful activity, walkers will see the progress made by Harris Park in neighborhood beautification activities as well as observing first hand the amount of the work that is still needed to clean up this economically depressed area. In this way, organizers hope to attract the commitment of outsiders who can be tapped to join in these efforts. (Harris Park has always sought to educate and encourage the community to take pride and ownership in where they live and work and changing the mindset of the community through neighborhood beautification -- e.g., tearing down abandoned houses and cleaning up blighted vacant lots and turning them into green space.) The second event, to be held later in the fall, will introduce neighbors and outsiders to a fantastic new Pitch and Putt Golf Course at the Park, providing opportunities for attendees to join in recreational games and challenges and learn about golf through these activities. An additional group of volunteers will assist with this event: First Tee of Greater Kansas City is a new partner with Harris Park, bringing its well-regarded and successful program to youth in Kansas City's urban core. First Tee's mission is ""To impact the lives of young people by providing learning opportunities and educational programs that promote character development and life-enhancing values through the game of golf."" (A mission quite similar to that of Harris Park.) The third event, to be held in April 2019, will replicate the successful Basketball/Cheerleading Competitions held over the years since the Park was founded in 1999. During this event, 10 teams of 10 basketball players and 50 individual cheerleaders will compete for prizes. To be eligible to participate, the youth will attend an educational session. Besides exercise, the educational program will also stress the importance of healthful eating and will kick off a new Diabetes Prevention Program for Youth, now being planned. Entertainment will follow each of the program activities, utilizing adult performers who spent time at Harris Park when they were young and credit that experience for much of what they have been able to accomplish as adults.","3","3","Harris Park Midtown Sports & Activities Center","4029 Wayne Avenue","64110",,"Educational","The events will all be held at Harris Park located in the Ivanhoe Neighborhood. The Ivanhoe Neighborhood is bounded on the north by E31st Street and on the south by Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd. It is bounded on the east by Prospect and on the west by Paseo Blvd.  The Park comprises two city blocks on both sides of Wayne Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets. The Park is also in the target area of the Urban Neighborhood Initiative (UNI), one of the KC Chamber of Commerce's Big 5 ideas, and is run by a non-profit established to revitalize neighborhoods in the City's urban core.

Harris Park uses sports and special events to educate but these are only 5% of what we do. The other 95% is education, which is always part of the planning. For example we use basketball, cheer leading, volleyball, picnics -- and our new offering, golf -- as a way to attract and draw the community in. Once we have our audience, we incorporate the educational piece. Harris Park is a symbol of local neighborhood revitalization and beautification and serves as a model for Kansas City's urban core. The Park and its activities are regularly cited by civic leaders, and by newspaper, radio and television coverage, as offering an exemplary way to use space and activities. In addition to serving the neighborhood, Harris Park has long recognized the role it can play in introducing the neighborhood and its strengths and challenges to outsiders, both others from the greater Kansas City area and tourists from outside the region, and has hosted a number of successful events to this end.","A number of outside organizations have agreed to promote the proposed activities. Pepsico and other corporate sponsors will promote the participation of their employees in the 5K Walk/Run to be held in September -- as they did at last year's event. The KC Vette Riders, with members from around the country, will attend all events and publicize these through the Corvette Club of America website and other social media. The PGA has been a leader in supporting the development of the new Pitch and Putt Golf Course at Harris Park and will advertise the fall golf event through its media channels. First Tee will do the same. Truman Medical Centers and the Linwood YMCA are helping to plan the longer-term Diabetes Prevention Program for Youth to be kicked off at the spring event and will take leadership in not only offering the educational component at that event but for publicizing the event in their news outlets. Harris Park will ask the neighborhood associations around the City to also promote the events. In addition, Harris Park will obtain information on food and lodging options, and on sports and entertainment events taking place in KC at the time, and provide this to the KC Vette Riders and other participants in the project from outside the KC area.",,"The biggest appeal will be to members of the Corvette Club of America, who have participated in past events at the Park and who will be volunteering at each of these events. It is anticipated that 30 to 50 Corvette owners and family members will attend these gatherings. At each Corvette Club event, there is always a judged competition focusing on attributes of the cars entered. Trophies are given to the winners of the competition. In the past, these Corvette Club members attending from outside the area have spent an average of 2 nights in Kansas City, not only requiring lodging and food but also visiting other attractions in the City.","In addition to appealing to former residents of the area who return to the neighborhood from which they moved to visit family and friends still residing there and to experience the revitalization of the community, through this project non-residents would be drawn to the competitive activities which will constitute a part of each of the events. For example, those who like to compete in walk/run events might come to the September event, as they did last year. Those interested in golf might come to the fall kick-off event introducing the new Pitch and Putt Golf Course. These will likely include adults affiliated with the PGA who provided leadership in developing the beautiful state-of-the-art course, plus others serving as teachers/mentors through the First Tee. In addition youth from other areas living in the City who are involved with First Tee might come to see the new golf venue. Basketball players and cheerleaders from other areas might come to the ever-popular Basketball/Cheerleading Event in the spring. Family and friends of members of the Kansas City Police Department might also be attracted to any or all of these events as the police will be volunteering at each of these.","The activities highlight the efforts of the community to provide healthy and safe physical and educational activities for families, youth and children within their own neighborhood. The short-term benefits to the local residents are structured, supervised activities for at-risk youth and adults and an affordable, local outdoor venue not unlike similar activities provided at a distance from the local neighborhood. Longer-term, the neighborhood becomes a safer and cleaner place in which to live and work and play, and residents who take advantage of the Park's offerings can become healthier. The Park also provides a model that could be replicated throughout Kansas City wherever structure and supervision can be attained through public or private parks or through converting blight to play areas.","Registration information will be used to quantify numbers attending and who they are. After each event volunteers will interview participants to assess their self-reported learning from the educational offering and their satisfaction with the event. There will also be asked how they learned about the events and ways they think others could be attracted to future activities. They will also be queried regarding changes they think would enhance future offerings. A written questionnaire will be used to survey volunteers regarding their experience and suggestions for future events. There will be a ""station"" where others (such as neighbors, visitors) can stop to offer their impressions of the event. Observations will be noted.","All attending will register upon arrival. Information on zip code of residence, gender, and age will be collected. Attendees will check boxes to indicate if they are a) interested neighbors, b) participants, c) family or friends of participants, d) volunteers d) other (e.g., corporate sponsors or other donors to the Park, reps of news media, reps from partner organizations).","POINT (-94.56534 39.052959)","39.0529693 -94.5650822"

One hundred percent of Choristers who complete the program graduate from high school and matriculate into college. They often graduate with college credits, as well. Choristers demonstrate positive attitudes, poise and self-esteem due to the Social Skills training.

""The Producers"" skewers Broadway traditions and takes no prisoners! The original Broadway production won a record breaking 12 Tony Awards!  ""My Fair Lady"" is the musical by which all others are measured. Learner and Loewe's award-winning story of Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl transformed into an elegant lady, is widely considered to be one of the greatest musicals of all time. This production collected six Tony Awards, including ""Best Musical"", and the film version took home eight Oscars.  ""Showboat"" is one of the most influential musicals in history. ""Showboat"" redefined how musical stories were told. The landmark collaboration between Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the Cotton Blossom, A Mississippi River show boat, over 40 years from 1887 to 1927.  ""A Spectacular Christmas Show"" is a fun, family-friendly holiday show that has become a tradition for thousands of families in Kansas City. This show is an original revue featuring innovative arrangements of holiday classics and holiday music taken from musical theater.

Last year we hired and paid 321 performers, musicians, and tech positions to support our season's productions. That is by far the most among local theater companies.

Fiesta Hispana presents more than 75 professionally designed fiesta booths with food vendors selling a variety of authentic foods. Other booths offer internationally imported jewelry, clothes, activities, consumer information, employment opportunities, health services, and more. Among these array of booths, there is also a large children's area which provides special activities for small children and their parents. With Fiesta Hispana 2017, a new partnership was formed with the NFL Play 60 & the Kansas City Chiefs. In addition to honoring Hispanic Heritage Month, the NFL/KC Chiefs promoted their NFL Play 60 campaign to encourage kids to be active for 60 minutes a day in order to help reverse the trend of childhood obesity. Activities were available for kids  to participate in with the help of the Kansas City Chiefs Cheerleaders, KC Wolf, and former Chiefs players. We will continue this partnership and expand it further by recruiting area schools to participate in the NFL Play 60 acitivities over the weekend to help promote child obesity in the Kansas City area.In addition to participation from the KC Chiefs, the Kansas City Royals also participated in Fiesta Hispana. Representative from the Royals Charities were on-site and throughout the weekend, volunteers passed out over 5,000 baseball card sets to children.

FACEBOOK - Marketing strategies/techniques had been ramped up this past year concentrating on Facebook users and the power of the ""share"" and ""tag"" features. Six weeks before the Fiesta, postings had begun to tease the audience of details that would be released within the next few days - this allowed the audience time to ""share"" and ""tag"" their friends and family that would be interested - which leads those friends to ""share"" and ""tag"" also. During this time, we announced national headliners that would be taking the stage, as well as,  their bios and songs to remind them and/or introduce them to the artist. Sponsors were also posted on daily basis with their logos. The week before Fiesta, we posted videos of the Headliners promoting and inviting them to Fiesta Hispana on the day they were to perform.

Several organizations have expressed the need to change the way in which business is done with Fiesta, however, we have not been able to generate additional funds for Advertising which has resulted in advertising being done on these forms of media to only two weeks prior to Fiesta. WEBSITE - Over the past several years, Fiesta has had an issue with updating and maintaining the website . This past year, we partnered with an organization that offered to create a new website as part of their sponsorship. We are very thankful to now have a site that functions and serves its purpose. During all advertising and posts prior to Fiesta, we made it a point to direct everybody to the website for additional information. Our next goal is to update the site to include information on Hispanic Heritage Month to educate the public on all the different countries that celebrate their Independence Day during this month.

We work directly with the Kansas City Sports Commission and Student Youth Travel market to promote our youth sports tournaments. In conjunction with that, Nets Developmental League partners with the Adam's Mark Hotel Water Resort, 9103 E. 39th Street, Kansas City Missouri 64133, as our host hotel for all Nets Developmental League events.  Furthermore, we plaster the NTDF logo on all promotional material and we work with the city's Arts Marketing Coordinator to get the word out on our events.",,"50-65% of the participants and spectators are people who do not live in Kansas City, Missouri but have traveled to be apart of the tournament.  Over half of our attendance is from out of state to attend our tournament.  Our tournaments appeal to many spectators who would visit Kansas City, Missouri to see the talent of youth players that we have participating in our tournaments.  Youth sports is a billion dollar industry if you factor in (apparel, travel, lodging and entertainment), so quality youth tournaments are very attractive to many people and in demand.  Nets Developmental League has become a brand for quality youth tournaments.","The tournament itself is the appeal to person living in Kansas City, Missouri.  The majority of the youth baseball teams that will participate in the ""1st Annual Swing the Sticks"" will come from baseball teams in the Kansas City Metropolitan.

With that being the case, we create a lot of traffic throughout the neighborhoods where the tournament is being held and this allows visitors to experience those neighborhoods.  Furthermore, these visitors frequent the local restaurants, convenient stores, lodging and entertainment within these neighborhoods.","Our method of measuring success and the events effectiveness is tied into the overall financial success of the event.  Nets Developmental League is a nonprofit organization that must be able to generate revenue to assist underprivileged youth in sports, and f our events don't generate a profit, then Nets Developmental League can't operate.  Furthermore, we need teams to return for future tournaments and we have a very high return rate from teams participating in our tournaments.  We do provide ""feedback"" cards at the end of each tournament to coaches, which allows Nets Developmental League to continue to improve our tournaments (product).","*Wrist bands used for admission is 85% estimate on attendance.

The fifth festival will be held on Sunday June 10, 2018 and will turn a spotlight on youth performances and family-friendly programming while engaging diverse new audiences in the arts, including regional tourists.  It also supports the growth of future artists with a focus on youth aged 4-18. Approximately 35 free performances take place on four stages from 11 am to 4 pm, placing 600-700 young people from 25 or more youth groups on stage.   Selected through a competitive process, groups rehearse for months.  At the festival they perform before what is probably their largest audience ever and enjoy the same experience that professional adult performers at the Kauffman Center receive. Each performance is less than a half-hour long, so audiences can sample a number of art forms.Emphasis is placed on identifying a broad range of performers representing diverse cultures, a variety of art forms and ages.   Genres of the 26 performing groups at the 2017 festival ranged from an African-American boys and girls choirs to a martial arts performance group, from a Shakespeare camp to a youth ballet, from a Suzuki strings program to a jazz band.  At the 2017 festival, 40% of the performing groups were comprised predominantly of minority artists.  Short performances or interactive classes are offered by the Centers three resident companies (KC Ballet, KC Symphony and the Lyric Opera of Kansas City) exposing audiences to the type of excellent performances they might see at the Kauffman Center.  The festival atmosphere is enhanced by pop-up performances around the building and grounds. In 2017 artists from StoneLion Puppet Theatre interacted with guests using marionettes.  The Last Carnival Circus School and Lucia Aerial performed acrobatics on the new Community Partner Stage.  Heart of America Shakespeare Festival hosted several sessions of En Gard Bard, a workshop on the art of staged fight scenes. Drum Safari engaged crowds in drum circles on the south lawn. The KC Symphony offered their popular Instrument Petting Zoo. Great American Kites & Events flew some of their gigantic kites.  Two painted pianos from Keys 4/4 Kids were strategically placed to invite guests to play. New this year, the KC Ballet hosted a dance workshop where guests learned a short dance routine and performed on the Community Partner Stage.Interactive arts activities are offered at numerous stations.  Kansas City Chalk and Walk Festival that turns the north sidewalk between the two halls into a colorful canvas.  The Mattie Rhodes Arts Center offered a traditional Hispanic cultural activity and a sculpture arts project was provided by the Nelson-Atkins. The American Institute of Architects asked participants to ""Design YOUR KC"" with recycled materials.  The Lyric Operas Magical Wardrobe invited children to try on real opera costumes and play with props.","4","4","Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts","1601 Broadway","64108","All events take place at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts and the contiguous Arts District Garage Terrace.","Cultural","Crossroads Community Association","5000","500","Annual","15000","5058","5058","180272","The Kauffman Centers vision is to enrich the lives of everyone in our community through extraordinary and diverse performing arts experiences.  Our mission is to accomplish this through: 1) PROGRAMS:  showcasing a wide variety of high quality programs through our resident companies, community partnerships and national and international artists and productions; 2) CUSTOMER SERVICE: working to create devoted constituents by providing a welcoming and accessible environment, going the extra mile to make the customer comfortable and serving everyone with dignity; and 3) EDUCATION: nurturing a love of the arts for present and future generations, promoting and developing creativity through programs, activities, and performances, facilitating a cultural environment and bridging gaps between the arts and needs of individuals (children, youth, and adults), families, organizations and communities.","Staff work regularly with VisitKC on many aspects of the Kauffman Centers work.  Future Stages Festival is listed on the VisitKC calendar and promoted through their social media channels and e-mail communications.  The Kauffman Center has sponsor relationships with several local hotels (Hotel Phillips and the Marriott) that share information with guests and constituents.  In addition, an extensive social media campaign leading up to the event reaches beyond the Kansas City area to promote attendance.",,"According to research conducted by VisitKC, a record high number of 25.2 million people visited Kansas City in 2016 (most recent data available).  Within that group, 28% of trips to Kansas City included cultural activities and attractions.  Four percent of daytime visitors surveyed indicated that exhibits and festivals are a top activity.Given these statistics, it can be surmised that visitors are looking for free cultural activities/attractions and festivals to attend.  One can expect that activities at the Kauffman Center are often researched by visitors.  Therefore, a free festival during the summer when concerts and performances are more limited in number may attract considerable attention from visitors.This is in addition to the nonresidents who will come to watch their grandchildren or friends perform during the Future Stages Festival.","The Kauffman Centers vision is to enrich the lives of everyone in our community through extraordinary and diverse performing arts experiences.  Future Stages Festival is on point with every single aspect of our mission.  It showcases high quality performances of community partners (youth groups and professional companies), creates a welcoming environment for youth performers, their families and friends, and celebrates the talents of and supports the education of young artists.  These young people have their love for the arts validated as they are treated like professional performers in every way.Youth performing at Future Stages Festival come from neighborhoods all over the city, therefore the parents, friends and neighbors who come to see them perform are also drawn from those neighborhoods.  In addition, the very structure of a festival like this, with many activities to choose from, the ability to move in and out of activities and performances on ones own schedule, is attractive to residents, particularly those with children.  So Future Stages Festival, with its many young performers and flexible schedule, set at a venue that is lovely and welcoming, has the ability to attract residents from neighborhoods around the community.At the 2017 festival, 40% of the performing groups were comprised predominantly of minority artists.  23% of the performing groups featured African-American artists.  Therefore, audiences drew heavily from the neighborhoods where these young people live and attend school.  To help spread the word about Future Stages Festival even further, the Kauffman Center reaches out to more than 175 diverse organizations, including nonprofits (including all of the KCMO community centers), social service agencies (e.g. United Way, Calvary Community Outreach), library branches around the city, hotels, and churches.  Volunteers make calls to promote the festival and deliver postcard fliers that can be distributed to constituents.  Email fliers go out to the Kauffman Centers 80,000 person distribution list, including schools who attend matinees at the Center.","The Kauffman Center provides prominent placement for the Crossroads Community Associations Crossroads Truck in the south driveway on the day of the event.  Volunteers from the association staff the truck throughout the day and have the opportunity to promote their neighborhood activities and to interact with guests.  The neighborhood group is also listed as a partner in the festivals print program. The Festival adds yet another opportunity to bolster the Crossroads neighborhoods reputation as a center of arts activities and support its growth and development.Last years survey of 370 visitors indicated that 31% had not previously been to the Kauffman Center. This would indicate that they might not have visited the Crossroads Art District either.  Therefore, the festival has the side benefit of introducing visitors to the neighborhood and making them feel comfortable in returning to neighborhood activities like First Fridays or the annual Crossroads Block Party.  Also, Festival participants will park, eat and shop in the Crossroads Arts District before and after the festival. Visitors will feel more comfortable coming to the Crossroads in the future and have new reasons to do so.","Engagement:  To engage 25 diverse youth performing groups and 300-600 youth performers.  (Participation range exists since applicant youth groups can have any number of participants and final count is not known until after the selection process.) In 2017, there were 26 youth groups and 759 performers aged 4-18. Attendance:  To attract 5-6,000 guests.  To attract youth (ages 4-18) and their families who: 1) have not previously been to a performance at the Kauffman Center; 2) are unlikely to visit without first being oriented to and welcomed at the venue.   (2017 = 5,000 guests)  The Center places an usher at all three entrance points to count arrivals. Demographics:  To attract diverse, new audiences to the Kauffman Center that: 1) are traditionally underserved (i.e. may not feel that they can afford tickets to a performing arts event);  2) are part of a minority group underrepresented at current Kauffman Center events or 3) from outside the region and have not yet attended a performance. At the 2017 festival, 40% of the performing groups were comprised predominantly of minority artists (primarily African-American, Asian and Hispanic).  Therefore, audiences drew heavily from the neighborhoods where these groups are based and where participants live.  Both the diversity and age range of attendees was considerably more broad than that of a regular Kauffman Center activity.  Of attendees, 9.7% lived outside the 14-county metropolitan area, indicating the ability of the festival to attract broad audiences.Evaluation methods:  Staff keep data on all aspects of the program (number of performing groups, performances, ethnic composition of groups).   Participating groups are surveyed after the festival to provide feedback about the experience for the performers, how the festival might be improved and to collect impact data about the effect of the festival on their organizations growth and development.  Other evaluation methods are explained in the question about audience demographics.","A one-to-one person survey is conducted by Kauffman Center staff during the event.  In 2017, 370 individuals were interviewed and asked four questions:  What is the zip code where they live, how many people were in their party, whether they had visited the Kauffman Center before or not and if they had come to see a particular group/performer on stage.In addition, individuals who registered online to attend are sent a SurveyMonkey survey with these questions and more. Overall participation data is collected at the three main entrances by volunteers who count arriving patrons.",,"39.0941843 -94.5875135"

The OriginKC: New Works Festival attracts non-resident attendees who are theatre industry professionals and some who are simply theatre lovers.

Out-of-town visitors, including the playwrights, directors, and actors integral to the festival, will stay in nearby hotels and apartment housing and visit popular Kansas City attractions. Because the OriginKC: New Works Festival features two shows running back-to-back on one stage, audience members are likely to pay two visits during the festival and will naturally gain familiarity with and comfort visiting the downtown area, inspiring return visits. 2019 will be the fourth year of this festival, an event that KCRep will be producing and growing for years to come. As the festivals reputation grows it will attract more patrons each year, perpetuating the positive cycle of introduction, increased familiarity, and repeat visits.

In November 2016 in Palm Springs, the Mid America Freedom Band was selected by the LGBA's assembly of delegates to be the host band for the 2018 conference. MAFB's conference bid called ""There's No Place Like Home"" beat out Denver's Mile High Freedom Band to bring the conference to Kansas City from May 2327, 2018. An estimated 250-400 musicians from around the globe and their guests will attend the conference to perform their choice of three ensembles, conduct LGBA business, and to experience the vibrant arts and cultural scene of Kansas City.The InterContinental serves as the host hotel with meeting and rehearsal space. The jazz band performs on Friday, May 25 at the Lyric Opera of Kansas City in the Crossroads and the two massed concert bands perform on Saturday, May 26 at Helzberg Hall in the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Registration is open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless if they perform in an LGBA organization or not. Personnel for all the ensembles will be drawn from those registered for the conference. Everyone who is registered and wishes to participate will perform. There are no auditions for the concert bands. Each concert band will be over 100+ players. Personnel for the jazz band will be selected from a pool of nominated candidates. The Friday and Saturday evening concerts will be ticketed and open to the public. ""There's No Place Like Home,"" a quote from that quintessential regional movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" hints at the repertoire to be performed and highlights our Kansas City as a global cultural center. The jazz band will perform selections celebrating Kansas City's rich jazz heritage from the past to present. Repertoire for the two concerts bands heavily features living, regional composers as Kansas City is a hot-bed of musical creation. Among those regional composers programmed are Chen Yi, Zhou Long, Derek Jenkins, Ingrid Stolzel, Randall Standridge, Aleks Sternfeld-Dunn, and Daniel Morel. Other composers include Harold Arlen, Claude T. Smith, Carlos Surinach, Jennifer Higdon, Aaron Copland, and Carmen Dragon. Aligning with MAFB's mission, this conference emphasizes works by those typically under-represented on the concert stage including LGBTQ+, female-identifying, and composers of color. One of the concert bands will work with acclaimed saxophonist Alastair Wright on Missouri's own Claude T. Smith's impressive ""Fantasia for Alto Saxophone and Concert Band"" and the other band partners with Musica Vocale, a local community choir, to perform rare works for concert band and choir.  Local jazz singer Eboni Fondren is the featured soloist with the jazz ensemble.More information, registration, and the complete program listings can be found at www.lgba2018.com.","4","4","Intercontinental, Kauffman Center, Lyric Opera","401 Ward Parkway","64112","InterContinental Kansas City at the Plaza401 Ward ParkwayKansas City, MO 64112Lyric Opera of Kansas City1725 Holmes StreetKansas City, MO 64108Helzberg Hall, Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts1601 Broadway BoulevardKansas City, MO 64108","Cultural","The InterContinental is in Sunset Hill census area of the South Plaza (with no associated Neighborhood or Homes Association directly assigned to that parcel).The Lyric Opera of Kansas City is part of the Crossroads Community Association in the Hospital Hill census area.The Kauffman Center is also part of the Crossroads Community Association in the Crossroads census area.","800","300","One-Time Event","23000","17768","17768","180272","Mid America Freedom Band provides opportunities for instrumental music lovers to share their passion of performance with the diverse community of Kansas City.

VisitKC produced a promotional video featuring Mayor Sly James extolling the myriad reasons to pick Kansas City including its perfect HRC score, vibrant cultural scenes, historical importance, modern amenities like the street car, culinary fortitude, and other such attractions. The InterContinental was an early partner in the process, providing reduced group-rate rooms and the Kauffman Center and Lyric Opera extended their booking window calendars to ensure this conference will be a success.A corporate sponsorship package was developed by SupportKC and has been sent to many local businesses including those of the Mid America Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, those close to the host hotel on the Plaza, and concert venues.MAFB is encouraging out-of-town visitors to rent a car, use a cab, or ride-share company to best explore KC. Charter buses will be used to shuttle participants from the hotel to the performance venues. This contract is still in the bidding process.Targeted social media postings have been scheduled with early emphasis on getting people to register with a conversion to ticket sales for the public performances occurring closer to the conference dates. Additional electronic and print advertisements will be forthcoming to push ticket sales.",,"The Kauffman Center is a big draw to potential performing members as it has been hailed as one of the top concert halls in the world. It is rare that community/amateur musicians get an opportunity to perform in such a venue. Kansas City will be the most affordable conference for flights, hotel, and food of recent and forthcoming conferences (Palm Springs 2016, Houston 2017, Orlando 2019) making it cost-effective for out-of-town participants. Dan Gailey, director of the jazz band is well known in jazz circles and is a draw for those looking to work with him. Alastair Wright is one of the top five saxophonists in the world after the results one of the most recent international competitions. The programmed, living composers will all be in attendance and so for many performers that is a big deal to get to work with those who wrote the music you're performing.The closest LGBA members that will potentially bring the most participants are Denver, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Dallas. LGBA has member bands across the US, Australia, and Canada for whom this will be the major parent organization's event of the year since LGBA rescinded its support of GayGames 2018 in Paris. Additionally, last year's conference in Houston had to be canceled due to Hurricane Harvey and so it will have been over a year since LGBA met as a group and over another year until they meet again in October 2019 in Orlando. These facts bode well for this 2018 conference. and early registration numbers are indicating high levels of interest from those traveling to Kansas City.","MAFB has a dedicated base of concertgoers with attendance at its regular season concerts ranging between 80% occupancy to standing-room only.  We anticipate these KC regional concertgoers to be even more motivated to get to hear MAFB and the LGBA musicians perform in the Kauffman Center and at the Lyric Opera of Kansas City's rehearsal space in the Crossroads. Those are larger venues and by partnering with Musica Vocale we will be attracting their typical concert goers as well. With Eboni Fondren as the featured soloist for the jazz band, we will capitalize on her name recognition as we have in the past with two sold-out performance at City Stage Union Station for the Kansas City Fringe Festival.Being at the Kauffman Center brings more appeal for performing members. As the event is open to anyone who wishes to register, regardless of LGBA affiliation, gives those willing to play quality music by esteemed local talent an opportunity to do so in a world-class venue. Performing local composers, many of whom have their own following, will attract those audiences. Invitations to the concert will be extended to all local community and school bands and choirs.This is the first time an LGBA conference has been hosted in Kansas City and local LGBTQ+ partner organizations are seeing this an important opportunity to reach a broader market.","""There's No Place Like Home"" will bring an estimated 250-400 musicians and their guests to the Plaza and Crossroads neighborhoods. The InterContinental, as the host hotel, has offered participants a rate of $175/night for single through quad occupancy.  Most participants will be need a three-night stay with an unrealistic low estimation for all quad occupancy equaling $32,000+ to the highest of all single occupancy at $210,000. The realistic expectation, based on occupancy at past conferences, will place total room expenses at $125,000-175,000. All these participants will need to eat providing revenue to primarily Plaza and Crossroad restaurants. Non-performing guests will have ample time to explore and spend money in the shops of the Plaza and surrounding neighborhoods. These guests will be provided with recommended stops, shops, points of interest, and eateries when they register with guided tours to art museums, BBQ joints, brewery/distilleries, jazz spots, coffeeshops, fountains, and more being offered depending on interest.At registration each participant will be given a welcome packet including coupons to bars and restaurants and sight-seeing guides. Social media posts to have already been highlighting the various food options from BBQ to vegan and they are receiving a lot of interest among potential visitors.","Satisfaction surveys about the conference are sent to participants about a week after the conference concludes by LGBA who in turn reports the findings to MAFB. Audience satisfaction will be asked on the demographic survey.MAFB will measure the success of the conference by attendance numbers of participants, audience members, and guests. Additional measures of success include: Was the event fiscally responsible and within budget expectations. Why or why not? Artistically, was the program well received and performed? This value judgement will be made by the artistic director with consultation from the guest directors and conductors. A CD will be made of the live performance and will offer much insight into the integrity of the performances. The composers in attendance will be asked for honest feedback and if they were pleased with how LGBA performed their works? What is the potential of MAFB for hosting such an event in the future (5 years? 7 years? 10 years?) This question will be asked after examining the financials and from MAFB member and audience feedback.","Participants will be given a paper demographic survey at the first rehearsal/meeting to collect information including age, zip code, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, income, and education levels. Audience members will be provided with the same survey at both the Friday evening jazz performance and the Saturday evening concert band performance in their programs. Participant return rates are anticipated to be above 70% and audience return rates, based on past models, are above 30%. During the registration process, all participants' zip codes are collected and audience members when purchasing their tickets will also provide that information.","POINT (-94.592655 39.039659)","39.0388882 -94.5931581"

The production will run for 12 performances and approximately 1200 audience members from the greater Kansas City metro area and the Midwest region are expected to attend.  One of Simon's most popular works, THE ODD COUPLE is the story of two newly single mismatched friends who become erstwhile roommates. While driving each other crazy, their friendship is tested, ultimately learning that they are better for knowing each other and determining that friendship counts. Felix Ungar, a neurotic, neat freak news-writer (a photographer in the television series), is thrown out by his wife, and moves in with his friend Oscar Madison, a slovenly sportswriter. Despite Oscar's problems  careless spending, excessive gambling, a poorly kept house filled with spoiled food  he seems to enjoy life. Felix, however, seems utterly incapable of enjoying anything and only finds purpose in pointing out his own and other people's mistakes and foibles. Even when he tries to do so in a gentle and constructive way, his corrections and suggestions prove extremely annoying to those around him. Oscar, his closest friend, feels compelled to throw him out after only a brief time together, though he quickly realizes that Felix has had a positive effect on him.A celebration of friendship and laughter, MET's production of THE ODD COUPLE will feature an all local cast anchored by Tony Beasley in the role of Felix Unger. MET audiences have enjoyed Tony in several performances and will thrill to see him back on stage in this wonderful role. 10 public performances in the Warwick are planned and two student matinees. An extension week will be written into contracts allowing for additional performances if audience demand takes off.

MET's Main Street Billboard featuring each show receives more than 78,000 impressions each week. Each play is advertised in our full-season flyer mailed in the fall and spring. THE ODD COUPLE will be advertised in all our Season 14 material, going out this spring. The list, generated from actual ticket sales over the years and expanded through a partnership with the Kansas City Rep, covers more than 52 counties of Missouri and Kansas as well as addresses from other states. Another 10,000+ mailing to theatre patrons is planned for the spring of 2018, which will feature the additional 6 plays of the 7-production season. MET places ads in programs passed out at other major arts performances for the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, the Kansas City Ballet, and New Theatre Restaurant. We market to unique audiences as well, identifying correlative interest groups who might enjoy specific performances. Growing our audiences and supporting this regional marketing effort is a major priority. Two part-time staff members assist with our efforts, and two full-time employees support our marketing efforts and provide the creative material for audience development efforts. As a sponsor of the season, NTDF will be mentioned as a presenting sponsor on all print and digital media.",,"MET seeks to attract adults, seniors, young professionals and students living in our region (within about a 3-hour drive of Kansas City) to our plays, and tourists and business travelers who may be here for a different reason but are attracted to our theatre. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City; they return again and again. Theatre lovers visiting the City for business or pleasure will find us because they like high quality, professionally produced plays. Intriguing themes or the opportunity to see a famous play will also attract the more casual theatre goer. Tickets (adult) average $35 each affordable for most any pocketbook - are a good value for visitor dollars. Casually dressed visitors and patrons and those in evening wear mingle comfortably at our come-as-you-are venue. We believe METs online presence will be the primary avenue used to attract regional patrons or tourists/business travelers to one or more plays during the season. Each play will be listed in area print calendars and in online event calendars, such as the VisitKC.com website. We will place online ads in KC STUDIO magazine, Ink, and other digital outlets. We are also using targeted Google and Facebook ads with Facebook ads being very effective. METs extremely lively social media platform produces great results, now up to 4,500 likes on our Facebook page, and we market via Twitter, Instagram and our own website. Online reviews of our plays during the run will be available at the Kansas City Star, The Pitch, Broadway World Kansas City and KCMETROPOLIS.org. Travelers may also see a print ad or review in the Kansas City Star, Ink or The Pitch; or pick up a flyer distributed by staff and volunteers to local coffee shops or hotels. We are in the process of contacting tourism and business and leisure travel promotional organizations within a three-hour radius of Kansas City, to explore promotional opportunities in cities such as Des Moines, Omaha, Wichita, Lincoln, Joplin, Columbia and Topeka. Kansas City television and radio stations also cover a broad regional market, so our interviews and ticket giveaways will reach nearby smaller cities and towns. Our ads will be in programs passed out at other major arts performances (e.g. the Kansas City Rep, the Lyric Opera, etc.). Our marquee on the front of the Warwick receives 78,000 impressions each week from residents and visitors alike. NTDF ads on Kansas City Streetcar kiosks will promote the event to travelers as well. THE ODD COUPLE will be marketed via a 10,000+ area theatre patron mailing later this spring and will be marketed on our website and Facebook page in our season announcement.","Each MET season offers something for everyone of any age and from all walks of life. THE ODD COUPLE is a well-known comedy that appeals to audiences of all ages. Our target audiences include adults, young professionals, seniors and students. METs 2018-2019 season covers a broad spectrum of palettes, for audiences that enjoy thought provoking plays to those that enjoy lighter material. We also represent our city on the stage by choosing pieces that reflect the cultural diversity of our community. Kansas City, Missouri residents and those from other metro area communities will attend because they wish to see a famous play or musical that they have never seen before, because they simply love professional theatre, or because something about a theme or subject intrigues them and they want to see what the play is all about. MET is also unique among local theatre companies given a combination of three features. First, we produce major masterworks and contemporary classics - plays or musicals that are award-winning and famous, but rarely produced in Kansas City because they are presumed to be too difficult or too expensive. Each season we offer an average of one play or musical premiere for Kansas City audiences. Second is trademark living room lobby, beautifully realized in our new home, the Warwick Theatre. Third is our intimate audience seating arrangement, with patrons within 3- 30 feet of the stage. We are excited to welcome our patrons and visitors to our new home; although it will look different, the experience will be the same familiar feeling they expect when coming to MET. Instead of a static stage and seating, the seating and stage change for each production. Audience members tell us they love these features, which is why it is so important to us to maintain them in the Warwick Theatre! MET offers extraordinary arts and culture experiences to the next generation. THE ODD COUPLE will occur during the 2018-2019 school year, so we are recruiting local school districts to bring their students for student matinees. We know that around 50% of students at our student matinees have never been to a live theatre performance. Perhaps some of these students will pursue theatre careers or become theatre lovers through student matinees. During the 2016-17 season, we began a post-show talk back for the final Thursday performance of each play. We have found that added feature to be a stimulating draw for our audience and some patrons that attended on a different day come back to participate in the talk backs. MET audiences are extremely literate, curious and engaged. They revel in the opportunity to discuss plays, their relevance and to learn about each other. This season we're expanding our marketing plan to use online and print ads in a variety of electronic and print publications, social media, mailings to our patrons and those of the theatre community in Kansas City, ads in programs of other Kansas City performing arts orgs., and radio and tv promos.","The presence of MET at the Warwick anchors Midtown as a burgeoning live theatre district in KC, inviting the community to share the joy inspired by exceptional performers who bring extraordinary stories to life! We are thrilled to open Season 14 in the Warwick Theatre, our new home near 39th and Main. We have moved our staff, volunteer offices, and season of productions to inaugurate the first season held at the Warwick Theatre with THE ODD COUPLE. In addition to bringing an exciting new venue online for theatre, art, and civic events, METs presence improves the safety of our neighborhood and increases visibility and traffic to the Midtown area all year long, making it a regular destination for returning patrons and drawing new visitors to our area. There are many new thriving businesses in our area; several of these are natural partners for our theatre. We are cross marketing with local restaurants, pubs, and hotels, as well as providing a pub atmosphere of our own. We are continuing our presence with VisitKC, as well. Old Hyde Park Historic District and MSCID/MainCor have each provided letters of support. While neither group will have a role in organizing or hosting the event, Old Hyde Park will promote the event at their neighborhood general meeting. SCID/MainCors mission does not include organizing or hosting other events. However, we have co-marketed with MainCor via a special discount code to their members for tickets. Old Hyde Park and MSCID/MainCor have been terrifically enthusiastic about our presence here on Main Street. In August, we are planning to have an event at the Warwick to bring together area businesses and to promote upcoming events. Getting to know everyone on a more personal basis will help encourage our ongoing collaboration. METs production of THE ODD COUPLE will run for 12 public performances, not only offering cultural opportunities for residents, but drawing visitors from other parts of the metro area and surrounding communities to the Old Hyde Park Historic District, to the Main Street Community Improvement District, and to other dining, music, and art venues in the District. Through conversations with our patrons we have been able to glean some valuable information about their leisure activities. We learned that slightly more than half of our audience visited local establishments (restaurants and taverns) before attending an evening show and around 37-40% went out after an evening performance. We know from conversations with our patrons that for many non-residents, MET plays are the reason for their first time visit to this part of the City. MET is a strong contributor to Kansas Citys lively arts, cultural, and entertainment matrix. We are excited that as we grow, we contribute to the growth of our neighbors as well.","MET measures success in three ways: audience attendance, artistic excellence and patron participation. As noted above, we can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season and track where the patron lives. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster or other factor. Trends and correlations are regularly reported to our board and used to determine what works and what may need to be changed. Our analysis led to an expansion of the senior discount ticket to every performance this season, and introduction of a Young Professional (under 39) discounted, anytime ticket. These changes resulted in increased attendance from both groups. Artistic excellence is evaluated constantly to always achieve our artistic best. From selection of great plays, premieres and classics, casting exemplary artists, anchoring each production with a crack shot artistic team and bringing the best of our art form to the MET stage, to presenting our plays in the most dynamic ways possible, MET achieves artistic excellence. This commitment to excellence has paid off with a strong reputation for outstanding work and notable critical reviews from print and online reviewers, as well as frequent praise in social media posts. Audience behavior is a huge indicator of artistic success. Their engagement, participation and increased attendance in ancillary events created around the play indicates strong interest and appreciation for our work. We have a good track record of repeat attendance from first time attendees and many of them convert to season ticket holders. We also now have two dozen long-term partners, members of our audience who have purchased a lifetime ticket. Our volunteer base is continuing to grow and change with the renovation of the Warwick. We are seeing more participation from families and men. Audience talk back sessions following the last Thursday evening performance of a play is an increasingly popular method for our actors and audience members, plus theme experts when appropriate, to have a lively discussion around each plays topic. Social media traffic is an exceptional way for us to measure success. It encourages patron engagement through opportunities to ask thought-provoking questions, post educational information, show behind the scenes pictures and keep patrons up-to-date with show schedules. We have seen a drastic increase of social media traffic through the analytic updates sent to us by social media providers. Related to social media outreach, our audience has shown a significant increase of patrons 18-35 years of age. Social media is a fantastic platform to interact with audiences and has been shown to pique the interest of the 35-55 age demographic, as well.","MET currently uses the Vendini ticketing system through which we collect and store data on each ticket purchaser. When a ticket is sold online, the patron self-identifies as an adult, young adult (under age 39), senior, or student. Their name, address, and phone number are also recorded in the system, and of course the particular play or musical attended. Box office staff collects the same information when tickets are purchased over the phone or at the door and the information is entered into the Vendini patron database. Using Vendini data, MET can track total attendance for an individual play or a whole season, and track whether the patrons lived in Kansas City, Missouri or in specific cities near or far away. These are just a few analyses made by MET staff. We also determine trends such as whether certain types of plays, ticket prices, or even nights of the week appear to be correlated with a particular age group, geographic cluster, or other factor. The data allow us to conduct targeted marketing for future plays as well, such as mailings to patrons that appear to prefer comedies, dramas, or musicals. We estimate that approximately 1200 people will attend the entire run of THE ODD COUPLE, including approximately 732 visitors from outside of Kansas City, Missouri. Based on analysis of 7,492 records in our Vendini database in June 2017, we know that 61% of past attendees came from outside of Kansas City, Missouri; and 3.7% came from states outside of Missouri and Kansas. We anticipate this trend to continue. Over the years, we have learned that each production at MET draws approximately 300 new patrons to the theatre on average. Many become return visitors or season ticket holders if they live close enough. Many others return a few times a season when in town on business travel, but come often enough that we have learned their faces. However, the vast majority of patrons come from Jackson County, Missouri and Johnson County, Kansas. We are continuing to see ongoing increases born of the initiative we put into motion in 2015-2016 to develop new audiences. We are particularly interested in growing our service to traditionally under served communities and are pleased to see increases in those areas this season. For instance, by season's end, we expect to have doubled our attendance from the Latinx community thanks to outreach associated with our production of ANNA IN THE TROPICS.","POINT (-94.586159 39.055705)","39.0556414 -94.5857322"

Although local television stations has never been a viable option for us budgetwise, we have found cable companies more affordable (e.g. Time Warner Cable). We plan on advertising in cable companies, serving our primary regional markets: Topeka, KS, Wichita, KS, Springfield, MO and Omaha, NE. In addition, we will be investing in more targeted social media in these areas. Additionally, for the Holiday Musical, The Coterie has preexisting production photos of Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer and will able to send photos to several magazines that cater to the travel market, which we cannot always do because of their very early deadlines, including Missouri Life, Midwest Living, Show Me Missouri, AAA, and Travel Host.",,"The Coterie's summer and holiday musicals have become a family destination for visiting families and tourists.

There could be no better draw for the holidays then Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer which so compliments the other festive and unique holiday venues in Kansas City. Goosebumps the Musical runs for 7 weeks in the summer, providing ample opportunities for visitors to attend from the middle of June to the first week in August.","The Coterie's annual season of plays, including the SummerHoliday Musical Series, are indicative of our efforts to open up lines of communication between races, genders and generations, to entertain, to take risks, and to assure that every child or young adult and their families have a place at The Coterie. The Coterie attracts over 78,000 individuals and families each year, due to its accessibility and proven history of providing highquality productions.  Both the 2018 projects, Goosebumps and Rudolph, have high namerecognition and will appeal to both regular theatregoers and first time attendees.  The Coterie has rotated in Rudolph as the Holiday musical every other year and it has become a tradition for many families to come see the Holiday Musical, dine at the Crown Center shops, visit Santa's Gingerbread Station or the Mayor's Christmas Tree, or stay overnight at one of the Crown Center Hotels.","The SummerHoliday Musical Series (holiday 2016 and summer 2017) brought 36,190 individuals to Crown Center neighborhood.

For eleven years we gathered thousands to celebrate the planet with art and GIANT puppets but in 2017 we needed a fresh vision and ""Illuminated Waters"" was conceived. We moved the event to Friday and Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend, expanded the pre-show activities and designed the show to include puppets on boats in the river of Brush Creek, actually diving into the waters and glowing in the dark. We wish to continue that expansion to draw more audience participants from the region with a visual art display prior to the giant puppet show and with an invited guest artist collaboration. Pre-show activities will also include interactive art projects, roaming puppets, music, environmental education partners and food trucks. This evening will culminate in a giant puppet show utilizing the amphitheater of Theis Park and the waters of Brush Creek. These puppets would then end the night with a puppet glow and other glowing entertainment such as lighted hula hoopers, glowing art sculptures and fire spinners. All activities and art at ""Illuminated Waters"" will reinforce the central theme of the need for clean water and how each of us as responsible citizens have an obligation to make our city a better place to live. This expansion of our annual giant puppet event into a full evening festival of activities will continue to draw more tourists from the region to a truly unique art event for our city. The public will have the opportunity to also help create puppets and activities for the event with us, through a series of open studios and workshops.

They help promote this event and guide us in other marketing opportunities.","StoneLion Puppet Theatre holds community planning meetings to garner input on what the community wants to see and how to best execute those ideas. The neighborhood organizations will be asked to join in those conversations. While we have not asked for a written letter of approval from the organizations, several neighbors were involved in the event last year and we anticipate their involvement this year. The only request the neighborhood near the park had from us as a whole, was to not allow any event parking on their streets immediately next to the park. We had volunteers at the street entrances to ensure that was the case alongside signs and barricades.","Visitors to our city will find this truly unique weekend event as an added bonus to Memorial Day activities. This free art event for the entire family will have interactive activities such as make and take puppets, outdoor games, earth-friendly food trucks all with a positive theme of helping the planet we live on. The giant puppet show and glow party afterward will showcase our city in way that cannot be found anywhere else in the Mid-West. StoneLion's sterling reputation and vast touring network will bring visitors not only from the metropolitan region but from outside the state to participate. As an example, this grant request is being written in Atlanta, GA where our artistic director yesterday signed up a family who plans on driving in to be a part of the event after seeing our performances at the Roswell, GA Cultural Art Center. By placing this event at Theis Park we bring activity to an artistically under-utilized amphitheater (as quoted by Heidi Downer, marketing director, KC Parks and Recreation) in the heart of downtown. This makes the event within easy walking distance to art museums, Plaza shopping and nature centers allowing tourists to add a rich full day of Kansas City to their family scrapbooks.","StoneLion Puppet Theatre has a twenty-five year history of producing engaging, entertaining and thought-provoking art experiences for the entire family. When we put on events, families from across the metro come. Illuminated Waters is often the only event though that they can actually be a part of. This project is offered free of charge in the heart of the city creating an inclusive event for all demographics; geographically, age and ethnically. StoneLion's outreach all year long emphasize this concept.  We have had two-year olds, eighty-year olds, kids in wheel chairs, kids with paras, foreign nationals and the most ethnically and gender diverse cast in one production in the city. No one is turned down. Everyone can get involved. This is a true COMMUNITY event in all its marvelous diversity. Illuminated Waters allows families to not only experience art but be a part of it and that brings out their extended families and friends to watch. The theme of environmental responsibility and clean water is a core issue to our city and the world. When we use giant puppets and interactive art we provide a vehicle to deliver the message in a non-threatening way that the audience can take ownership of. Glowing art is major trend world-wide and Illuminated Waters is a shining example of this in our city.","""Illuminated Waters"" presents, in a unique artistic method, the effect our actions have on the planet around us. The event will provide real world actions to take to make the planet, and the neighborhood, a cleaner place to live positively impacting the actual neighborhood the event is taking place in and the city as a whole.","StoneLion uses audience numbers and satisfaction to measure our success. This year we are planning on asking audience to wear a free wristband to gain an accurate number of participants. StoneLion will also conduct a volunteer led survey of the audience participants to gain feedback on the effectiveness of the program. StoneLion conducts round table meetings of key participants ( board, artists, volunteers and community) to receive feedback and constructive criticism after the event is held.","As this is a free outdoor event collecting exact data on participants is a challenge. We peruse the parking areas recording license plate locations. Volunteers roam the audience asking brief survey questions including demographic questions and there are locations for anonymous feedback which this year will include a request for city/state. StoneLion this year will also wristband audience to insure a correct count instead of a gridded audience count, since we are expanding activities outside of the giant puppet show.",,"39.0333106 -94.5775471"

The jazz community consists of musicians, venue owners and managers, patrons, sponsors, fans, and other members of the public we think of as ""future jazz fans"". Neighborhoods that are home to jazz venues benefit from increasing traffic and more broad recognition from marketing efforts. Past attendees at 2014, 2015, 2016 AND 2017 Charlie Parker Celebrations came not only from the greater Kansas City area but from other states and at least three foreign countries: Sweden, Denmark, and Japan.","We work with VISITKC, providing promotional materials and information that is passed along to out of town groups know to be visiting Kansas City during the Charlie Parker Celebration. Media News Release ATTACHED. It is our intent to arrange events in all six council districts, every year. So far, this has not been possible, since it requires cooperation and availability of privately owned and operated venues, which is outside our control. Numerous TV and radio spots are either paid for by us, or are offered by local TV & radio stations as public service promotions.  newspaper and magazine ads are purchased.  Social media and email marketing are used to pinpoint jazz and live music stakeholders and keep our message in front of them before and during the Celebration.",,"Jazz musicians and fans around the world are attracted to Kansas City generally and the Charlie Parker Celebration specifically because of his influence on the course of the genre: his musical reputation and contributions. Parker is known to jazz fans nationwide and worldwide. He grew up here, learned the saxophone here, developed much of his musical skills here, and is buried here. During the celebration his music is featured in 2025 live performances at 1215 live music venues over a 10day period. There is a student musician workshop, as well as other opportunities for musicians to learn about Charlie Parker's legacy as well as how to express it musically from our Artists in Residence. We offer a historical tour of Kansas City landmarks with ties to Charlie Parker's years as a resident here, plus a raucous musical birthday celebration at his grave site. In 2017 we added a Signature Concert at the Folly Theater that was attended by over 600 fans.  We estimate 200300 out of town visitors have participated in each year's celebration.","Live music venues featuring the music of Charlie Parker offer an opportunity to taste jazz music for those that are unfamiliar, yet curious enough to try something new. Featuring a variety of live jazz venues provides a guide for potential patrons to where they can always find live Kansas City jazz being performed. Parker's influence on musicians of all types creates a connection to Parker and a connection to Kansas City's unique jazz history that can be enjoyed just minutes away from every part of the metro area. Residents of neighboring communities within the city that choose to give the Charlie Parker Celebration a few hours of their time will realize how near they are to touching Kansas City's jazz history as well as its present and future, all while making a positive economic impact.","We ask leadership of neighborhood organizations to get the word out: to find ways to communicate what we are doing and encourage residents of all neighborhoods to participate by patronizing our featured venues and sampling our featured events including panel discussions, workshop, 21 Sax Salute, BRWCHC reception and party. We invite associations to participate via letters of support. We suggest how they might partner with us by providing guides and volunteers to distribute marketing materials, and provide a meeting place for the CPC Planning Committee. Making an economic impact on venues and neighborhoods is our ultimate goal of the CPC, demonstrating our organizations slogan, ""lifting the tide that raises all jazz boats"". Our event will promote the registered neighborhoods by raising awareness of historical ties between jazz musicians, performance venues and the neighborhood. Neighborhood businesses, churches and music venues have provided goods and services to generations of musicians, residents and live music patrons. Our event puts the spotlight on the live music helping to develop both a sense of pride in the area as well as an inviting atmosphere. In so doing we are inviting people seeking and receptive to different entertainment venues and to become acquainted with these neighborhoods which leads to growing positive economic impact on the area. The more thriving the neighborhood, the better quality of life for all.","The numbers, abovemedia appearance reach plus actual attendance / demographics of attendees at venues and events are critical. We are still learning what to do as far as maximizing reach and attendance is concerned The number of paid historical tour participants ($25 each, to cover cost of bus transport, drivers, and tour guide) is also important, since it is more easily measuredaccurately by ticket sales. We have seen participation grow from approximately 25 for the inaugural event in 2014 to 76 paid participants in 2017. Historical tour is very helpful for ""immersion"" of participants into the Kansas City jazz scene from years past, tying today with our rich history of notable performers and composers. We do not seek profit / surplus from the Charlie ParkerCelebration. We seek to create as many ""Advocates for Kansas City jazz"" and enthusiasts as we possibly can, and to multiply that, year after year.","NOTE: Spreading awareness of the Charlie Parker Celebration is not the ultimate goal for the event.  But it is the first step toward achieving our goals for the event. Through repetition producing this event year after year we are confident we can ultimately reach 2,000,000+ via social media, traditional media (radio, TV, print) and word of mouth with the message of Charlie Parker's importance and the celebration's events themselves. Our Media & Public Relations consultant, Don Pfannenstiel, estimates that via these outlets, the meaning and message regarding the Charlie Parker celebration 2017 reached over 1,000,000 viewers / listeners / readers.

A stage (along with professional lighting and sound systems) is set up, generally at the northernmost point of Roanoke Park, with seating available on a slope to the south which provides a natural amphitheater. The event is co-produced by City in Motion, a thirty-year-old not-for-profit dance school and production company with a mission to foster the development of high quality contemporary dance programming and expand the dance audience in the Kansas City metropolitan region. Patrons begin to arrive as early as 5:30 p.m. and are greeted and given programs by volunteers from surrounding neighborhoods. A ""blanket only"" area is roped off in front of the stage to provide seating for those who do not bring chairs. Most patrons bring folding chairs and sit on the hill behind the blanketarea. (Photos of the 2017 crowd are attached to this proposal.) At 6:30 pm, a half-hour class is provided for children (though many adults participate) in a particular form of dance. The 2017 class was Hawaiian; past classes have included East Indian,Hip-hop, Greek and Salsa. (photo of 2017 class attached) At 7 pm, a two act show, consisting of ten dance routines begins. These routines represent a variety of dance styles and cultures. The 2017 event included Contemporary, Ballet, Arial Arts, Oriental-style Belly Dancing, Capoeria, and Polynesian to provide a well-rounded experience for the audience. (photos are attached) Each year, different groups are invited to perform, creating a new experience for the audiences. In addition to the cross-cultural arts aspect of the event, Dance in the Park provides an opportunity for people from local neighborhoods, the greater Kansas City area, and the region to gather and get to know one another and to meet visitors from other geographic locations.

A VNA member sits on the committee for Dance in the Park and provides volunteer services including distribution of posters and signage for the event. Members of the VNA volunteer on the night of the event to assist as needed.","Many of those who attend who are visiting the city are friends or relatives of participating dancers while others are invited by friends who live in the area. Dance in the Park offers visitors an opportunity to experience the friendly ""hometown"" atmosphere for which we are known. Dance in the Park is unique in its cultural crossover nature in combining an artistic presentation experience with a home-town picnic atmosphere. For visitors to the city who are looking for free high-quality entertainment, there is nothing better. Those coming to Kansas City just for this event, will also be provided with the opportunity to enjoy regional dining experiences and the occasion to enjoy other related cultural offerings such as the Kauffman Center for Performing Arts and the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art.","Dance in the Park provides an opportunity for city residents to gather with friends and neighbors and enjoy home town talent in a beautiful midtown Kansas City setting. City in Motion, a Kansas City based not-for-profit organization, coordinates the event and invites a wide variety of trained dancers from the region to showcase diverse styles of dance. This high quality production attracts people from many socioeconomic backgrounds and from all age groups. Low to moderate income residents who might not otherwise be able to afford to see productions of this caliber appreciate the free admission. Production values combined with the casual family-friendly atmosphere of one of Kansas City's many parks create an atmosphere that appeals to just about anyone. Additionally, the majority of the performers are local residents adding to a sense of pride in the city itself.","Recognition of the contributions of the neighborhoods is included in the event program. Use of Roanoke Park is promoted by virtue of attendees becoming aware of the site and its amenities. Since the park is bordered directly by three of the five participating neighborhoods, this awareness draws attention to the neighborhoods themselves. The Volker Neighborhood (the group submitting this proposal) also places an information table at the back of the seating area. The table is staffed by neighborhood volunteers (often board members) and offers information about the neighborhood association. Mentions of the neighborhood are made by the emcee during the production.","The simplest and surest mark of success for this event is audience reaction. As mentioned earlier, 2018 will mark the 20th annual Dance in the Park. In September, 2017, approximately 1,400 people attended the event which lasted two and a half hours. At the end, very few people had left, and almost all of those who were observed leaving early had infants or small children. The applause and cheering was as strong, if not stronger, at the end of the show as it was at the beginning. Performers and volunteers reported many positive and no negative comments from audience members. The fact that the event has continued to draw a large crowd (many of whom have attended previously) for 19 years is indicative of its success. Unfortunately there is no physically measurable means of evaluation available due to the openness of the venue and the uncontrolled coming and going of attendees.","This year a tally of license plates in the parking area and street parking was completed. Approximately 30% of the license plates were from out of state. Most of those were from Kansas which is not surprising given the proximity of the event to State Line Road. Due to the open access to the event from all sides, it is virtually impossible to question attendees directly as to their state or city of residence. Also, as a number of the attendees are from surrounding neighborhoods and walk to the event, the projected number of non-Kansas City attendees has been adjusted lower than the actual percentage based on vehicle registration.","POINT (-94.601086 39.060933)","39.0609109 -94.601108"

We also will take advantage of platforms available through the Office of Culture and Creative Services, such as a presence on the digital screens along the KC Streetcar. We will place rack cards (promotional print registration materials) at available locations in areas of the city most likely to be visited by tourists: Downtown, the River Market, Crossroads, East Crossroads, Westport, and the Country Club Plaza.",,"In 2016, the Pilgrim Run drew participants from 24 different states, Washington D.C., and two Canadian provinces. Over a third of our participants are from outside Missouri or Kansas. Because our event falls on a holiday, many of our participants come as out-of-town guests visiting Kansas City to spend time with family, and we know from many participant surveys that this run is a fun, active way to spend time with those guests. We hear regularly from out-of-town registrants that they look forward to participating every year, which we believe provides a reason for families who have some members here in Kansas City, while others are spread out across the U.S., to choose Kansas City as their annual location for their Thanksgiving holiday.","While there are other Thanksgiving Day 5K races, the Pilgrim Run is the only race that takes place in the urban center of the city. Our course is easy to run, but more than that, it is a beautiful tribute to the historic architecture that built Kansas City. This helps us stand out from the other races on the same day, and because we have seen steady attendance if not growth in attendance every year, we believe that our race is uniquely positioned to establish itself as a Kansas City tradition. We will appeal to the broader Kansas City, Missouri community by branding ourselves as a healthy holiday family tradition that is fun, accessible, and enjoyable for all Kansas City residents, particularly those who, in recent years, have been drawn back to urban living in Kansas City.","The Pilgrim Run 5K fun run promotes the Hyde Park neighborhood in two main ways. For residents of the neighborhood, the run has become an annual volunteering and spectating tradition. Any time neighbors spend time working together or celebrating achievements together, it fosters a sense of belonging that directly supports the community. It gives them something in common besides geography. The Pilgrim Run 5K also attracts hundreds of non-residents to the neighborhood, allowing them to see that the midtown neighborhoods of Kansas City, Missouri are safe, thriving, family-friendly places to live where residents are proud of what they&#39;ve worked together to build. We also know of several instances in which Pilgrim Run participants were visiting the area for the first time, and fell in love with the historic homes so much that they ended up purchasing houses in the neighborhood. Also, many of our promotions refer to the run as the Hyde Park Pilgrim Run, so the branding itself helps draw positive attention to the neighborhood.","We measure success through participant satisfaction surveys, through the increase in number of participants/registrants, and through total net revenue to benefit Pilgrim Center&#39;s community programs. We track number of participants and revenue through our online registration platform, and we use SurveyMonkey for our post-race participant satisfaction survey.

With the relaxation of sexual mores, there is less sexual inhibition. This could possibly lead to sexual encounters with a person who is unknowingly a relative, resulting in a pregnancy that could lead to the birth of a child whose lineage may only be revealed through acknowledgement by persons with specific information or in some cases, DNA. With todays reliance on scientific technology to use DNA when there is a question about paternity, it is also possible that a kinship might be revealed. Shedding light on this unimaginable, but possible set of circumstances is the underlying premise for the film Next Of Kin.As a young man, every summer my family would visit my grandparents in a small town in the south. My brothers and I were maturing and like most teenagers becoming interested in the opposite sex. We were told by our elders in no uncertain terms who we could and could not date, since so many of the people in the small town were somehow our relatives. Remembering this piqued my curiosity about all the possibilities that exist, as people grow older and begin their lifes journey and move around geographically, encountering people without all of the information needed about someone they are attracted to in order to make an informed decision about involving themselves in a relationship. Through my contemplations a story began to form in my mind, resulting in the script for Next Of Kin.In terms of style, and approach, in making Next Of Kin, it is the story that dictates the style of the production, encompassing shot selection, composition, lighting, sound, locations, delivery of dialogue, and music score. Telling the story in a believable manner takes precedence over all technical aspects in the filmmaking process. Every shot, the quality of lighting in each scene, every sound, and every line of dialogue has to contribute to the storytelling experience.Stylistically, shot composition is generally often tight to intensify the emotions of the characters and to evoke a subtle emotional response in the viewer, engaging them in the story as it unfolds. Subsequent wide shots are intended to offer relief to the viewer allowing them time to gradually ascend to the next emotional peak.As a story about family, I want an overall feeling of warmth created by warm colors that are inherent to the locations, though sometimes contrasted with cool blue colors in certain scenes, i.e., flashbacks to distinguish them from the present. Telling the story is the guiding force in terms of production technique. The intent is essentially to trim everything in the filmmaking process to what is essential. Everything has a purpose in telling the story.","4","4","KC MeltingPot Theatre","3051 Central Street","64108",,"Cultural","N/A","350","75","One-Time Event","11500","0","0",,"The mission of the organization is to support film projects that promote African American culture, by providing programs and activities such as filmmaking workshops, screenings, and assistance to filmmaking projects.","Flyers & posters both physical and electronic distributed KC Metro Area and on the Metro Transit system.Seek newspaper feature articles in the Kansas City Globe, Kansas City Star and the Pitch Magazine. lInterviews for filmmaker Stinson McClendon on stations KKFI 90.1 FM, KCUR 89.3 FM, KPRS 107.3 FM, and KPRT 1590 AM.Screening of the NEXT OF KIN film October 6, 2018  at the KC MeltingPot Theater.Distribute electronic flyers and trailer to the Convention and Tourism industry in metropolitan area.Produce a 90 second TV Pubic Service Announcement",,"The patrons of the arts are always looking for events such as film events of this type to attend when they and their families when in our city.

Since 1981, A CHRISTMAS CAROL at KCRep has thrilled patrons young and old as they travel with Ebenezer Scrooge on his journey from bitter, lonely miser to warm-hearted, generous citizen of the world. Full of love, laughter, and lessons, this play feels both familiar and brightly new each year.In 2017, A CHRISTMAS CAROL at KCRep was quite literally brightly new! We staged a new adaptation penned by our own artistic director (and professional playwright), Eric Rosen, marking the first time weve offered a fresh take on the classic story. Rosens adaptation hews closely to its source material, placing Dickens written words back in the mouths of his beloved characters and reminding audiences how this timeless holiday tale was born. Once read live before audiences by the author himself, A CHRISTMAS CAROL, in Rosens hands, reclaims its origins as a story brought to life from the pages of a book.KCReps production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL features a cast of more than 60 local actors. Twenty-six adults and 38 children  all of whom make their homes in Kansas City  take the stage night after night to complete the winter traditions of families who travel to Spencer Theatre from Kansas City, its surrounding suburbs, and our citys neighboring regions. With a full week of extended performances in 2018, A CHRISTMAS CAROL will take to the stage for more than 40 public performances (not to mention 11 daytime student matinees)!In 2018, KCRep will welcome more than 20,000 patrons who have made our production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL part of their holiday traditions. An additional 5,500 kids from elementary, middle, and high schools across the metro will attend daytime matinees and participate in post-show Q&A sessions in which they get to ask their burning questions to member of our stage crew and our cast of professional actors. A CHRISTMAS CAROL plays an important role in every season of operations. Single ticket sales from this production exceed those for any other show, making Dickens story an important part of our annual budget. Like regional theatres nationwide, KCRep relies upon our annual staging of A CHRISTMAS CAROL to post a substantial surplus, creating a pool of funding that helps support the daring, adventurous works that fill our production calendar the rest of the year. KCRep thanks the committee for the Neighborhood Tourist Development Fund for their consideration of this request to support the marketing expenses associated with promoting A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

Our celebration (the first of its kind in the Greater Kansas City area) captures the vibrancy of the Latino culture in the lively art displays and the musical performances, while simultaneously offering a venue for community members to be a part of a cultural experience deeply rooted in tradition. Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) honors those who have passed on and celebrates their lives; this holiday is a time when families come together to remember the dead and appreciate the continuity of life.  The Mattie Rhodes Centers Dia de los Muertos celebration and exhibit lasts seven weeks.  The exhibit opens the first Friday in October, coordinating with the First Friday events in the Crossroads District.  In 2016, more than 2,000 community members and tourists viewed artwork inspired by Dia de los Muertos in the weekends opening celebrations.  A second reception is held the first Friday in November offering a mariachi performance, traditional foods and drink, as well as a parade that takes place outside around the neighborhood.The street festival includes booths from local artisans, shops, and food trucks in the street.  Dancers, musicians, and other entertainers perform on a stage outside.  Activities are provided for children such as carnival games, face painting, and inflatables.  As the popularity of the event continues to grow, so do our entertainment offerings. New in the past couple of years was an interactive puppet parade for children during both our street festival and our final first Friday gallery opening in November. KCs Stone Lion Puppet Theater provides the creative inspiration for the childrens parade, engaging children participating in the parade. During October and November workshops and classes are offered at the Art Gallery for school and other groups with people coming from miles away to visit. Each year 40-50 student groups come to the Mattie Rhodes Center for the Dia de los Muertos Workshops (groups range in size from 12 students to 60 students).  Some groups have been coming to the workshops since the events inaugural celebration 19 years ago.  Guided tours are offered for groups which includes a hands-on cultural arts activity.

The Gallery is in the Westside neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, about a half mile southwest of downtown Kansas City.  The Westside has the following (approximate) borders: 12th Street (north), 31st Street (south), Broadway (east), and State Line (west).  The Westside has a large concentration of Hispanic residents; nearly 50% of the neighborhood population identifies as Latino (U.S. Census Bureau). The Westsides geographical separation from the rest of Kansas City has created a very unique neighborhood with a real sense of identity and community. The recent attraction of downtown living in Kansas City, the birth and ongoing growth of the Crossroads Arts District and Power and Light District, and the close proximity to the newly developed Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts have made the Westside an extremely desirable and sought after neighborhood in which to live. Additionally, the development of UMKCs Conservatory of Music planned at 17th and Broadway will bring young musicians looking for opportunities to contribute in the community.","6000","3000","Annual","15000","5196","12000","180502","Mattie Rhodes Center enriches the lives of individuals, families and communities in a respectful, multicultural environment.

As the only Latino cultural arts organization in the bi-state (Missouri/Kansas) area, Mattie Rhodes Center does attract visitors who travel specifically to visit our Art Center and Gallery (this year we sold an art piece to an individual from Arizona who had come to see the Dia de los Muertos Exhibit). Often, fieldtrip groups from across and outside the metropolitan area (and from as far away as St. Louis) come to Mattie Rhodes Center to learn about the holiday, the Latino and Mexican cultures, and Latino cultural arts.  We are known as a cultural resource, especially for schools with limited budgets for cultural arts programming. For those who may have left Kansas City, the Dia de los Muertos celebration is a great time to come and reconnect with the city and the festival they have attended in years past.","Dia de los Muertos celebrates the colorful and loving history of Mexico. The event highlights things we all have in common: life and death, joy and sorrow. Its perhaps for this reason that this tradition with roots in Aztec times still resonates today, and that this Mexican custom draws participants from all backgrounds. The Mattie Rhodes Art Gallery is proud to play a part in this cultural tradition by creating a space where people of all ages can learn about its history and modern significance. Residents of Kansas City are attracted to this event mainly because it is the biggest and longest running Dia de los Muertos celebration in the Kansas City area. Its success has spawned partnerships with places like the Kansas City Museum and Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, who Mattie Rhodes Center coordinates with to hold yearly events as well. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Arts annual celebration is their most well-attended of the year with over 10,000 people coming, a reflection of the popularity of the holiday. Over the years, our celebration has developed a following of dedicated participants who come year after year for family friendly activities and exhibits. Newcomers hear about the quality artwork and instillations on display as well as the educational opportunity the event offers. Overall, the event provides a cultural connection not easily found elsewhere; people know they can come and experience a little piece of what they might see at a Dia de los Muertos celebration in Mexico.","The Dia de los Muertos art exhibit and street festival draw new visitors to the Westside neighborhood, showcasing the community identity and pride.  For example, many school groups from outside the city make a day-trip of the event.  Student groups will often eat lunch and get snacks and/or shop in the area.  Recently, one school group came to the Westside to tour our Art Gallery for Dia de los Muertos, and then went on to eat Lunch at La Fonda and to get ice cream at La Tropicana, therefore bringing their commercial business to the neighborhood as well. The activity showcases the Westside (home to Boulevard Brewing, the Roasterie, Southwest Boulevard, and many Authentic Mexican restaurants).  Residents and businesses gain exposure (throughout the 7-week period) and receive many visitors who might not normally visit the area.","The ultimate success of the event is determined by participation by residents and visitors of the Kansas City area as well as the number of artists that participate. Year after year, we have increased attendance rates- in the past year, we had 18 schools visit to view the exhibit and over 3000 people come during the First Fridays and parade. After each event, Mattie Rhodes Center pulls together the planning committee and participating artists to evaluate the program using a SWOT analysis- what went well, challenges experienced, and opportunities for the future. These meetings help the event grow and change each year.","Zip codes are collected by volunteers during each day of the event including Octobers First Friday, the Saturday parade, and Novembers First Friday.

This will be achieved by using the promotional tools selected above as well as through:- HEAR Now's e-Newsletter, THE NARRATOR- SAG/AFTRA's Member Newsletter- AudioFile Magazine and E-Newsletter- Unity Temple on the Plaza's Newsletter- National WWI Museum and Memorial Newsletter and website- Prospero's Books' website- Simpson House's Newsletter- The Society of Voice Arts and Sciences Performance and vendor hall booths- The Audio Engineering Society and vendor hall boothsIn 2017 Blue Storm Radio broadcast (100,000 listeners) the 3 Celebrating Mark Twain events at Prosper","Yes. The neighborhood organizations intend to have a role in organizing the HNF event. Country Club Plaza, Westport and other neighborhoods will use their websites and social media forums to help publicize the HNF events. District 4's Westport and Country Club Plaza areas with their venues and businesses will have a role in organizing and hosting activities and events. Some of these include: Holiday Inn Country Club Plaza; Simpson House; Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts; local cinemas, such as the Cinemark Palace at the Plaza Theater; the National World War I Museum and Memorial; independent radio stations, such as KKFI; public radio stations, such as KCUR; local community centers and churches, such as the Community Christian Church, All Souls Unitarian Universal Church, and the Unity Temple on the Plaza; Kansas City Public Library, Plaza Branch; local audio theater troupes; Country Club Plaza; UMKC; and Westport restaurants, such as Cafe Trio, Grand Street Cafe, McCoys Public House, to name a few; and local businesses such as Prospero's Books.","According to a 2017 Nielsen Entertainment report, 32 million people go to at least one U.S. festival a year, traveling 903 miles on average to be there.      HNF, recognizing how far attendees will travel, will attract persons who do not live in Kansas City, MO, but who are visiting for another reason and hear about the event because of our extensive PR outreach through the city at other events because, to further quote the Nielsen Entertainment report, HNF continues to zero in on what makes our event unique while also gaining the support of the local community. As HNF takes place annually in June, which is traditionally a time when many students are graduating, weddings occur, and national conferences take place, it gives HNF additional possible visiting audiences. Many parents and relatives from other locations will be visiting Kansas City to celebrate these events, as well as conference participants. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, HNF found veterans who were staying at the Holiday Inn Country Club Plaza for a reunion enjoyed the opportunity to spend a few hours at the National World War I Museum and Memorial attending a free event hosted by HNF. In 2017, Blue Storm Radio broadcast (about 100,000 listeners) the 3 Celebrating Mark Twain events at Prosperos-a listener called in from Arizona to say he enjoyed the show. Bonfire Radios podcast of AUDIO Tonight! at All Souls  (about 1.2 million listeners) brought new ears to binaural performance. The HNF 1917 podcast allows listeners to hear that show currently online (3,000 visitor per week): http://www.hearnowfestival.org/1917-at-wwi-museum.html","HNF attracts Kansas City residents through the various programs we host for seniors, youth, and audio fiction fans. This successful encouragement of other residents from Kansas City to come to our registered neighborhoods has led the Missouri Arts Council again to again support the overall Festival in 2017-2018. This includes working with the National Storytelling Network, and, with HNF's targeting audiences that include other Kansas City neighborhoods -- those interested in, and involved in producing the following audio fiction and arts in all aspects of the entertainment media: podcasting; audio drama and radio plays; audiobooks; story-telling;- audio, video and computer game sound design; virtual reality film and animation sound design; sound art; web-casting; those involved in new media audio trends; spoken word; digitial storytelling community;- and more.     HNFs marketing plan is over-seen by a professional publicist, who, working with area media specialists, helps to promote the Festival locally, as well as working through our membership in the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, and collaborations with local organizations such as: Paseo Academy of Fine and Performing Arts; local cinemas, such as the Cinemark; UMKC; museums, such as the National World War I Museum and Memorial; independent radio stations, such as KKFI; public radio stations like KCUR; local community centers and churches, such as the Community Christian Church; and the Unity Temple at the Plaza; and working with local audio theater troupes. Additionally, there will be posters and flyers placed around key Kansas City venues to attract tourists.     Media campaigns to support HNF local events will include: saturating area independent radio stations with PSAs, reaching out to UMKC audio communication faculty and students, and putting information on the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce blog along with meeting the Visit KC initiatives. As in other years, we intend to have SiriusXM Radio broadcast from the Festival, which reaches tens of thousands of Kansas City, MO subscribers.","HNF will promote the registered neighborhood groups through the following ways: All press done for the HNF promotes the different registered groups, and their neighborhoods, by including all venues and their addresses, within these neighborhoods, on posters, in press releases, in community listing, and more. Guest artists interviewed on local radio or TV stations and in the press are also asked to be sure to include the names of venues and addresses.     Also, HNFs publicist will use social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) to promote the registered neighborhood groups; HNF will mount posters and put out flyers in the targeted venues and businesses; HNF will use local radio stations to advertise the Festival events; and, in addition, many of the venues hosting Festival activities and events have newsletters, either as Email blasts or on their websites. HNF will have listings in The Pitch and other local newspapers or bulletins.      In 2017, HNF put up over 75 posters and flyers throughout the Country Club and Westport neighbors, as these neighborhoods were the primary Festival locations, and HNF will do the same for the 2018 Festival. Also, HNF's contracted venues have offered to let the Festival announce their activities in their newsletters or on their websites.     In 2015, HNF established a volunteer and service learner program. In 2018, local area volunteers and high school and college student service learners will provide support in the areas of marketing, promotions, and management of celebrity guest's local travel needs. A total of 35 volunteers and service learners make it possible to take celebrities to local press interviews, where they promote the Festival. Volunteers and service learners help with set-up and take-down of events, such as networking parties, special programs and workshops. In addition, these volunteers and service learners help with local outreach programs to neighborhoods in Districts 3 and 4, other Kansas City audiences and tourists.     In addition, through the state and national organizations we are working with like, the Missouri Arts Council, the Audio Engineering Society, the Society of Voice Arts, SiriusXM Radio, and SAG-AFTRA, HNF will be able to further promote the registered neighborhood groups through these organization's extensive outreach programs on our behalf.","In the surveys, questions are crafted in direct response to each year's unique programs, guests and venues.

From 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, visitors of diverse interests and varied demographics stroll through numerous galleries, artists' studios and nonprofit arts organizations as well as a wide variety of restaurants and businesses to enjoy a vast array of creative work by local, regional, national and even international artists. Encouraged to explore the district by foot, guided by the Crossroads Map or the mobile friendly Crossroads website, which each month spotlights and pinpoints a large majority of First Friday events, visitors often come early and stay late savoring dinner or beverages in one of the many locally owned restaurants, cafes, craft breweries or coffee houses in the neighborhood or selecting items from one of the many food trucks set up in surrounding lots or along the streets. The First Friday tradition has continued to grow, even stimulating similar activities and events in adjoining communities and at businesses all along the streetcar route. The streetcar has noted a significant bump in ridership during every First Friday event (Please reference the attached KC Streetcar Authority Letter of Support and monthly ridership charts)! Monthly estimates of attendance at First Friday range between several thousand to over 12,000, depending on the weather and scheduled activities.","4","4","Crossroads Arts District","2000 Main","64108","First Friday in the Crossroads Arts District involves the entire community! To enjoy just a taste of all the event offers to visitors, one need only travel east on Southwest Blvd from Broadway to Wyandotte, popping into a wide array of galleries, restaurants and shops along the way. When reaching Wyandotte, head north, then turn right onto 18th Street to be greeted by artist vendor tables, open artist studios at The Bauer or a curated exhibit at Todd Weiner Gallery. Then stop into the street's many eclectic shops including Birdies, Peggy Noland, or an alleyway store and grab a bite at the iconic YJ's before continuing east toward Campbell to visit Studios Inc which provides studio space, professional development, networking, and exhibitions for mid-career artists. Along the way, experience one of the growing number of craft distilleries making national headlines.  Or one can turn west on 18th + Wyandotte to hear a performance by KC Youth Symphony, one of the many Crossroads nonprofits arts organizations performing throughout the year, take in 18Broadway Community Garden which supplies fresh food for Harvesters, then head north to the Kauffman Center for a special performance or just to take in the incredible view.  Those who keep traveling east along SW Blvd as it turns into 19th Street can pop into Blue Gallery, Weinberger Fine Art and then stop at the Crossroads Truck stationed every First Friday in front of ArtsKC at Baltimore + 19th to pick up a detailed Crossroads Map and learn more about specific galleries, events or the ever popular Food Trucks. Don't stop yet! Visitors can either keep heading east on 19th and hop onto the KC Streetcar line for a visit around the city or head south along Baltimore stopping into one of the pioneer galleries of the Crossroads Arts District including Sherry Leedy Contemporary Art, Leedy-Voulkos Art Center and owner/artist studios Archival Design and Studio Above.  From Broadway to Campbell, from 15th to 22nd Street, the entire Crossroads comes alive on First Friday! On one night every month of the year, one can visit established galleries, enjoy performance art events, shop for unique treasures by artist street vendors, grab a bite from a wide selection of Food Trucks or one of the locally owned food and drink establishments, and then hunt down any number of the ever increasing artistic murals throughout the community.  All are welcome!","Cultural","The Crossroads Arts District.","120000","100000","Series Of Events","34910","18532","18532","180272","The mission of the Crossroads Community Association is to support, promote, advance and encourage the continued revitalization of the Crossroads Arts District community as a thriving, safe and attractive center of art, culture, history, enterprise, commerce, residence, entertainment, education and tourism; to inform and educate the members of this association and the public at large about community issues; to provide a forum to address community objectives and issues; to build a strong community through communication, cooperation, planning and leadership; to build a strong partnership between artists, arts organizations, business owners, property owners, tenants and residents to ensure community involvement; and to enhance the quality of life within the community specifically and the city at large.","Promotion of First Friday is accomplished through both digital and hard copy means and by advancement through the local hospitality and tourism industry. Digital resources include the Crossroads website with both a general First Friday informational page and a month specific First Friday event page. CCA's social media platforms also play a robust role in promoting First Friday with an exceptionally extensive reach of 41,500 Twitter, 5,099 Facebook, and 22,100 lnstagram followers [#FirstFriday]. Numerous artists and arts organizations customize their digital promotion and publicity efforts by utilizing and forwarding CCA website and social media sources and information. In addition, digital promotion of First Friday is enhanced by VisitKCs monthly website coverage. The combination of these various digital resources creates a powerful promotional and educational tool for the advancement of the event. The most effective and efficient hard copy resource utilized is the Crossroads Map. The map is distributed far and wide as numerous requests are serviced throughout the year. Over 10,000 maps alone are furnished to MDT and KDT Visitor Centers, in addition to regional universities, visiting conventions and VisitKC for their events and promotions. Maps are also supplied through the Kansas City Area Development Council (KCADC) and various regional businesses including Cerner, Hallmark, Burns + McDonnell to use as a recruiting and/or new employee resource. Maps are additionally requested from and supplied to numerous hotels and out of town requests throughout the region as well as Union Station, the American Jazz Museum, the Plaza Visitor Center and diverse businesses throughout Downtown, Midtown and the Westside for hosted events and as an a employee resource. Maps also are also made available every First Friday at the Crossroads Truck for an expansive and demographically diverse audience. While digital and hard copy promotional resources are essential, advancement through the local hospitality industry is also highly effective. When CCA distributes maps, many hotel front line staff are familiarized with First Friday and invited and encouraged to attend one of the events in order to better inform their clientele about gallery and studio particulars, including specific areas of arts interest.","The CCA's role in First Friday is to advocate and promote First Friday through various means of advertising and outreach and to provide a creative, culturally diverse, fun, safe, family-friendly experience for visitors once they arrive.  The CCA would also like to provide and coordinate more extensive public amenities and security for those who attend First Friday each month. With the events growing popularity, providing adequate amenities is essential. While the crowd size may fluctuate each month, the demand for these services does not. With the appreciated ability to test these services during past NTDF cycles, the CCA found the response overwhelming! Facility providers did an extraordinary job, event attendees were highly positive, and gallery owners and nonprofit arts organizations were thrilled to have convenient, needed resources for patrons. In addition to public amenities, the ability to provide a small security presence of approximately six off duty officers during the adjustable hours of 8PM to 11PM is another highly desired goal.  With the ability to furnish security and much needed public amenities for this monthly, free event, the CCA will be able to provide an increasingly positive experience, ensuring repeated future visits by residents and tourists in the months ahead. In addition to providing public amenities to visitors. In addition, the CCA's efforts toward promoting First Friday will continue to be accomplished through past proven means such as the Crossroads Map, website, social media sites and community outreach via the Crossroads Truck. The Crossroads Map (hard copy + digital) is an invaluable tool for all visitors as it assists them in navigating the community and providing information on galleries, studios and arts organizations taking part in the event. The website consists of an extensive section exclusively devoted to First Friday. ""About First Friday"" provides requested general information including what a visitor might expect, how to exhibit or perform, where to park within the Crossroads, and digital, downloadable Crossroads and Parking maps. The ""This First Friday"" section contains current exhibits along with a mobile-friendly pin map. For many artists, galleries and nonprofits, the website has become the primary vehicle by which they are able to reach a wider audience with greater, more up-to-date content. The website also provides promotion of First Friday events hosted by surrounding communities including Downtown, Midtown, Westside, Crown Center, West Bottoms and the 18th + Vine Jazz District's own First Friday celebration when requested. Finally, the Crossroads Truck enables the CCA to reach out to various local community events in an engaging, creative way, generating familiarity and a level of comfort about the event for local residents throughout the metro.","Through continued event promotion and ensuring a good experience once visitors arrive, First Friday in the Crossroads Arts District will continue to expand its regional and national reputation. The event has received press in travel and airline magazines along with various industry journals and many cities throughout the nation have contacted the CCA regarding the event and the principles used in its success. In light of the excitement about First Friday, many national arts organizations have chosen to hold conferences and events around the monthly celebration including the upcoming 2017 International Sculptural Conference. Also, organizations and businesses have been known to specifically schedule meetings in order to overlap with a First Friday event so that either during or after programming, attendees are able to venture into the streets to enjoy a truly unique Kansas City celebration of the arts. As Mo Dickens of the Belger Arts Center stated, ""We continue to have visitors from around the nation and around the world, several of them were carrying Crossroads maps. While I point them to additional areas of artistic interest in the city, it is the Crossroads Arts District in general and First Friday in particular they want to experience."" In speaking with hotel staff and visitor centers, we find them extremely enthusiastic about providing guests with information about First Friday. The hospitality industry's goal is to showcase the best of Kansas City to their clientele and First Friday has become one of the city's highlights. The Crossroads Map provides a ready resource to help navigate the event and the up to date event information hosted on the mobile friendly website, including direct links to artists, galleries and nonprofit arts organizations who call the Crossroads Arts District home, supplies additional valued information for those not familiar with our community. Among all the wonderful sights, sounds, tastes and experiences our city has to offer, the success of Crossroads Arts District as a centrally located, vibrant, creative, cultural community and First Friday as a monthly, freely available premier arts event continues to play a part in the ascendancy of Kansas City as a top tourist destination. The CCA believes that the increasing number of individuals it is able draw to First Friday in Crossroads Arts District as well as surrounding communities, the more financial resources and goodwill the community and city as a whole will gain on the national level.","Excitement about First Friday, created in large part through the generous funding of NTDF, has proven to be instrumental in the event's attraction for KC area residents. American urbanist, William H. Whyte asserted that crowded, pedestrian friendly, active spaces are safer, more economically productive, and more conducive to healthy civic communities. What attracts people most, it would appear, is other people. Through promotional materials that highlight First Friday's demographic diversity, we aim to convey a warm welcome to ALL who would like to attend this free event and discover some new artistic treasure. We are succeeding! Walk the streets of any First Friday celebration and you will discover an eclectic, largely local arts community being enjoyed by a wide array of demographics. Individuals coming together simply to enjoy the arts in each other's company. There is something for everyone and everyone is welcome! First Friday has become Kansas City's monthly art fair and block party for those who live in Kansas City and its environs, one that provides a wealth of exposure to and education about the arts through numerous galleries and artist studios, various arts organizations and by interactions with street vendors and performers. All visitors are assured an enjoyable time of informative, arts enrichment in a family-friendly and celebratory environment. This year was particularly delightful as the Missouri Humanities Council held a literacy hunt for children. Crossroads businesses and nonprofits enthusiastically took part, hosting activities at each location, stamping the children's ""passport"" upon activity completion and providing treats along the way. At the end, the children were greeted by Mayor Sly James who passed out books and held a reading session. In addition, our continued outreach through the Crossroads Truck to various local community events throughout the year advances familiarity and a level of comfort about the event to area wide residents. We have been able to answer questions, provide the Crossroads Map and gallery/event information, and build an ongoing rapport with those we hope will attend in the future. Through funding for greater public amenities and security, in addition to promotional material, the CCA believes it will be able to provide and ensure an ever more positive and convenient event for visitors who attend one or all First Friday events.","First Friday continues to shine the spotlight on Kansas City's exceptional arts community and the place many artists call home, the Crossroads Arts District. While both the community and city benefit culturally and economically from the monthly event, the welfare of the artist and the arts industry remains the primary goal of the CCA's efforts. As noted in a recent study by ArtsKC, while the nonprofit arts and the culture industry creates a substantial economic impact, the organizations and artists they serve continue to exist at the economic margins. While the annual economic impact of independent artists, writers and performers in the metro area is significant, with gross receipts in 2014 of $68 million, the per capita revenue figures for individual artists showed an average income of less than $15,000 in 2014, illuminating the economic challenge artists face in light of rising taxes, rental expenses and artistic material costs. For a great many artists in and around the Crossroads and for those who come to First Friday to participate as street vendors free of charge, the success of this monthly event continues to be a financial boon for them, one that in many cases keeps local artists afloat for the remainder of the month. Through the years, Mayor Sly James has repeatedly stressed the essential need and economic benefit of promoting KC's arts community. The CCA greatly appreciates and applauds the city's advocacy and prioritization of the arts and will continually strive to promote this monthly arts event which includes visual, music, film, performance and a host of other arts activities showcasing the creative potential in this city. First Friday maximizes Kansas City's talent and resources each month, putting them on display, providing a venue for artists to collaborate, bringing regional and national attention to the city and producing revenue related to the arts. As the CCA continues to promote and support an environment in which the arts community is able to survive and thrive by the continued success of this artistically enriching, demographically diverse, family-friendly event, we are able to create and sustain a stronger, more economically viable and socially cohesive community for artists, local residents and out of town visitors year round. And as First Friday in the Crossroads Arts District continues to grow and flourish, the CCA is thrilled by the reported cultural and economic impact made to surrounding communities as well, ever enhancing the city's local and national draw.","Each year the CCA tries to be both realistic and ambitious in creating a successful event. To that end, the organization continually strives to increase First Fridays crowd size, provide a positive experience to visitors once they arrive, and boost the events profitability for artists who attend. First, the CCA asks whether attendance at First Friday per each respective month has grown. Event growth is a solid indicator of success in reaching critical mass through both digital, which includes our website and social media, and traditional, hard copy promotional means. As the CCA works to be both efficient and effective in fund allocation, digital means will increasingly offer the CCA greater affordability, extensive social reach, enhanced ability to provide timely information and opportunity to monitor interest through the established event hashtag, #First Friday. The CCAs goal is to have First Friday acquire new attendees simply by virtue of our visitors' networks so that more funds may be allocated to needed public amenities and security needs. Secondly, the CCA determines First Fridays success through its continued affordability measured by the traditional equation of, Total Ad Spend / # of Actual Attendees = Cost Per Acquisition. In the past four years, the cost of First Friday has always run under a dollar per person, and in fact, it has decreased every year during that time frame. However, the most meaningful measure of First Fridays success is the feedback received from Kansas City's exceptional, diverse arts community. The progress of countless individual artists and nonprofit arts organizations, measured not only in economic terms but in professional visibility, viability and vitality gained from the evening's festivities, will continue to be the most appreciated measure of success for the CCA. The Crossroads unique, eclectic arts collective was the organic catalyst from which First Friday in the Crossroads Arts District initially arose and will continue to be the CCA's motivation for providing successful, demographically diverse, free, family-friendly First Friday events in the future.","The CCA continually strives to do our best to determine audience demographics each First Friday event. To date the CCA utilizes observational and random sample studies from the Crossroads Truck team and from participating CCA Board and Committee members attending the event along with input provided by galleries, arts organizations, restaurants and businesses. The Crossroads Truck team truly plays an invaluable role as they are at the 'epicenter' of the event with a view to the thousands of 'passersby' and those who stop to make inquiries. Reports are discussed each monthly Board meeting with pictures provided, if available. In addition, several traditional means of measuring First Friday audience demographics are used including crowd estimates determined by KCPD appraisals, approximated counts from area hotel concierges in connection to First Friday event inquiries and/or map requests, and attendance confirmations from social media and personal event invites. The CCA has also explored utilizing drone images provided by KC Drone. While demographics are somewhat more difficult to define with this method, it still provides the CCA with valuable information as to crowd size. Finally, though not event specific, both VisitKCs Visitor Profile + Economic Impact Research and visitor data provided by the Economic Development Council are valuable in fleshing out demographics of visitors to the Crossroads Arts District as a whole.","POINT (-94.583732 39.088753)","39.0889485 -94.5838848"

Working in collaboration with The Bridge radio station, and KC-based International Folk Alliance, the Folly will add to its performance profile an eclectic and inspiring set of concerts, rooted in American music as interpreted by the grand masters of folk, blues, rhythm, and country. Adding depth to the Series will be contemporary and &#34;rising star&#34; performers who have found American &#34;roots music&#34; to be a fulfilling genre to explore and interpret. The Americana Series will explore varied musical genres, with the point of continuity being the creativity of music developed by the American artist. While other venues present an occasional artist or concert with American music roots, our Series will take the patron on a journey that brings our country&#39;s musical past into focus, and deepens the understanding of music with traditional roots. We want to attract a regional,  intergenerational audience interested in learning about musical forms new to them, and to be exposed to a range of cultural traditions. Artist contracts are being formalized at this time. These artists are anticipated on the 2018-19 Series:  SteelDrivers, a Grammy Award-winning band, with a unique bluegrass sound; Richard Thompson, the astonishing guitarist/songwriter whose career has placed him on Rolling Stone&#39;s &#34;Top 100 Guitarists of All Time&#34;, and has seen him earn a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Americana Music Association of Nashville; Sarah Jarosz, the incredible vocalist who earned two Grammy&#39;s in 2017, Best Folk Album and Best American Roots Performance.","4","4","Folly Theater","300 W. 12th Street","64105","N/A","Cultural","The Downtown Neighborhood-KCMO Association is our registered partner, serving the area where the Folly Theater is located at 12h and Central Streets.","3000","1800","Series Of Events","73550","27581","27581","180736","To preserve Kansas City&#39;s oldest historic theater as a premier performance venue, we commit to maintain our building&#39;s heritage, diversify our program and entertainment offerings, and be an enthusiastic participant in the continuing revitalizations of Downtown Kansas City.","Strong relationships with VisitKC, the Downtown Council, KC Chamber, Hispanic and Gay & Lesbian Chambers, ArtsKC, Downtown hotels and a variety of media outlets, including our media partner, The Bridge radio station, give the Folly a platform for promoting this new performance Series to a wide audience of visitors to Kansas City, or friends/relatives of our citizens. As artists are contracted and marketing plans developed, our goals are to inform a broad cross-section of potential concert-goers in the four-state region. Any new cultural programming requires aggressive messaging through multiple information &#34;outlets&#34; or platforms, such as Google and Facebook ads, social media campaigns, print and public advertising, all working together to reinforce messages. A strong word-of-mouth &#34;buzz&#34; should further enhance interest in the concerts and Series. VisitKC, area hotels, and the Chambers mentioned above, are effective outlets to inform out-of-town business and pleasure travelers of upcoming events in Kansas City, like the concerts on the Americana Series. Our radio partner-promoter will be of assistance to reach more listeners than we might reach only via print, internet and other mediums. The station is popular for local listeners and visitors alike, which we predict will spread the interest in the Series and draw patrons to the  city, and to the Folly.",,"Intimate concerts, whether with a folk/rock/blues/or rhythm artist, create a different experience and memory for an audience member. Describing a Folly concert in these terms, in tandem with the reputation of the artists on the Series, should create interest in seeing the artist in a more private setting as opposed to an &#34;arena show&#34;.  The resulting difference in artistic flair and energy should make for an extraordinary concert experience. We predict the same outcome for the Americana Series, and will be using audience comments from one show to help generate interest in the next show. The Folly has experience through its 35-year old Jazz Series in marketing effectively to the four-state region. We will use this expertise and range of professional contacts to generate interest in these shows. Also, working in collaboration with the Downtown hotels and select businesses, we can appeal to the visitor who wishes to experience more of our city and cultural offerings.","The historic Folly Theater is a well-known and popular venue for concerts in Kansas City. Its intimacy and superb acoustics create a unique and engaging concert venue in an historic and ornate setting. The Folly strives to attract diverse audiences through its programming, and by creating engaging cultural experiences with exceptional value. From this base of connection with a diverse cross-section of local residents, we plan to connect to many who generously support the Theater, and will be intrigued by a different type/style of music and varied artistic influences and backgrounds. The artists will be at the top of their field, and should bring extraordinary musicality and entertainment to each concert. All those in Kansas City who seek high-quality cultural experiences from diverse artists should find the Series a match for their interests. We will program strategically to broaden and deepen the musical experience of our local and regional audience.","As civic progress and a resurgence of interest in living Downtown has come to fruition, the Folly stands proudly in the center of the Downtown cultural crossroads. All concerts on our new Americana Series offer more compelling reasons to focus on the amenities and diverse entertainment options in our Downtown neighborhoods. The Folly&#39;s reputation and location, within easy walking distance of hotels, restaurants and bars, make it a great draw for patrons both in and out of town. At the Folly Theater, both audience and artists alike are in the perfect location to access and enjoy all that the vibrant Downtown area has to offer. We anticipate 600-1,000 people in attendance at each concert on the Americana Series who will park, find refreshments/dinner, and enjoy the intimacy and historic nature of Kansas City&#39;s only remaining 19th Century theater, in the heart of Downtown&#39;s neighborhoods.","Ticket sales, attendance, and financial results are quantifiable, objective measures of success.  However, the Folly Theater board and staff are constantly gathering information about audiences and programming in order to make appropriate artistic and event decisions, and to maximize outcomes. We use feedback from ticket buyers, as collected by our box office staff, and the range of professional event reviews (in print and on-line professional commentaries) to assess a concert&#39;s artistic success. The success of ticket sales, and responses to invitations to join the event as a sponsor, help us gauge the public&#39;s response to our event, as well as affirm its purpose and overall quality.","Audience demographics will be collected mainly through box office records (zip codes, questions about how the customer chose to attend the event, etc.). In addition, non-scientific audience surveys go out after each Folly event to the ticket buyer, and seek input on the customer&#39;s satisfaction with the quality of the event, the location/parking, and other individual experiences. We rely on the goodwill of patrons to complete these surveys for the sake of improving the concert experience, and to assist the Folly staff in gaining a greater understanding of any issues or problems related to attending the concert. These surveys also ask the recipient to voluntarily provide demographic information concerning their age range and race. In addition, our volunteer usher staff is attentive to the needs of every patron, and is particularly trained to assist with those who have physical disabilities or challenges. These volunteers help gather data on attendees with special needs, and offer information opinion on audience demographics.","POINT (-94.587121 39.100075)","39.1003676 -94.587191"

Forks & Corks primary function is an evening of socializing while sampling fine food, wine, beer, and spirits from local restaurateurs, vintners, distillers, chefs, and more. 2019 marks the 23rd year this unique evening featuring, music, dancing, and gourmet food and drinks from over 50 of Kansas City&#39;s finest restaurants and beverage purveyors has assisted Harvesters in raising the increasing funds necessary to serve our community, move our mission forward, and expand our impact on the health of our community.  The secondary function of this event is educating our guests regarding food insecurity. This year, Harvesters plans to increase our focus on calls to action and advocacy by parking both the Harvesters&#39; Mobile Food Pantry bus and a Harvesters&#39; Box Truck just outside the stadium. Guests will have the opportunity to learn what Mobile Food Pantries are and their impact on the community, see how Harvesters transports food around the region, engage in advocacy activities inside the back of the box truck itself, and discover ways they can become involved through giving time, food, money, and voice to the issue of food insecurity. To encourage attendees to fully engage in the advocacy portion of the evening, we&#39;ll offer each guest a passport to be stamped at stations around the event designed to educate them about Harvesters and our mission.

Our mission is to feed hungry people today and work to end hunger tomorrow. As the region&#39;s only food bank, Harvesters&#39; expertise in distributing food and household products through our network of more than 480 schools and 620 nonprofit agencies is essential to communities across northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. In partnership with our network of emergency food pantries, community kitchens, shelters, day cares, and senior centers, we offer more than 1,200 programs for food-insecure children, families, and seniors across 26 counties. Harvesters envisions a time when everyone in our community will have access to enough nutritious food to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We work toward long-term solutions, building a stronger, healthier community through food access, nutrition services, hunger awareness, and advocacy.","Kansas City is home to a robust philanthropic community, and Harvesters Forks & Corks event has been part of that communitys landscape for 22 years. Forks & Corks is Harvesters most popular fundraising event, and each year, our donors and supporters from all over the community look forward to the evening. Working with the Neighborhood Tourism Development Fund has a particularly positive impact on our ability to grow a healthier community together while expanding the visibility of Kansas Citys vibrancy. Marketing to the entire Greater Kansas City area will occur through neighborhood billboards, posters, streetcar kiosks, flyers, quarterly mailed newsletters, and social media. Marketing this event to the businesses and residents in the wide mix of neighborhoods in Kansas City will begin in early 2019. Harvesters will continue to post updates on social media regarding the various restaurants, beverage purveyors, and entertainers that will be at Forks & Corks. This year, Harvesters plans to expand our marketing reach to more publications in the Kansas City Metropolitan area (Independence, MO; Lenexa, KS; etc). Additionally, we plan to expand our marketing reach in the Topeka community, the location of Harvesters second warehouse, in order to invite guests to make a night or weekend of visiting Kansas City. One way we plan to promote to the Topeka market is through offering ticket packages that include a community bus ride to and from Topeka on the night of the event. Harvesters staff, including the Special Events Manager, Communications Manager, and Volunteer Services Manager, will develop marketing efforts with the Planning Committee. The Planning Committee consists of a diverse group of Harvesters staff, Board Members, and community supporters from throughout our service area. This array of talent and community engagement permits each person to promote Forks & Corks within their own neighborhoods, churches, workplaces, and family and friend networks, while strategizing mechanisms to market to the Greater Kansas City area. The Planning Committee will also drive the momentum to gain new sponsors, restaurants, volunteers, and attendees from throughout the bi-state area.",,"Foodie festivals are a booming business in the for-profit sector. Forks & Corks will be highly appealing to the foodie population by highlighting some of the best food, drink, and entertainment Kansas City has to offer all in one place, with the added incentive of supporting a nonprofit dedicated to ending food insecurity, an issue that does not discriminate based on location. Additionally, many people enjoy the opportunity to visit professional sports venues when traveling, and Forks & Corks affords guests a unique opportunity to visit Arrowhead Stadium, famous for holding the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar. Harvesters will advertise Forks & Corks on VisitKC to attract visitors from out of the region, as well as promoting the event through radio, newspaper, and television advertisements.","Forks & Corks will appeal to Kansas City residents by providing an insiders look into Arrowhead Stadiumincluding places some might otherwise never get to see. With a Forks & Corks ticket purchase, attendees will get to experience various spaces that many tourists and fans have never been able to view. Usually, guests on game day can access their seats and explore only certain levels of the stadium. A Forks & Corks ticket, however, will allow guests to explore the Founders Club, Foolish Club, North Club, and more while offering a unique, one-of-a-kind view of the football field. Forks & Corks also appeals to local foodies by providing the opportunity to try food and libations from multiple local gems all in one place. Harvesters takes pride in bringing local flavors as well as national chains for hundreds of people to enjoy for one momentous evening. Exposure of the local flavors is key to the Planning Committee, which has brought numerous cornerstones of Kansas City to participate in Forks & Corks for several years. For example, Andres Confiserie Suisse is not only a long-standing staple in the Kansas City restaurant scene, but theyve been a committed partner for Harvesters Forks & Corks event for the past 22 years.  Finally, Forks & Corks will appeal to Kansas City residents interested in supporting a local nonprofit in a gala setting. Harvesters has been a part of the Kansas City community for the past 39 years, yet many people are still unaware of the magnitude of the issue of food insecurity in our community. Although it is often a hidden problem, odds are good you know someone who is hungry. He is a parent, skipping a meal so his child can eat. She is a senior, making the difficult decision between filling a prescription or buying groceries. And sadly, they are children, missing out on the nutrition they need to grow up healthy and strong. They are our neighbors and co-workers, our childrens classmates, and perhaps even members of our own family. Along with the social aspect of the evening, Forks & Corks will provide the opportunity for Kansas City residents to learn about food insecurity in our community, as well as educate them on ways they can make a difference.","Much like other major events held at Arrowhead Stadium, Forks & Corks will provide an economic boost among the businesses in the surrounding neighborhoods. Harvesters will note nearby lodging facilities through our website and Facebook event page related to Forks & Corks.","Beyond the total amount of money raised, Harvesters measures the success of Forks & Corks through tracking ticket sales, number of attendees, and the number of food and beverage vendors collaborating with us for the evening. By evaluating the events effectiveness in this way, Harvesters has successfully grown the event each year since it began in 1997 at the American Royal Grand Hall. Since that time, the location has changed to accommodate the yearly increase in vendors and guests, moving to Union Station in 2000, the Kansas City Convention Centers Grand Ballroom in 2007, and most recently to Arrowhead Stadium in 2018. Following our first ever sold-out Forks & Corks, we plan to expand into more areas of Arrowhead to accommodate an even larger number of guests and more strategical placement of vendors to lessen line wait times and overall crowd congestion.  Further, an evaluation meeting among Harvesters Fund Development staff is held within a week following the event to discuss number of tickets sold, amount of sponsorships, number of packages sold prior to and the day of the event, and the amount of money raised through texts, credit card swipe machines (DipJars), and raffles. Harvesters goal is to raise approximately $300,000 at Forks & Corks 2019. Fund Development Team reports gathered from the day of the event will be shared during the evaluation meeting. Staff then combines anecdotal information and reports to produce a review meeting for the Planning Committee.","Harvesters collects audience data through online ticket sales prior to the event, scanned tickets the evening of the event, and follow-up surveys after the event. We sell tickets through Eventbrite, allowing us to gather a large amount of data through online sales. Upon arrival at the event, we scan guests tickets enabling us to determine the number of guests who attended in relation to those who registered online. Additionally, we will send a post-event survey through Survey Monkey to garner feedback, opinions, and suggestions regarding the event, which will enable us to gather additional guest information as well.","POINT (-94.49361 39.051361)","39.0483972 -94.4843217"

Food, fun, and prizes are easily understood benefits and the Santa Theme is a popular draw.  ArtsTech events have a regional appeal and gives KCMO residents good reasons to attend.  Families with young children are always looking for fun family-friendly events during the late fall which are holiday themed.  This event provides Santa gifts to children, breakfast, activities, shopping, and holiday photos in one venue.  This makes it a fun, inexpensive outing.","Visiting families and art patrons look for a Saturday event that appeals to their children.

Families are often looking for fun, inexpensive events for their children.  Children can eat, get a picture with Santa, and each child leaves with a gift.  In addition, the raffle provides a chance at quality prizes for the price of a raffle ticket.  Last year's raffle included a child's bicycle.","Community Crossroads Association (CCA) will help promote the event through their website and newsletter to their membership.  The Arts Crossroads neighborhood would benefit by having a new set of customers that typically do not patronize  their businesses.

Nearly three quarters of patrons for the Series travel to the Folly from outside Kansas City. The Series is devoted to celebrating, preserving, and expanding audience appreciation of Kansas City's rich jazz heritage, and features a mix of national and internationally renowned artists and a balance of traditional and innovative jazz styles. Grammy Award~winning veterans and emerging signature artists alike take the Folly stage. For some artists, this is their first performance experience in Kansas City and an opportunity to learn firsthand about its deep jazz history. Dates and artists for the 2018~2019 season currently are in the negotiation phase, and are subject to change, however the potential roster includes such notable performers as:  Gregory Porter, vocalist; Jason Moran, pianist; Acoustic Alchemy, acoustic guitar band; Ingrid Jensen Trio, with Ingrid Jensen, trumpet; Kandace Springs (Spotlight Artist), a singer/songwriter/pianist; Kurt Elling Trio, with Kurt Elling, vocalist, who has been named ""Male Singer of the Year"" eight times. The Folly Jazz Series provides a unique forum for the performer and audience through JazzTalks, held before each concert. During each pre~concert JazzTalk, the artist is interviewed informally onstage by a celebrity guest host (Example: local musicians, journalists, music educators, radio and TV personalities or museum directors, etc.) with comments and questions accepted from the audience.

In the 2016 ~2017 season, we tracked patrons who came from 10 additional states and Canada to a performance on the Jazz Series. The Folly is fortunate to have many standing relationships with Downtown hotels and restaurants, and is using these outlets to promote the Series, and connect to a broader audience via promotional flyers and special ticket offers. During the 2017~2018 season, the Theater and Tom's Town Distillery plan to host a series of before concert Happy Hours with ""young friends of the Folly"" as a target audience. Strong affiliations with all area Chambers of Commerce, in particular the Hispanic and Gay/Lesbian Chambers, offer the Folly partnerships for broadening the reach and effectiveness of our marketing efforts. In addition, the Folly works in collaboration with VisitKC, the American Jazz Museum, Jazz Ambassadors, Jazz ALIVE, the UMKC Conservatory of Music and Dance, and the Kansas City Art Institute to promote the Jazz Series to all Kansas City area residents, as well as to visitors and university alumni groups. Our marketing and promotional campaigns previously relied heavily on print advertising, however in the 2018~2019 season, we plan to use more of the relationship oriented vehicles of digital and social media, plus radio, to create awareness, generate interest and build attendance. Print media will remain a part of our marketing strategy, albeit on a reduced level.

Nearly 75% of Jazz Series patrons come from households outside of Kansas City. Over the past three years, our Series attendees include residents of 33 different states. The Folly works closely with VisitKC to promote the Jazz Series through the state and region. In addition, collaborations with the American Jazz Museum, Jazz Ambassadors, Jazz ALIVE, the UMKC Conservatory and Kansas City Art Institute promote Kansas City as a tourism destination for jazz enthusiasts.  The 2015~2016 season included initial efforts to implement a multiyear digital/social media marketing campaign to reach several thousand nonresident tourists. This implementation continues in 2017~2018, and will be expanded if NTDF grant funding is approved.","As part of the Downtown revitalization that began in the late 1970s, the Folly is at the heart of the arts and culture renaissance that has made Kansas City the creative crossroads of America. Jazz is a top component of Kansas City's cultural profile. A series that brings national and international talent to our community should be a source of pride, and a key local attraction as well as a tourist draw. The Folly's Jazz Series and historic reputation position it  among the most diverse nonprofit performing arts organizations in the region. The Jazz Series presents a racially and culturally rich cross section of artists which reflect the diversity of the audience that attends these concerts. The Folly seeks to fulfill its mission by being a contributor to the increased vitality and growth of Downtown Kansas City.  Vitality and growth are valued ancillary benefits for the residents and businesses in our neighborhood.","The Folly Jazz Series is presented in the heart of Downtown Kansas City, providing exceptional arts experiences for Downtown residents and tourists in an historic, ornate, intimate theater. The Folly seeks to attract thousands of regional arts patrons to visit Downtown for these jazz concerts. These patrons enjoy the businesses, restaurants, bars and vibrant neighborhood around our theater. From parking fees to hotel stays, audiences for the Folly Jazz Series create a direct economic impact on our community and neighborhood. Several Downtown businesses advertise in the Jazz Series program book, or otherwise receive sponsorship recognition for their support of the Folly.","We utilize varied methodologies for measuring success. These include: ticket sales as compared to previous seasons (growth/participation); professional reviews in multiple print and online arts publications (artistic quality); audience response during and following a performance (meeting audience expectations); audience feedback received at our Box Office and in correspondence with staff (meeting audience expectations); feedback from the artists (artistic experience); solicited opinions from professional colleagues in the community and area who personally attend the concerts (artistic quality); and financial performance of the concerts. Ticket sales cover less than 60% of the Series costs. The balance must be covered by grants and other contributed income. We have not had the resources in recent years to develop and implement a formal tool for evaluation of performances, and to capture specific demographic information. It is a goal of our marketing team to build a more definitive means of collecting this data. However, as we have created strong ties to our audience members and community cohorts, we use these sources to garner broad and varied commentary that assists our leadership in measuring the Series' success, and to advise on future concert possibilities.","Audience demographics will be collected through box office records (zip code analysis) and nonscientific audience surveys. The Folly staff strives to capture email or other social media contact information for each concert attendee and uses this to communicate post~concert.  In addition, our volunteer usher staff is attentive to the needs of every patron, and is particularly trained to assist a patron with a disability or special need. These volunteers will help gather anecdotal data on the audience, and will offer informed, but not definitive, comments on the ages and racial characteristics of each concert group.","POINT (-94.587121 39.100075)","39.1003676 -94.587191"

We maintain communications with the staff of Visit KC to participate in individual marketing and media initiatives as they arise. We distribute our season brochures, postcards and targeted appeals to the area hotels that host conventions and conferences. We forge connections with the coordinators of individual conferences and conventions whenever possible. BAS collaborates to draw new audience members and cross market between genres to offer fresh, inspiring performances; BAS selects convenient, centrally located venues and partners with various organizations in marketing. While the target audience for the Community Concerts is mainly adults of all ages, many young people attend these concerts. Marketing includes postcard mailings sent to all previous attendees of BAS concerts, newspaper and magazine ads, website announcements and eblasts, free and paid advertising. Recently, BAS has increased its usage of facebook and twitter. We also do ""street teaming"" and put brochures all across town (coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, churches, Visitkc, ArtsKC, store windows, etc). BAS also forms partnerships with area groups to help market concerts  like the Asian American Chamber of Commerce, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and Friends of Jazz. Every Community Concert is a collaboration and an opportunity to reach out to groups such as these. The BachReach educational series is targeted to students and nontraditional audiences. BAS partners with schools and community organizations that serve children from low to moderate income homes, and seeks to reach students from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Through every collaboration, BAS seeks to introduce itself and its music to new audiences.

BAS is exceptional in that each musician (Elizabeth Suh Lane, violinist; Beau Bledsoe, guitarist; Elisa Williams Bickers, harpsichordist and Sarah Tannehill Anderson, soprano) is a worldclass artist with extensive performance experience and an international following. Elizabeth Suh Lane is founder, artistic director, and solo violinist of BAS. She was a first violinist with the London Symphony Orchestra, and performs regularly with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Last year, the 574 attendees, representing 18 zip codes, had the opportunity to learn about 55 school options  asking questions of school administrators, parents and student representatives, and learning about the enrollment process. 98% of the completed participant surveys indicated that the fair was &#34;Helpful&#34; or &#34;Very Helpful&#34; in deepening their understanding of school options. Additionally, 89 percent said the City School Fair increased their confidence in Kansas Citys schools.One of the strengths of the K-12 City School Fair can be attributed to collaboration. In addition to co-hosting the City School Fair with the Kansas City Public Library and the Office of the Mayor, the following groups participate in the planning of the City School Fair as part of our Task Force: Kansas City Public Schools, Academie Lafayette, Operation Breakthrough, Hogan Prep Academy and Jumpstart. Additionally, we are inviting other education nonprofits, like KC Scholars, Start at Zero and MPACT to host tables at the fair. These strong partnerships, combined with the robust participation of the schools, will allow us to continue growing the success and reputation of the fair. While the focus of the fair is one-on-one conversations between families and schools, our organization makes every effort to make it a fun event for the whole family. High school students paint faces in the childrens section of the library, school bands perform, free food is offered, balloon artists roam, Jumpstart volunteers keep young children engaged and Sluggerrr entertains his fans. We expect over 600 attendees for our third annual City School Fair on November 10, 2018 and would be humbled to partner with the Neighborhood Tourist Development Fund on the event. We believe the City School Fair is a unique opportunity for our citys families to be in one central location together, united by a common desire to find the best school for their children, right here in Kansas City.","4","4","Kansas City Public Library - Central Library","14 W 10th St.","64105",,"Educational","Downtown Neighborhood Association","625","40","Annual","15231","0","0",,"Show Me KC Schools mission is to help Kansas City families make well-informed decisions about their childs education by providing vital information about the school options available. For decades our community has worked to improve Kansas Citys schools, but parents have largely been left out of these conversations. Research shows that when parents actively participate in the school choice process, the outcomes are positive for families and schools. But with nearly 90 district, charter, private and parochial schools in KCPS boundaries, navigating school options can be confusing and overwhelming. Parents need to have meaningful school information to ask the right questions on school tours and identify schools that are right for their children. Recognizing the need for accessible school information, a group of concerned Kansas City parents, committed to living in the city, conceived the idea for Show Me KC Schools in the fall of 2013. Show Me KC Schools supports families with six key programs: our online school guide; our printed school guide; the City School Fair; school tours; family workshops; and one-on-one school navigation support. With an increase in families engagement in the school enrollment process, we believe we will see a continued pattern of increase in the number of students enrolled in our citys schools and more families moving into KC neighborhoods. In 2014, enrollment in our district and charter schools was 24,169 and by 2017 public school enrollment increased to 25,840. Show Me KC Schools is working to steadily increase that number every year through our resources and programs, like the City School Fair, celebrating the uniqueness of our school landscape and motivating families to stay or move to our city and enroll in our schools.","Thoughtful marketing of the City School Fair is key to the events success. We are eager to have the support of the Mayors Office, once again, promoting the event via social media. The Kansas City Public Library is a key promotional partner, as well, including the City School Fair on their website, in email blasts, kiosks, and in their printed newsletters to patrons. With the support of the Neighborhood Tourist Development Fund, we will mail invitations to approximately 11,000 families covering all 23 zip codes within KCPS boundaries, distribute approximately 250 yard signs, purchase five billboards (at a special nonprofit rate), boost targeted social media campaigns, advertise in the Northeast News and Dos Mundos, and seek PSAs from radio stations. Our Director of Programs will also explore new partnerships with organizations, like KCADC, to promote this event to the larger community.",,"Show Me KC Schools anticipates that families living outside of KC, but who have KC on their short list of places to move, would consider checking out the school options and traveling to KC for our annual event. We hope the positive energy of the fair, its diverse group of participants, and the opportunity to connect with so many school leaders, will encourage prospective Kansas Citians to contemplate moving to our city and enrolling their children in our schools. This event has a unique appeal, providing much than just have short-term entertainment value for families, but the potential to influence major family decisions and, in some cases, relocate families to our city.Through our promotional efforts, we believe that tourists visiting KC on the City School Fair weekend would be encouraged to learn about a welcoming family event Downtown, featuring free food and entertainment, while also discovering more about our education landscape. We are not aware of any other K-12 school fairs in our country that bring together district, charter and private schools  an event like this would be a unique program for visitors to participate in.","For many of the 30,000 families with school-aged children living in the Kansas City Public Schools boundaries, there is great curiosity and varied questions surrounding our schools. What is a charter school? Are Kansas City Public Schools really growing stronger? Why do so many of our private schools have such a strong reputation? In fact, the average kindergartner living in the Kansas City Public Schools boundaries has over 30 school options. This is the only opportunity to visit many of our citys schools under one roof in an informal and engaging way.The City School Fair is not only educational, but also a free and fun celebration for the whole family. It is located in our most beautiful library facility  arguably in all of MO; it is a fun adventure heading Downtown; we will showcase local school talent through elementary and high school performances; and it is the only event of the year  in the entire state of MO  like it.","We love having the City School Fair in the Downtown Loop. The Kansas City Library provides free parking and is located on all major bus routes and the street car line. Additionally, Show Me KC Schools will provide three (free!) shuttle buses for families who live in neighborhoods with limited access to transportation. Because the event is from 10 a.m.  1 p.m., we find that many families are inclined to stay Downtown and enjoy the River Market, take walks along the river in Berkeley Park, have lunch in the Power & Light District or hop on the street car to Union Station or Crown Center. What may start as a school fair can become an entire day of exploration and enjoyment of Downtown.","We will measure the success by the number of participants and zip codes represented, as well as the educational value of the fair. In addition to the greeter who will count the number of participants, we will have a survey that we ask participants to complete as they exit. All participants who complete the survey are entered into a drawing for one of three $50 Target gift cards. We expect that 80% of City School Fair participants who responded to our survey will indicate that the fair was a valuable part of their familys school search. Our survey will ask the following questions:1. On a scale of 1-5, how helpful was this event in helping you understand the school options available? 2.  Does todays event make you feel more or less confident about our citys school options? 3. How did you hear about the event? 4. Why did you attend this event? 5. What grades did you learn about today? 6.  What was the most valuable part of the City School Fair? 7. Other Comments/Feedback","Show Me KC Schools will have a greeter at the front doors of the library welcoming community members and asking if they came to the library for the City School Fair. If they respond affirmatively, the greeter will use his/her clicker to count them as school fair participants. We will have two tables set up in the front of the library where volunteers will ask participants to kindly sign in and include their zip codes. While we typically have one family member sign in for the whole family, we will tally families zip codes at the end of the fair.","POINT (-94.583871 39.102239)","39.1026894 -94.5838852"

Launched in 2015, City Markets Wednesday Farmers Market (WFM) is continuing to gain momentum in large part due to the exposure and support from the Wednesday Market Promotional Series. The WFM features a variety of local farmers, youth vendors, local artists and vintage sellers held weekly from 2-6pm June through August. Establishing a fledgling market is gradual and requires a delicate and consistent balance between vendors, product offering and customers across many seasons. Over the course of the last two seasons, Farmers Market managers have collected and distilled data from vendor feedback, visitor surveys and operational outcomes to refine and grow the WFM offering and strategy. In 2018, WFM will likely be renamed Wednesday Mini Market and the Wednesday Market Promotional Series will focus on targeted marketing, promotion and on-site visibility to grow patronage and vendor interest. The Wednesday Market Promotional Series will also provide food-centric and grower-focused edu-tainment as well as targeted promotional support to grow patronage.The WMF provides the community and neighborhood with a much-needed midweek opportunity to shop for local produce in a less congested, more intimate atmosphere. It also provides underserved people in nearby communities and food desserts with an opportunity to use SNAP and Double Up Bucks benefits. It also exposes the City Market to business travelers, conference attendees and commuters who are regularly downtown during the work week but are less likely to frequent the area on weekends. In addition to helping connect the WFM vendors and shoppers, the Wednesday Market Promotional Series attracts activity, stimulates area economy and creates a demand for City Market and River Market shops and restaurants.City Market continues a long tradition as an entrepreneurial hub for both unique and ethnic small businesses as well as serving as a venue for the City of Kansas City Missouris Farmers Market, the largest farmers market in the region. The City Market remains a gathering place for the community; a destination that crosses all socio-economic lines and cultures and provides customers the unique opportunity to shop directly from local and regional farmers. The City Market provides a continued spark for new development, promotions and programs thereby creating a strong draw to downtown. With the introduction of the KC Streetcar in 2016, the area has seen increased foot traffic. Friends of the City Markets goal is to position the Market as a dynamic destination for tourists as well as those living in the neighborhood, locals from the surrounding communities and a must-see for tourists.","4","4","City Market Square","5th & Walnut","64106",,"Social","The City Market is located to the immediate north of downtown Kansas City in the heart of the historic River Market District.

The City Markets central location is not only convenient for local residents and those who frequent downtown, but also it's an attractive destination for tourists and KansasCitians in outlying areas looking to experience local nuance of historic Kansas City, an eclectic shopping experience, and an opportunity to shop at the Farmers Market.","65000","2000000","Series Of Events","15000","5000","5000","180272","Friends of the City Market is a nonprofit corporation and is organized exclusively for charitable purposes within the meaning ofSection 501 (c) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and shall be operated as a public benefit corporation for thebenefit of Kansas City, Missouri, and its residents.

FOCM has had a great deal of success using social media marketing tools for an excellent ROI; we plan to continue and grow our overall social media presence and strategy and apply it to individual event marketing as well.",,"It is common for someone on a business trip, at a convention or visiting family to make it a priority to stop at destinations which reflect the unique culture and local flavor of a city. Those people are looking for something that offers an experience unique to thetown they visit and a Wednesday Farmers Market and the Wednesday Market Promotional Series definitely do just that. Attracting visitors from near and far, many non-residents come to visit the City Market, and the Wednesday Market Promotional Series will provide a City Market and River Market experience beyond what they would experience on a typical Farmer Market weekend.  It allows tourists a positive and compelling glimpse of Kansas City in one of its most historic neighborhoods, as well as showcases the diversity and wide range of produce vendors, shopping, dining and ethnic specialty grocers. Non-residents planning a vacation or day trip find the notoriety of the City Market and special events a must-see-and-do destination, and this series enhances their experience that much more -- especially on a weekday.","A Wednesday Market Promotional Series will appeal to individuals from a wide variety of demographics in the metro area and will be geared toward the entire community, including individuals, families and couples. Particularly those who are food and health conscious. This series will continue to build momentum from last year attracting new visitors from community as well as return patronage cultivated in past seasons. The Wednesday Market Promotional Series will provide exposure of the River Market/City Market area to new visitors, increase awareness of the number and variety of merchants and restaurants in the district and increase revenue for participating vendors, merchants and restaurants. Regular visitors spur word-of-mouth advertising so we expect the Wednesday Market population to continue to increase and bring new patrons -- exposing them to the most culturally diverse shopping and dining area in Kansas City. Just like the Farmers' Market on weekends, the Wednesday Market is intended to draw people from all areas of the city, stimulating the economy along the way. It's also very evident that access to healthy, local fruits and vegetables at affordable prices will directly benefit the health and well being of consumers wherever they live. Other area neighborhoods that City Market events residually impact include: River Market, Columbus Park, Downtown Kansas City, West Bottoms, Quality Hill, West Side, East Bottoms, and Columbus Park, Northeast Neighborhood.","The City Market is the heart of the River Market neighborhood and offers a truly unique shopping and dining experience which improves the quality of life in the neighborhood. The City Market is the corner stone of the River Market whose notoriety andregional and national recognition brings constant exposure to the surrounding area. This Wednesday Market Promotional Series will draw even more patrons from all of the metropolitan and regional area thereby exposing regular and new shoppers to the neighborhood. It will introduce new users to the variety of restaurants the neighborhood has to offer and they may not be aware of or would not typically go out of their comfort zone to try something new. Everything the City Market does will heightens awareness of the River Market neighborhood as an integral part of Kansas City. It brings more people to the area and increases the economic impact to the River Market for both residents and businesses alike. The City Market works closely with the River Market Community Association, RMCID, Downtown Council, Downtown Neighborhood Association and area residential developments to combine promotional efforts through website, e-blasts, Facebook and Twitter exposure to inform neighborhood residents and encourage attendance. We also value relationships with other community partners like KC Streetcar, City of Kansas City Communications, Art in the Loop and others who have a strong local presence and social media reach and help cross-promote each other's events, news and programs. And last but not least, when NTDF support is involved, we leverage the a valuable network of promotional resources through the Office of Culture and Creative Services.","As mentioned above, we are now receiving monthly reports from Cisco/Sprint based on phone pings that provide robust vital information including monthly/hourly visitor information as well as their dwell time, peak hours, peak day, first time visit, repeat visitors and more. This information will provide a very accurate picture of attendance during event hours, success of the event in terms of dwell time, proof of performance in terms of attracting new visitors/tourists and more. Additionally, we thoroughly track and document customer counts, sales and vendor turnout/mix. This information is cataloged with weather information and other attendance-influencing information and carefully monitored for trends and growth patterns. We also engage patrons and vendors directly with in-person and online surveys. We also use sales information from City Market merchants and vendors to evaluate how events affect and stimulate sales. We also monitor digital activity closely including social media comments, posts, photo shares and reviews on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Yelp, etc. and use it to gauge and refine event design, customer satisfaction, pre-event interest/reach and post event comments.","New this year: we are now receiving monthly data capture reports from a network of Cisco/Sprint collection nodes on property.

We're gradually amassing this information to provide even more accurate customer counts and information, but it's already revealing how much more important the City Market is to downtown than we even thought. We also utilize existing resources including population statistics as well as our own metrics generated by website and social media traffic.

The result is unique and innovative programming that entertains and educates.  As in previous years, Summerfest will present its chamber music festival in July, 2018; July 13through August 5. Each program will be presented twice- once on Saturday evening and once on Sunday afternoon. Saturday concerts will be held at White Recital Hall (475 seats) and, Sunday concerts are presented at St. Mary's Episcopal Church (250seats) Summerfest is also in the final stages of determining  the possibility of participation in the Kansas City Fringe Festival for 2018. This will be our third year participating as a presenter in the Fringe Festival.  Summerfest's programming provides a variety of unique instrumentation and musical styles, and features lesser-known pieces from all eras, including works and appearances by living composers. While programming for the 2018 concert series has not been finalized, we are confident that patrons will enjoy eclectic programs highlighting intersections of styles, genres, and even other art forms.   Summerfest's 2018 season will reflect their mantra ""The Art and Soul of Chamber Music"" with weekly programming  reflecting works associated with the themes of visual ""art"" and spiritual  (""soul"") reflection.  We are working to incorporate collaborations with other art mediums where appropriate.  Repertoire will include works from the baroque through the present day featuring works by J.S. Bach, Nico Muhly, and many others.Following each performance, audience members will be invited to a Meet the Musician reception. This reception is included in the cost of admission to the concert, and gives the musicians and the audience an opportunity to connect on a personal level. Patrons want to know how the music was selected, how many hours of rehearsal time they invest for each concert, how many instruments they play, and about the musicians personal musical journey. Summerfest musicians have an opportunity to receive feedback first-hand from patrons about the concert. Summerfest musicians probably know their audiences better than most performing groups in the area.  These receptions give patrons and musicians an opportunity for personal interaction that they are not likely to have at other concerts in Kansas City. Each year, our local musicians perform various outreach events throughout the community, reaching people who might not otherwise have an opportunity to experience live classical music.","6","4","James C Olson Performing Arts Center, White Recital Hall","4949 Cherry","64110","St. Mary's Episcopal Church1307 Holmes St, Kansas City, MO 64106Outreach events TBD","Cultural","The concert at White Recital Hall takes place in the 49/63 Coalition.

At the performances staff and volunteers distribute programs describing the musicians and providing contact information. Through these concerts, Art in the Loop is providing a free, high-quality, cultural and entertainment experience that showcases the diversity of music Kansas City has to offer. Were also providing Kansas Citians the opportunity to experience music performances in easily accessible spaces (e.g. onboard KC Streetcar, Library, Park) with a low commitment.  The audience does not need to purchase tickets in advance or enter what might be an intimidating theater. We find this appeals to families and tourists as well as Downtown employees who need a break and wish to explore the city on their lunch hour.  Last year, we also discovered that local elementary schools and summer camps scheduled field trips to enjoy our music performances in City Market Park and at the KC Public Library.  We will continue to promote our series to schools and will also promote the scavenger hunt to the schools. Another specific audience we discovered last year is running groups.  One of our 2017 artists created a signed walking/running trail through Downtown highlighting public art and historical locations.  She scheduled several groups with local organizations that had twenty to fifty attendees at each run.  Some of these same groups will be interested in our scavenger hunt.","This project promotes the arts and culture present in Downtown Kansas City.

The scavenger hunt will promote these cultural aspects of the Downtown neighborhood.  Promotion will occur via social media, advertising, online presence, distribution of maps and calendars and through the events themselves.","We measure the success of our projects based on attendance, audience reviews, musicians/artists impact statements, social media interactions, and media attention.  Art in the Loop staff attend each performance and visually count audience participants while also collecting general demographic information.  Staff also interacts with the audience during and after the performance to gather input about the performances.  Audience members are often interested in learning more about the musicians and more about other cultural experiences available in Kansas City. Social media has played an important role in promoting the events and allowing us to engage in conversations with our audience before and after performances. We actively engage our audience on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter with multiple posts weekly and even daily.  Here are a few quotes -  Perfect lunchtime entertainment; I have seen so many posts but this was my first experience; Thank you for all for this partnership! - Just sat down in the @VisitKC @KCstreetcar to read about @ArtintheLoop! Another cool thing the city does to enhance the cultural landscape. Each year we request written statements from our participants in which they describe the impact the performance for them as well as any suggestions for our changes to the overall project.  We use these statements to improve our project as we continually strive to be fresh and meaningful to the community.","We estimate attendance at music performances visually and use a counter to record the attendance; we also record the ethnicity, age, and gender of the audience visually. Based on our visual survey, last year 45% of our audience was female, 28% were people of color and 20% were children. Our performances are not ticketed, so we don't have an easy way to collect demographic or locational data on the audience.

For approximately 18 months, the residents selected to participate in the project commit to planning, designing, and creating collaborative arts-focused projects, community outreach dialogue, and host community events, meals and gatherings - with the input and cooperation of the immediate neighborhood and community members from the Troost Corridor. The Troost NAR program will be an effort to dedicate a space specific to the needs of the community, and to develop a denser and more consistent cadence of artist outreach. In this location, residents and community participants will be creating cultural events that will appeal to and build audiences within their neighborhood and contribute to a long-overlooked community. These varied projects include, but are not limited to: Youth Theatre at the Manheim Community Gardens Stage, an art exhibit at the Troost NAR Collaboration Center, documentation of the Troost NAR project, spoken word performances, writing workshops focusing on the needs of people of color poets, arts and economics workshop series, an art and community gardens program, a &#34;Create Your Own Coloring Book&#34; workshop, a 6-part series of fiber art workshops, a Troost NAR Collaboration Center mural, The Perpetual Motion Project (a half-day performative event), film screenings and mixers, and a Kansas City Marathon neighborhood sign-making workshop.","4","34","CSF Neighborhood Artists Residency Collaboration Center","4001 Troost Avenue","64109","Manheim Community Gardens: 4229 Forest Ave, Kansas City, MO 64110; Anita B.

We cultivate the contemporary, the exceptional, and the unexpected in the practice of artists working in and engaging with the Kansas City art community. Founded in 1997, Charlotte Street Foundation (CSF) supports and recognizes outstanding artists in Kansas City; promotes, enhances, and encourages the visual, performing, literary and interdisciplinary arts; and fosters community development in the greater Kansas City region. Through innovation and responsiveness to the real needs expressed by Kansas City&#39;s community of artists, Charlotte Street has established itself as a nationally recognized model for supporting artists, contributing significantly to the development of the local arts community, and advocating for the important cultural and economic impact of local artists and grassroots arts activity. Through financially supporting, presenting, and promoting the work of contemporary Kansas City area artists, Charlotte Street has enhanced Kansas City&#39;s vitality as a regional center for contemporary art. During 2018-2019, Charlotte Street will continue to offer key programming that has made the organization an innovative leader in support of individual artists including: 1. AWARDS & GRANTS: Five unrestricted cash awards and two travel grants will be given to Kansas City artists as chosen by an esteemed panel of jurors. Through Andy Warhol&#39;s re-granting program, Charlotte street administers 6-8 grants each year for progressive, innovative, public facing art projects and commissions. 2. ARTIST & CURATORIAL RESIDENCIES: Supporting an 18-month curatorial residency program connecting local artists with national artists in discussions & exhibitions. Providing free studio and exhibition space for 80+ artists each year including mentoring and professional development. Troost Neighborhood Artist Residency, the focus of this proposal, is an artist driven, community focused project designed to serve, support and amplify the narrative of the Troost Corridor through workshops, performances, exhibits, and community meals. Participating residents plan, design, and create arts projects or programs - with the input and cooperation of the immediate neighborhood and community members. 3. EXHIBITIONS & PUBLIC PROGRAMS: Providing opportunities for local artists and curators to propose projects including exhibitions, performances and other events through a competitive selection process. Other public programs include an annual Open Studios program and Artboards billboard commissions presented by Mobank. Charlotte Street partners with Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, H&R Block Artspace at Kansas City Art Institute and the Folly Theater to attract new programming and recognition for artists in Kansas City and for our artist community.","Charlotte Street Foundation will distribute printed cards and programs to hotels, tourist destinations in the wider Kansas City area, and information centers such as Union Station. Thanks to CSF&#39;s strong network of programming partners across Kansas City, the organization frequently partners to cross-promote events and exhibitions. Additionally, Charlotte Street Foundation is an active user of the city-wide ArtsKC Go calendar, having supported the development as a beta user and early adopter. Through ArtsKC Go, CSF attracts residents and out-of-town visitors alike, offering a robust sampling of cultural arts opportunities, and clear and easy access to event schedules, tickets, and information. Charlotte Street regularly participates and partners with national art associations and other Kansas City arts organizations to support and present conferences and conventions such as the 2016 NCECA conference, the 2017 International Sculpture Conference, and the 2018 Open Spaces initiative. Charlotte Street Foundation&#39;s Troost Neighborhood Artists Residency specifically addresses the impact of neighborhood-level tourism, through information sessions about the Neighborhood Tourist Development Fund program where refreshments are provided by the residency and materials recognizing an ongoing support of the artists&#39; community are distributed. Additionally, rolling opportunities are available to organizations involved in the tourism industry to hold event planning meetings or other opportunities that the Troost NAR space and rent can provide.","The Troost Neighborhood Artists Residency, through Charlotte Street Foundation, is a member of the Historic Manheim Park Association (HMPA), whose vision is to be a vibrant and interconnected community, creating neighborhood investment, with strong homes and businesses united around a common goal for a restorative future. Accordingly, CSF will work closely to promote the Troost Neighborhood Artist Residency programs through the HMPA facebook page, and have already identified opportunities to partner with local businesses, neighborhood groups, schools, and other arts organizations to align programming with other events and programs, and provide opportunities for visitors to Residency events to extend their time in the Manheim Neighborhood by visiting other art and cultural organizations and patronizing neighborhood restaurants and businesses. Some of the Troost Neighborhood Artists Residency collaborations will bridge adjacent neighborhoods along the Troost Corridor, including those mentioned above.","Charlotte Street&#39;s broad range of programming, taking place in established, emerging, and impromptu sites throughout Kansas City for the past two decades, has proven to be a significant attraction to visitors traveling to Kansas City for arts and culture. We estimate that more than half of our audience members travel from outside the city to participate in cultural activities in Kansas City, Missouri, underscoring a recently released report by Americans for the Arts, which indicated that 81% of tourists who attended an arts or cultural event traveled to Kansas City traveled for that specific purpose. In 2018, as a confederation of arts and civic organizations work in partnership with the City of Kansas City, Missouri, to attract national and international festival-goers to a major contemporary art fair, Charlotte Street Foundation is certain to attract hundreds if not thousands of attendees to visit its exhibitions and attend programming featuring Kansas City&#39;s most cutting-edge contemporary artists. The community-focused programming that will be presented at the Neighborhood Artist Residency in the Troost Corridor will offer visitors to Kansas City a one-of-a-kind opportunity to experience Kansas City&#39;s cultural richness, by connecting to an off-the-beaten-path community with the most innovative, independent, and forward-thinking artists and local neighborhood groups. Its proximity to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as its proximity to an up-and-coming neighborhood, will provide visitors to Kansas City with a broadened view of Kansas City&#39;s rich community of artists by providing an expanded view of the wide-ranging work being produced by Kansas City artists. The work being presented within this new program will be unduplicated within Kansas City. The Troost Neighborhood Artist Residency has worked to engage with both established tourism districts like the 18th and Vine area and the Nelson-Atkins Museum/Kemper Museum neighborhoods; and new/emerging tourism districts such as the Union Hill neighborhood and Historic Overland Park in Kansas City. Programming in these kinds of untraditional art spaces are attractive to those seeking &#34;real&#34; Kansas City experiences outside of the conventional tourism centers, and visitors especially interested in creative enterprise who seek out socially engaged art and arts activism will be excited to see an example of a creative city utilizing community-led art programming. The residency program is at the intersection of convention groups within different disciplines, including historical, cultural, social, as well as art tourists. These tourists to The Neighborhood Artists Residency will be engaged with Kansas City&#39;s history of redlining and will have the opportunity to creatively explore the cultural and social background of the city. Finally, the program will be a showcase to artist&#39;s programs, skills, and the city&#39;s creative impulse.","The Troost Corridor has been long-overlooked as a destination for art and cultural programming in Kansas City. A recent surge in development in the Crossroads Arts District and Downtown has pushed many artists and arts-focused organizations to seek other neighborhoods to create and grow their artistic support and practices. The Troost Corridor has become one of those destinations, and its close proximity to the desirable Crossroads and Downtown neighborhoods puts its current residents at risk for future displacement. By building relationships and engaging with this community of residents, the Troost Neighborhood Artists Residency hopes to be a crucial part of a strong community that can weather these challenges. Over the past 21 years, as opportunities have arisen and resources available, Charlotte Street has constructed an interlocking array of programs and services that respond to the needs of local artists: spaces and resources for creating and presenting their work; opportunities for convening, collaborating, networking and community building; professional development and mentorship; platforms for critical dialogue, exposure and feedback; and opportunities to reach and connect with new audiences and patrons. By providing opportunities for artists to develop work, explore ideas and methods, experiment and take risks, gain exposure and expand their networks, and increase their professional acumen, they are able to reach new audiences, improve the sustainability of their careers, and contribute to the large cultural dynamic that makes Kansas City unique. No other Kansas City arts organization provides this unique mix of programs designed specifically for contemporary artists to develop individually and collectively, and to help artists build sustainable careers. The artistic excellence and unique quality of Charlotte Street&#39;s programming has established the organization as a national model, and developed a tremendously committed audience and support network within Kansas City. Throughout 2017, Charlotte Street connected and engaged across the city in celebration of its 20th anniversary, building partnerships with nearly 20 organizations including the Kansas City Public Library, the Blue Room at the American Jazz Museum, the Kansas City Museum, H&R Block Artspace, the Nerman Museum, Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas, and more. Through this strategic effort to broaden audiences and increase awareness of CSF&#39;s programming, the organization connected with more than 39,000 audience members and programming participants in 2017. We anticipate that the new relationships and heightened public awareness will equate to continued growth in participation and attendance at CSF exhibitions, programs, and collaborations, and will help to attract audience members and visitors to CSF&#39;s Neighborhood Artist Residency programs and events.","Charlotte Street&#39;s Troost Neighborhood Artists Residency program will enrich the Troost Corridor by investing in its cultural identity. As the neighborhood&#39;s forecasted desirability increases, along with its real estate costs, many of the residents and small businesses will or have been forced out or shuttered altogether. Thanks to a generous grant with the National Endowment for the Arts, Charlotte Street Foundation has the opportunity to create a vibrant space in the Historic Manheim Park Neighborhood, and will focus on community-building and neighborhood-focused workshops, performances, exhibits, and community meals that are designed to serve, support, and amplify the narrative of the area neighborhoods. The Troost NAR Collaboration Center, located at 40th and Troost, in an area that has few opportunities for artists but has long served its community in other ways, will provide a space for artists in which to explore new ideas, meet neighborhood members, and present truly innovative and experimental community-focused and engaged projects. Audiences that have been underserved and under-engaged in current development activity will be afforded the opportunity to engage with art and artists, and artists that would not otherwise have the same opportunities to work and present in this cultural area will have time, space, and financial and promotional support to work in the Troost Corridor.","Charlotte Street regularly gathers quantitative and qualitative information on a regular basis from artists and audiences. Currently data is collected through final reports from award and residency recipients, through artist and audience surveys, small group discussions, and in-person interviews, including an exit interview with the CIR. Additional demographic and other quantitative data is collected through the program applications. Currently, the Troost Neighborhood Artists Residency is being evaluated by two consultants, Leslie Scott from CNA in Arlington, VA and Bill Cleveland from Community Arts Training in St. Louis. This information is used to help further refine and develop programs and improve our understanding of program outcomes. Every three to five years we have carried out assessments to gather opinions and ideas about CSF and its programs. A 2014 Program Assessment, carried out by the consulting firm Lutman & Associates, engaged more than 100 artists, CSF partners and other arts professionals through one-on-one interviews, small group discussions, and one large interactive workshop with artists in which observations, opinions and ideas were collected. The summary results of that work have continued to inform strategic planning and program development. In 2018, CSF will enter a new phase of artist- and audience- focused evaluation as we develop a new strategic plan. We have gathered information in a variety of ways, and periodically review our protocols against desired outcomes for programs and refine and streamline our evaluation strategy and protocols. Through a combination of both the periodic assessments carried out every three to five years and annual evaluations submitted by artists in our programs, examples of the kind of information in which we are interested includes: Has CSF&#39;s programming fostered artistic growth and increased the artistic ambition of artists? Have CSF-supported artists advanced their careers? Have new, meaningful connections & collaborations resulted among artists? Have artists expanded their professional networks? Has the program attracted a diverse, growing pool of highly qualified artist applicants? Has the program supported the creation and presentation of significant, innovative, ambitious new work? Have artists strengthened their ability and ease in communicating about their work and with audiences? With respect to audiences and the community, we seek to learn: Has the program fostered new/deeper connections between artists and members of the broader community/audience? Are audiences more likely to engage with artists and attend other arts events in the future? Have audiences increased their knowledge about, understanding of, and passion for artists and art? Has Kansas City&#39;s arts profile been elevated or enhanced as a result of Charlotte Street&#39;s programming? Is Kansas City attracting new audiences from within and beyond the greater Kansas City region as a result of Charlotte Street programming?","Data is collected through a variety of means including hand-held clickers, ticket sales, online registrations, and other means. Attendance at each Charlotte Street Foundation event is tracked and monitored using the following categories: event date, event/program type, event location, number of days event took place, number of artists served, and number of audience members served. As many of our larger events and partnerships are oriented toward particular audiences, some generalizations can be made with regard to the geography of participants and audience members. Based generally on the demographic data collected from CSF-supported artists (further articulated below), we estimate that a majority of the local/regional attendees travel from outside of Kansas City, Mo., boundaries to attend CSF programming. While Charlotte Street does not track demographic information for events and exhibitions, this information is collected for award and residency programs. Audience and participant demographics generally reflect those of the artists participating in our programming. A demographic summary of 2017 award and residency participants reflects the following demographic makeup: artists supported were 51% white, 44% people of color (7% non-reporting). Gender ratios reflects 49% male, 39% female, and 12% transgender or gender nonconforming. With regard to geography, using social media followers as an indicator, the nearly 50% of CSF&#39;s Facebook followers that are based outside of Kansas City, Mo., would likely correspond to the percentage of in-person attendees who travel from outside Kansas City to attend and participate in events and programs.","POINT (-94.572226 39.054163)","39.0540842 -94.5718932"

We consider this a huge victory in helping dispel negative perceptions of the neighborhoods within the Northeast Area and are proud to be a part of that image-improvement.","While attendance is extremely important to us, it is not the only deciding factor in considering our event's success and effectiveness.  We also consider the feedback from the attendees, where they live, what they enjoyed most (and how we can take that into consideration with our future Tours) etc.  Our event is successful when we have a minimum of 350 people attend, 1/3 of which are outside of the metropolitan area.","With each check-in at our Homes Tour, we ask, ""how did you hear about our Tour?"" and we document their responses.

The VFW tournaments served thousands of children, offering them opportunities beyond their communities and experiences that made a life-long impact. The exhibit will explore the personal stories of those who competed in these tournaments. Inspired by Playing for Keeps, the program series will kick off with The Kansas City Marble Tournament on June 9, 2018. Just as the VFW tournaments broke down barriers and provided new opportunities for children of all backgrounds, the outdoor tournament will be promoted across the city and will be free of charge. Any child may enter, and the museum will work with local schools, churches, and organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters to recruit participants. All day museum admission will be free to participants and the general public. Visitors not participating in the tournament can play a variety of nostalgic outdoor games: hopscotch, jacks, and jump rope. Inside the museum, visitors of all ages can make keychains, bracelets, and necklaces out of marbles, and compete in a marble cake walk for the chance to win another marble (or perhaps the first) for their collection. The fun will continue throughout the summer on Wednesdays and Saturdays with Little Adventures. The weekly program allows visitors to explore the museum collection through gallery talks and a hands-on workshop where they will make their own toy or miniature. Last year, Little Adventures introduced over 1,200 visitors to specific aspects of the museum collection from toys (dollhouses, stuffed animals, robots) to fine-scale miniatures (paintings, room settings, decorative arts). The 2018 workshops will offer expanded hours from 10:30am to 3:30pm in order to accommodate more visitors over the programs ten weeks. Little Adventures, recommended for ages seven and up, is included with museum admission ($5 for ages 5 and up). The summer closes with T/m's annual free admission day, Farewell to Summer Free Day, on Saturday, August 18. The event is promoted across the metro area, and the museum works with nonprofit organizations that serve children, families, and disadvantaged populations to share the event with their constituencies. Activities include a hands-on craft and the premiere of a brand new scavenger hunt. Once all the answers are located, visitors can plug them into a ""Museum Lib"" to tell the story of their unique adventure and collect a prize.","4","4","The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures","5235 Oak Street","64112","N/A","Educational","T/ms census neighborhood is Crestwood.

In addition to promoting the Playing for Keeps exhibit, the museums outreach to convention attendees will include all of the summer programming opportunities. The museum will work with VisitKC to promote all of the events and reach other convention attendees who may be interested in the programs. Additionally, all of the summer series will be highlighted in monthly and special event emails (see attachments for examples) to the museum's list of over 2,500 addresses, which includes individuals across the Kansas City metro area and around the United States. Two postcard mailings will be sent to the museums list and the 64112 zip code (see attachments for an example from last year). T/m will partner with the neighborhood associations to encourage their residents to attend. The museum will also partner with marble-related business, clubs, and collectors, including Moon Marble in Bonner Springs, Kansas.The Playing for Keeps exhibit and the summer programming will be promoted through press releases, advertisements, media appearances on local television and radio, associated stories in local and regional publications, on family-friendly websites and publications, such as Sprout and About and Family Media Groups KC Parent and KC Going Places, and on all the T/ms communication channels, including website, e-newsletters, blog, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Instagram. The museums social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) have over 5,000 national and international followers.",,"The VFW marble tournament served thousands of kids and offered them opportunities beyond their home communities. These experiences had a life-long impact on the tournament participants. A seminal historical exhibit on the topic, Playing for Keeps explores the impact the tournament had on the lives of the participants through the objects they lovingly preserved from their experience, as well as photos and ephemera. Many of these participants and their families will be visiting Kansas City for the exhibit and related events. Through historical documentation, photographs, objects, and hands-on interactives, the Playing for Keeps exhibit and related summer programming will introduce marble playing to a new generation, create nostalgia for older visitors who remember playing marbles, and create an opportunity for intergenerational sharing. The nostalgia of the event and desire to share the experience with new generations will draw participants to the events. The tournament may also appeal to participants who have competed in other local tournaments: the first and second place winner of the Shawnee Town Tournament held over Memorial Day weekend in Shawnee, Kansas, will receive a first-round bye in the Kansas City Marble Tournament. Moon Marble also hosts a tournament in Bonner Springs every May. T/m will also reach out to participants of the two largest marble tournaments in the United States: the National Marble Tournament in Wildwood, New Jersey, and the National Rolley Hole Marble Championships in Nashville, Tennessee. T/m will work with show organizers to attract participants to the many marble shows held throughout the Midwest and the United States each year; for example, the Des Moines Marble Show is held every year in June. As mentioned above, T/m will partner with the VFW for their national convention in Kansas City at the end of July 2018. Visitors from out of town looking for reasonably-priced, family-friendly activities will be attracted to the summer program series. Additionally, the museum will hire three student interns from across the United States to assist with the Little Adventures program series.","Working with local community, civic, nonprofit, and neighborhood organizations, T/m aims to introduce new audiences and generations to the simple, yet captivating, game of marbles, and foster lifelong museum visitation and the informal learning that such visits offer. Centered around the nostalgia of play and the art of miniatures, T/ms programs appeal to a wide demographic. The Kansas City Marble Tournament presents the opportunity for children to have a unique, historically-inspired, and free-of-charge experience. Marble playing teaches sportsmanship, sparks creativity, instills problem solving skills, and develops manual dexterity. Home to the headquarters of the VFW, Kansas City is the perfect place to bring people together to revive the art of knuckling down and explore this fascinating chapter of American history. Little Adventures offers a unique way to engage with the collection and take part in a family-friendly activity that offers quality time together to engage with each other, the community, and history. A new theme every week allows for multiple opportunities to build new skills and a love of lifelong learning. Every summer, returning participants tell museum staff that Little Adventures is one of their favorite summer activities. While designed with children and families in mind, many adults have spent all of the available program time perfecting their miniature masterpiece or dollhouse furniture. Farewell to Summer Free Day was originally created for individuals for whom the museum's regular admission price was a barrier. Since then, the museum has reached out annually to local nonprofits that serve and support children, families, and disadvantaged populations. It is our hope that museum visitors will have stimulating, fun, and educational experiences that will connect them to their family members, the museum, and their community in new and exciting ways.","The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures is a landmark and cultural cornerstone for the neighborhood. T/m strives to build stronger relationships with the museums neighbors by forming partnerships, promoting local businesses to visitors, and developing special promotions with local restaurants and stores. The entire program series will help the museum to build these relationships by bringing visitors to the neighborhood who will enjoy the museum, and then want to eat lunch or dinner. Museum staff consistently encourage museum visitors to frequent local establishments at the corner of 51st and Oak, as well as the Crestwood shops on 55th street between Brookside Blvd and Oak Street and establishments in Brookside, especially between Wornall and Main Street from 62nd to Meyer Blvd.","Museum staff will develop an evaluation plan for the summer program series, which will include tracking visitor attendance and demographics, gathering visitor comments, and determining the effectiveness of the desired understandings and achievement of the outline goals. Questions will be a mix of quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data examples include visitor demographics; the amount of time spent at the program; have you been to the museum before? Are you a member?;  how would you rate the quality of the program? (Likert scale: very poor to very good); how would you rate the overall experience? (Likert scale: very poor to very good); I will tell my friends and family about this event (Likert scale: disagree to agree); and, true or false questions about exhibit and program messages, specifically visitors comprehension of the desired understandingsmarble playing was a huge part of American culture from the 1920s through the 1960s, and reflects the social and cultural landscape of the period; marble playing was a pastime that crossed economic classmarbles were played by rich and poor alike; marble playing taught sportsmanship, sparked creativity, instilled problem solving skills, and developed manual dexterity; and, participation in the VFW marble tournaments provided many boys with experiences and opportunities that they would not have otherwise gotten and had a long-lasting impact on their livesQualitative data gathered in open ended questions will include what did you enjoy most about the program?; what did you like least about the program?; is there anything you wanted to know that the program did not answer?; and, what would you change about the program?Museum staff will also track the amount of earned media and reported feedback from staff and volunteer interactions with visitors during events. All of these methods combined will provide an accurate depiction of the effectiveness of the summer program series. The information will be used to inform the design, execution, and promotion of future programs.","The museum asks all visitors for zip code data at the admission desk to determine how many visitors come from the museum's neighborhood or across the United States and the world. Museum staff, along with the assistance of a summer evaluation intern, will develop an evaluation program, which will include gathering visitor demographics (for example, age, number of people in their party, and hometown) and comments. The interns hired for Little Adventures will conduct surveys during the programs that ask for visitor feedback on the tour, hands-on activity, and learning objectives as well as visitor demographics and how they heard about the event. Volunteers and staff will execute interviews, developed by the evaluation intern and T/m staff, during the Kansas City Marble Tournament and Farewell to Summer Free Day. The interviews will ask what prompted their visit, where they are visiting from, if it is their first time at the museum, and their opinions on the event. The evaluation intern will analyze and deliver the results of the interview and survey findings in a written report and presentation at the end of the summer. The 2017 evaluation results have informed the development of 2018s summer programming series; the survey results from the 2018 series will help T/m gauge the success of the programs and better understand how to appeal to future visitors.","POINT (-94.58286200000002 39.03123800000001)","39.0307789 -94.5820049"

Thanks to visitors who nominate and our being connected with CVB we have been nominated for numerous Visitors Choice Awards and we cross-promote via Visit KC every year on their calendar, where the Festival is listed as a Major Annual Event.. We communicate with the Southmoreland Inn and area hotels including the InterContinental, Holiday Inn Country Club Plaza, and Marriott to make them aware of our schedule and to create cross-promotional opportunities. Promotional materials are distributed throughout Kansas City's major neighborhoods, and materials are provided to information desks at major Kansas City landmarks. We frequently update our event listings on KC Studio's online calendar as well as on KC Metropolis. Area restaurants, businesses, family attractions and theatres donate to our on-site raffle, which is promoted to our audience throughout the entire production run. Raffle prizes promote business for 45-50 local restaurants, stores, and arts organizations. The raffle announcements in the park, as well as our website listings, highlight and promote local businesses and attract new patrons to surrounding neighborhoods. A member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association, the Festival's shows are included in issues of Quarto magazine, which reaches an international audience of theatre professionals, educators, and patrons. Should the Festival receive NTDF funding this year, we plan to utilize promotional opportunities provided through the Office of Culture and Creative Services, including the listings on the Streetcar kiosks.","The Southmoreland Neighborhood Association has provided volunteers in the park for many years. We are working with the group again this year to plan a special event in the park during the production run, which will be hosted by the Association.","Live professional theatre, particularly Shakespeare, is not available in every area of the country, which makes the Festival a special experience. Visitors, tourists and business travelers seek low-cost entertainment options. The Festival is directly across the street from a major Kansas City attraction for tourism, the Nelson-Atkins Art Museum. The location of the park in proximity to the many hotels located on or near the Plaza makes the Festival a ready option for out-of-town visitors. Travelers who attend Shakespeare Festivals across the country are enticed by Kansas Citys central location and the fact that our Festival is FREE. They attend festivals to enjoy a variety of plays in various settings. Our beautiful park and FREE admission make our Festival attractive to audience members who make Shakespeare festivals a destination.","The Festival is in a central location and easily accessible by car, bus, or foot. It is in a beautiful park in the mid-town arts corridor where attendees can view art prior to the performance and near the Plaza where they can shop and dine pre-show. The Festival is a family-friendly event, giving an opportunity to spend an entire evening outdoors, with a variety of entertainment and educational options culminating with a professional Shakespeare production. The Festival is the ONLY FREE professional theatre in the city. Kansas City residents will have the opportunity to see our 26th season in Southmoreland Park this upcoming summer. Many people who attend the production mention the Festival as a cultural gem in the community, and that its an annual experience they hope never goes away.  The Festival holds an indelible place in the Kansas City community. The Festival has developed several relationships with arts organizations in Kansas City and will invite all of our collaborative partners to the park, which will also generate interest among audiences who have never been to Southmoreland Park but who patron other arts organizations and community events in the area.","We will acknowledge the Southmoreland Neighborhood Association in our printed program, from our stage, and on our website. We will also provide increased recognition in our social media campaign and in our e-blasts about the special Southmoreland Park neighborhood night in the park. As it is our 26th year being in the Southmoreland neighborhood, we also plan on acknowledging this partnership in our social media efforts during the Festival.","The Festival has set a goal to reach a total of 48,000 individuals through our year-round 26th season programs, with the goal to reach 28,000 through the production in Southmoreland Park. This past summer we had record-breaking attendance numbers, totaling over 28,000 people. The staff is able to assess our performance based on the attendance numbers at the Festival, participation in the park at our ancillary activities, and the audience input each night as they leave the park and share their views verbally and by their responses written on our surveys. While surveys provide key demographic information, they also reveal overall effectiveness of HASF programming through written audience response. This qualitative feedback is integral in understanding our audiences experiences as well as their satisfaction with the quality of the Festival as an event and of the production itself. This year the Festival offered an electronic survey, and we gathered more responses to the Festival production in the park than ever before. Year after year, attendees mention the atmosphere, community, accessibility and FREE admission to high quality performances as the things they most like about the Festival. This years responses included: ""it brings the best of KC  actors, crew, and audience"", ""the entire experience of the Festival is something we look forward to each and every year"", ""we love experiencing live theatre to add to the cultural experience with our family"", ""I love the fact that it didn't cost anything and I still had a first rate experience"", ""live Shakespeare is always a magical experience for us every year"", ""the sense of community, the ambiance, and the venue are awesome, and it is free, public theatre in the outdoors"", 'KC is fortunate to have the Shakespeare Festival, and the experience was so beautiful that the memory of it will long shimmer and linger and no doubt carry me toward a better day"".","The Festival utilizes both a written and electronic survey that is distributed to a diverse group of Festival audience members in Southmoreland Park. The results of the survey help determine future programming and assist the Festival in improving its operations. In our 2016 and 2017 seasons, we collected email addresses in the park and distributed an electronic survey the following morning. We also included the survey link in our social media campaign (Twitter) and in e-blasts sent to our mailing list prior to, during, and after the production run. This method of data collection yielded a greater number of survey responses, which included questions about geographic location, age, ethnicity, income, and education. The survey responses well represented audience members who attended from outside of the Kansas City, MO area. Through the surveys, we were able to determine that 57% of our audience lives outside Jackson County, with 14% of that group living outside the Kansas City metropolitan area altogether.","POINT (-94.582315 39.042145)","39.0440116 -94.5822253"

We are driven by a vision of a diverse community united by dance to inspire and change lives.EDUCATORWe teach 25,000 underserved youth annually through 11 year-round education programs, including two summer AileyCamps in partnership with the Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas school districts; in-school interactive demonstrations and workshops; theater performances; and free jazz, modern, ballet and tap classes at our David T. Beals, III Studio. Our youth development programs change lives for at-risk children by teaching them the pursuit of academic excellence, smart lifestyle choices, fitness, self-discipline, and positive self-esteem. Children in our programs are predominantly African American or Black, followed by Caucasian, Hispanic, Multiethnic, and Asian.FACILITATORWe host an annual Symposium that brings together local and national experts in the arts to discuss issues of race, place, and diversity, and their influences on the culture and future of Kansas City. The event also showcases multicultural partnerships, using KCFAA as a national model. The goal of Symposium is to cultivate a more inclusive Kansas City community by helping participants explore and understand different perspectives. Our 2016 Symposium was held on Thursday, November 10th at the Gem Theater in the 18th and Vine Jazz District. The Symposium featured panelists Randall Jenson, gay, multiracial artist of color and Creator and Director of Social Scope Productions; Dr. Sofia Kahn, founder of the Kansas City chapter of Muslim Youth of North America and refugee activist, founder of KC for Refugees; Natasha Ria ElScari, writer, Cave Canem fellow, 2016 Ragdale Residency recipient, and educator; Dianne Smith, Ph.D., UMKC Professor Emeritus in urban education and social justice studies; and Michelle T. Johnson, writer, public speaker, and diversity consultant. We impacted 298 participants in 2016.PRESENTERKCFAA is New York-based Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater's only second home. We support the work, vision, and sustainability of Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation through annual residencies, new work commissions, and general efforts to advance the legacy of Alvin Ailey. Our 2016 residency performances attracted a diverse audience of 1,675 to three public performances and reached 2,816 students from 32 schools through four school performances.","Kansas City Friends of Alvin Ailey (KCFAA) will employ a two-pronged approach to market the school presentations and public performance. First, KCFAA will contact partner schools to inquire about presenting Ailey Trio to their students. Our partner schools are defined as those that participate in one or more of our 11 education programs. We will also contact schools who have not enrolled in one of our programs to inquire about their interest in presenting Ailey Trio to their students. Secondly, KCFAA will collaborate with VisitKC, the KCMO Office of Cultural and Creative Services, and ArtsKC to promote the free Ailey Trio public performance. We will work to be included in social media posts, digital and print publications, and/or on the event calendars of each of these partners. The combined reach of our partners across these various platforms will allow us to tap into a diverse cross-section of the community, both inside and outside of Kansas City. In particular, we have worked with the Office of Cultural and Creative services to garner promotional placement on the digital kiosks at every streetcar stop and around the city. We will use this outlet again to promote the Ailey Trio. We will also use our relationships with traditional media outlets such as KRPS Hotz 103.3 Jamz, the Independent, KC Studio Magazine, the Call, KC Star, Outfront Media, and local broadcast stations to secure promotional placement on radio, billboards, and local news coverage.",,"KCFAA has a broad appeal throughout the metropolitan and Midwestern region. Ailey Trio provides families and visitors from near and far an opportunity to see performance excerpts from an internationally acclaimed dance company. Ailey Trio also offers tourists and visitors a chance to explore the Historic 18th and Vine Jazz District.","Ailey Trio is attractive to residents because it offers them a chance to experience a series of performances by three premier dancers from Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Residents will also be able to explore the surrounding Historic 18th and Vine Jazz District before and after the public performance. In presenting the Ailey Trio we are encouraging residents to have unique experiences that deepen their ties to Kansas City and in the community.We are also encouraging residents to cross geographic and socioeconomic borders that might otherwise deter them from discovering a new and exciting part of town. Events like Ailey Trio add to the perception that Kansas City is an attractive community with a wide array of cultural offerings for people from any and all backgrounds. We are increasing the citys livability by adding an important element of diversity to our cultural and arts community.","The Ailey Trio will promote the Historic 18th and Vine Jazz District and surrounding neighborhoods as desirable places to live, work, play, and stay. Presenting the Ailey Trio is part of our year-round arts programming, and highlights the importance of our local neighborhoods and their capability to present national artists. Guests spend an average of $47 each in addition to the cost of their tickets at local restaurants and retailers. This will have a positive economic impact on the Jazz District and surrounding neighborhoods.","We will deem the event successful if we meet our planning timeline and ticket sales goal. We will also consider audience satisfaction based on survey responses and the economic impact the event generates. All feedback and numbers will be compared to 2018 results as a baseline.","Although the performance is free, we request that all attendees complete a basic registration form. We administer a post-performance audience survey to all individuals who purchased tickets to the Ailey Trio public performance.. The survey is sent by email to each individual attendee, using Survey Monkey to capture and analyze results. The survey consists of questions about the quality of the performance/event, how the ticket purchaser learned of the event, and demographic information. Survey results are anonymous.",,

This premiere performance of ballet, modern, and contemporary dance is the fifteenth annual concert presented by the company, and promises to be the best yet! Featuring entirely new choreography by Artistic Director Leigh Murray and Rehearsal Director Katie Metzger, the 2018 Fall Concert is partially a narrative story of love and heartbreak. This illuminating story is told strictly through music and movement, keeping audiences invested in the characters, and challenging their way of thinking when it comes to dance and expression. The second portion of the show explores passion and all of its facets. In a multimedia presentation that includes live dance, spoken word, video, and lighting and sound manipulation, KC Contemporary Dance displays many manifestations of passion and how it is perceived by others. The production makes audiences answer certain questions for themselves--why do I live the way that I do? How does passion show in my everyday life? How is my life affected when my passion is neglected? What do I do to pursue my passion in the face of adversity? By reaching into the minds of the audience members and asking these questions, the dancers become relatable representations of audience views, as well as offering a different perspective through their performance. The 2018 Fall Repertory Concert features eleven dancers from Kansas City and across the country that have come together to create this compilation of exciting new work. Utilizing lighting and sound design by Kansas City&#39;s own Redshift Lighting, and multimedia production elements like dance on film by local artists, Kansas City will be (literally) on display in this show. The parameters of &#34;contemporary dance&#34; are highly debated in the performing arts community, but KC Contemporary Dance Artistic Staff regards the term as &#34;a dance style stemming from the current cultures and arts ecosystems existing in the world&#34;. With Kansas City&#39;s vibrant arts culture and expansive styles of arts in all forms, KC Contemporary Dance has created this elite display of aesthetics and athletics in the &#34;contemporary dance&#34; style to highlight the current styles and movement trends of dance across the globe.","4","4","City Stage, Union Station KC","30 W Pershing Rd.","64018","Industry/press preview will be held at the Bauer Event Space, 115 W 18th St., Kansas City, MO 64108All performances held at City Stage, Union Station, 30 W Pershing Rd., Kansas City, MO 64108Possible touring or extended performance opportunities available in the future.","Cultural","The Fall Repertory Concert will be held at Union Station&#39;s City Stage in District 4, in the Crown Center Neighborhood of Kansas City, MO.","700","50","Annual","5590","2096","2096","180736","KC Contemporary Dance is a professional non-profit dance company based in Kansas City, MO, presenting high-quality dance performances in Kansas City and across the Midwest region. The company creates new work through the Artistic Director&#39;s innovation and collaboration, and is committed to the continued experimentation of movement and choreography. KC Contemporary Dance places great emphasis on community outreach and arts education by providing low cost programs to local organizations. In the 2018 season, KC Contemporary Dance strives to make the performing arts accessible to all through outreach and educational programs.","KC Contemporary Dance plans to implement a multi-faceted marketing plan to promote our Fall Repertory Concert. This season, the plan is rooted in the idea of &#34;here/near/far&#34;, meaning that we plan to target three markets-- our local supporters, new local/regional audiences, and farther reaching promotions to out of state patrons. In past years, we have made and cultivated connections with many organizations in downtown KC and the Crossroads area that have been immensely helpful in marketing our performances.  These &#34;friends&#34; of ours are an integral part of our promotion plan, and often participate in things like ticket giveaways, sponsorships, and reciprocal advertising agreements. The Crown Center and Crossroads neighborhood has been good to us over the years, and KC Contemporary Dance in turn promotes the neighborhood along with our event. Based on audience tracking from past years, the &#34;near&#34; market is our most successful and will receive the most attention in regards to marketing and promotions. By utilizing tools like Visit KC and similar events calendars, KC Contemporary Dance staff is able to target certain events in the downtown area at which to promote our performance. Some events are a futile effort, such as ones that include many people traveling for work, or events focused on a field that is not related to the arts or our company&#39;s message. Others provide a good platform for KC Contemporary Dance to advertise (as allowed) our upcoming events to those that may never know about them otherwise. The company&#39;s administrative staff also uses tracking information to target events that feature our most popular demographics, such as conventions for dancers and dance students, events for women, and events for those that place and emphasis on fitness. A few examples are: ticket giveaway at a local/regional dance competition, Just for Her convention held in Overland Park, KS, and handing out marketing materials at a &#34;Yoga and Beer&#34; event in the Crossroads area.",,"This aspect of marketing falls into the &#34;far&#34; category of the &#34;here/near/far&#34; marketing platform. The 2018 Fall Repertory Concert represents the arts community in Kansas City very well, and would appeal to people of all ages and interests that may be visiting during early November. While this performance alone may not get people in the car and on the road to Kansas City, promoting the show in conjunction with promotion of other events and highlighting all that the city has to offer will be a more successful venture. As stated earlier, Kansas City&#39;s landscape plays a huge role in this concert, and KC Contemporary Dance is proud to promote our home city in conjunction with our event. This also allows the company a way to advertise events for our partners and sponsors, as well as reciprocally promote with organizations in the Crossroads area. The Kansas City arts community can help each other greatly by cross-promoting, as everyone&#39;s networks vary.","The arts are important to Kansas Citians, as evidenced by the recent growth in arts organizations and display/performance opportunities for artists of all types. Because of the high turnout of attendees at other similar art shows and KC Contemporary Dance performances, we are certain this show will garner the same appeal. Further, the topic of the show is relatable to many. Love and heartbreak, loneliness, bitterness and spite--these are all feelings that people have throughout their lives, but may have never seen embodied in movement. Passion is a broad term that can mean many different things to different people. People feel passionately driven to change things, passionately invested in their families and careers, passionately determined to prove someone wrong, etc. Many Kansas Citians have passionate feelings about the current state of social and economical affairs, but do not know how to make their voices heard. While this performance may not provide them a direct answer, we are confident the messaging will resonate well with our Kansas City neighbors. KC Contemporary Dance presents high quality work and puts great consideration into artistic quality, aesthetics and athleticism in dance. The company is comprised of highly trained and qualified dancers and choreographers with excellent credentials in artistic endeavors. The artistic and administrative staff is held in high regard within their community, and the work produced over the past few seasons speaks for itself in terms of innovation and excellence. The Kansas City arts community has been nothing but nurturing over the past fifteen seasons, and KC Contemporary Dance shows their appreciation by continuing to enrich the cultural landscape of the city through new works. Kansas City&#39;s arts lovers will be very excited about this show!","As a local dance company featuring many local dancers and choreographers, the show inherently represents the community and the neighborhood&#39;s artistic spirit by featuring its constituents. While funding for the arts has declined nationally, the Crossroads neighborhood and its members regularly support the cultivation of the arts through a variety of mediums. These include providing studio and performance spaces at low or no cost to artists, hosting the First Friday Arts Festival most months, and providing a safe and collaborative atmosphere for artistic collaboration. Attendance at local events is high and we expand the number of people reached with each performance. KC Contemporary Dance is based in the Crossroads area of Kansas City, rehearsing in the Bauer building, performing regularly at First Fridays, partnering with organizations like Visit KC, ArtsKC, and the Weinberger Fine Arts Group. The company has found a welcoming and supportive family in that neighborhood, and hopes to enrich the neighborhood with vibrant and exciting dance events for many years to come. With Union Station as a gorgeous landmark location, KC Contemporary Dance will happily and proudly promote arts, commerce, and tourism in the downtown and Crossroads area in any way possible.","Similar to the demographic tracking measures outlined above, KC Contemporary Dance uses a multi-tired evaluation system to rate the success of each project and the season as a whole. The paper and online surveys provide responses to general questions, such as opinions on the length of the performance, whether audiences would attend or recommend to a friend, and areas of improvement for the future. It is a gamble for the artistic staff to place a lot of weight on the opinions expressed in these surveys, as many patrons are not educated dance viewers, and a lot of opinions differ. All feedback is welcomed and noted by staff. Another method of garnering feedback on artistic quality is through the press and educated dance viewers and reviewers. KC Contemporary Dance invites many dancer reviewers from local media sources to attend both rehearsal and the live performances and write reviews on the content. The company also offers an &#34;industry preview&#34; to other professionals in the field, including professional dancers, company directors, teachers, and university dance personnel. This is a great way to get feedback from those that produce or perform similar works and learn from others at the top of the industry. A very important aspect of measuring the artistic success of a project is the opinions of those directly involved, meaning the Artistic Director, choreographers, stage production team, and dancers themselves. The company as a whole learns a lot from each performance, and the artistic excellence of the company is elevated in each new show. There are other measures of success to consider besides artistic excellence. One is financial success. As a nonprofit company, KC Contemporary Dance has to balance its calendar with &#34;financially successful&#34; events, outreach events, and exposure events. All are successful in their own regard, and are necessary for the company to continue to fulfill its mission. For example, our ticketed performances that earn a solid profit margin are deemed &#34;financially successful&#34;, and make it possible to put on performances like the First Friday shows, that provide great exposure but are free, donation-based shows that do not always out-earn what they cost to produce. Grant funding and applicant cash make these shows and our outreach programming possible as well.","The administrative and front of house staff work hard at each performance to collect accurate data on attendance and demographics for tracking purposes. There are a few different ways that this data is collected. For audience/viewer totals, the front of house staff makes an estimated head count of each performance. Ticketed performances are calculated through estimation as well as reference to ticket receipts. Festivals and performances produced by other companies are calculated by their tracking methods after the event as well as administrate staff estimation at the event. More specific demographics are tracked via payment receipts, for example: senior citizens, students, youth tickets, etc. Another tracking method is the paper audience survey given to each patron at every performance. These surveys provide demographic information provided at the discretion of the patron. While this is a good way to categorize audiences, these surveys are only returned by approximately 35% of patrons. KC Contemporary Dance also utilizes an online survey (to those that provide contact information) that garners marginally better results. This survey is comprised of similar demographic questions, is sent out within a week of the event, and historically garners about a 55% response. For classes and workshops, KC Contemporary Dance requests a form that includes questions about participant demographics, dance experience, goals, and more. These are usually completed by all, but with demographic information provided only at the discretion of the participant. In some cases, these participants are minors and the demographic information is omitted altogether.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853299 -94.5855766"

Theatre for Young America (TYA) began in 1974 at the Waldo Astoria Dinner Playhouse. In 1977, the troupe became an independent organization and moved to Overland Park, Kansas, where it performed for 17 years in a converted cinema theatre. During this time the organization grew from 4 productions to 6 or 8 per season, added drama classes, summer workshops and summer productions, and outreach workshops in schools. TYA operated in the Mission Center Mall from 1994 to 2003.Today TYA performs on the City Stage at Union Station, the Wonderscope Children's Museum and Avila University. We have worked to create each child's lifelong relationship with theatre. Our ultimate goal, then and now, is to encourage the educational and emotional growth of young people through our arts-based experiences.","Theatre for Young America (TYA) takes up residency in the historic Union Station.  With the fall and winter seasons approaching Union Station has truly marketed itself and successfully become a tourist attraction for all visitors to the city.  As stated briefly earlier, TYA struggles with visibility and coming up with funds for advertisement.  During the holiday season hundreds of thousands of people visit the city with many of them stopping at Union Station for the large volume of activities taking place from October through December.  With the amount of activity going on in the building TYA struggles with maintaining visibility, competing against Union Station activities like the Holiday Train, holiday movies playing on the Extreme Screen, Santa Claus, and the decorations in the Main Hall.  City Stage has recently undergone an upgrade in April 2018, so next season we are planning on having assigned seating. That also makes it easier to book tickets online for out of town travelers and boosts the accessibility of the organization. With increased funding TYA will present the main-stage productions as tourist stops and a destination for the entire family.  During the fall and winter families struggle for activities that all ages can and will enjoy.  Theatre for Young America provides an indoor activity for the very young to the great-grandparents.  We present an alternative to a movie, or an outdoor activity.  Again being located inside Union Station helps with the amount of tourists that visit each year.  TYA hopes to gain more tourism through reaching out during the busiest times at Union Station and connecting.  Once that connection is formed with the tourists, in from states like New York, South Carolina, Minnesota, Ohio, and Colorado, we have that bond with a higher chance of repeat theatre goers.  We promote through newspaper advertisement, radio spots, and local parenting magazines (i.e KC Parent).  We often have out-of state patrons attend our shows traveling as far as New York.  Since many patrons are grandparents who visit their grandchildren we have customers who are in town for a short amount of time.  Again since Union Station is such a distinguished tourist attraction we benefit immensely from our prime location in downtown Kansas City.",,"Children's theatre is a popular family activity in the Kansas City metropolitan area and compared to different theatre's we serve a distinct population.  Our clientele has been consistent in attending our shows throughout the companies 40-year history.  Grandmothers who take their children begin to take their grandchildren and so forth. Kansas City is known for its rich, cultural arts venues and we are already an established company.  TYA believes that in opening the young minds of children knowledge of the arts they become lifelong supporters of theatre. One major thing TYA can depend on is our vast expertise in creating patrons that support the arts for the rest of their lives. The arts need support and when a child is exposed to them at an early age the benefits are endless. Even when a theatre student does not grow up to be directly involved in acting, or another area that student will be more likely to take their children to see a play, musical, art exhibit or opera. Theatre for Young America's resident theatre is the H&R Block City Stage in Union Station of Kansas City, a multi-attraction destination site for visitors from Missouri and surrounding states. As a significant component of this site, Theatre for Young America helps draw families who patronize restaurants, hotels, shops and attractions in downtown Kansas City. This activity generates sales tax revenue and business income benefiting the states of Kansas and Missouri. Theatre for Young America is a family-friendly cultural attraction that helps attract new residents to the city, benefiting the local and state-wide economy in many ways. Theatre for Young America makes a major contribution to the education of children in Missouri, and that is a contribution that will have long-term benefits for the state as it faces the unknown challenges of the future. TYA firmly believes that children exposed to theatre at a young age excel throughout their lives and we have seen countless success stories. TYA began as, and continues to be, a professional company with high artistic standards performing for children,a segment of the population often given lip-service but not always actual service of high quality. TYA has been the venue for thousands of children having their first experience of live theatre. These children, growing up, will be the patrons and supporters of many other arts organizations and because they have experienced art of a high quality early on they will be more sophisticated in their appreciation of the arts and will support and encourage a vibrant and progressive arts scene in their community. In its long history TYA has created dozens of original works, introducing children to the whole range of theatrical styles, topics, and dramatic literature. Some of TYA's original plays, especially its social issue plays on sexual abuse and musical plays based on classic children's literature, have been produced across the country, reaching a national audience.","Theatre for Young America, as a 45 year old organization, has a tried and true marketing strategy that ensures each shows success.  Our fall and winter shows always have some of the highest attendance rates of the season and with additional funding our reach would expand even further.  This past fall was an extremely high traffic show which suggests to TYA that fall activities are expanding with more family coming into Kansas City from out-of-town. Our entire 2018-2019 season will help Union Station, located in District 4, maintain a family-friendly group activity during different seasons in Kansas City.  The holiday season is a huge boost to tourism with many new tourists visiting District 4.  As stated earlier, Union Station is a big tourist attraction in itself and many of the activities lean towards families.  During the fall and winter months indoor activities benefit from heavier foot traffic and families can spend the entire day discovering all that Union Station has to offer.  Also the attractions are constantly changing so Theatre for Young America brings in return customers almost every month with a new show.  This means a certain number of guaranteed patrons and families visiting the area.  The registered neighborhood benefits are economic as well.  Because of the success of Union Station and the expansions, including the Streetcar and , the neighborhood is being revitalized.  More and more families drive downtown from the surrounding cities like Shawnee, Overland Park, Prairie Village, Independence, Blue Springs, and more.  The continued resurgence of downtown improves the economic health of the neighborhood with continued progress towards ease of accessibility.  Union Station has been going through renovations ensuring the new and old customer base maintains a high level of enjoyment when visiting.  Parking has been updated, the Planetarium renovated, Science City remolded, and the entrances to the building changed for better access.  These changes help present a family-friendly environment that benefits the neighborhood and tourism.  When Theatre for Young America promotes our performances we always list our location as Union Station at H&R Block City Stage.  Our promotional material  reaches over 200,000 a year.  Since our brand of children's theatre is engaging, educational, and fun we present a platform for children to experience live performances consistently throughout the year while bringing in new patrons to Union Station.","Artistic Director Valerie Mackey selects a season of plays and musicals based primarily on dramatic effectiveness of available play scripts. She decides the season and the scripts after selections are researched  by Director of Education Sheryl Bryant and recommendations are discussed by the TYA Board of Directors, Executive Director and other staff members. One goal of our artistic criteria is to provide a series of seven different, live stage plays that are works of art based on a variety of sources, including ancient folk tales, classic literature, modern literature, social issues, or history. The plays are chosen with plots that are child-centered, often with child protagonists, and with content relevant to the age and development of the young audience. Another artistic criteria is that the full season allows the youngest theatre goers to become more familiar with the art form.The neighborhood and district has become a main attraction for theatre goers with City Stage inside Union Station and the theaters in Crown Center. This creates and promotes the development of the arts. Kansas City is becoming known for being an arts destination and the section of the city, where Union Station is located, is a huge tourist stop. This helps the development and funding of the area and for the continued development of performance. Creating a lasting impression on tourists also creates a lasting memory and helps facilitate travelers for repeat business.","Theatre for Young America uses the same methodology to measure our success each year measuring progress toward the goal of growing our audience TYA uses data from previous seasons, tracking the total number of confirmed reservations as a percentage of the season's final total. By mid November we would be looking to have 50% of the final number confirmed, 70% by March 1, and 88% by mid April.  The youth population of the metropolitan Kansas City area will be culturally, educationally, and emotionally enriched through their experiences with drama education. These young people will become better students, better citizens of their community and better adults as a result of these deeply meaningful and educationally vivid experiences. Numerous parents and former students have volunteered information about the educational, social and vocational benefits of their acting class work. The project fits into our organizational scope and mission by offering young people an opportunity to experience 8 professionally produced plays in varied artistic styles. The three musicals exemplify an established style that utilizes both music and dialogue to tell a story on stage.  Plays that utilize folk tales, science fiction, comedy, drama, contemporary and classic fiction round out the varied tapestry of the project. This introduction of the variety of styles in live theatre fits into our long-range goal of nurturing an appreciative, sophisticated young audience for the art form. The project also seeks to reach a wide age range from 3-year-old children to college age students. Programming includes Early Childhood educational plays and classes, elementary age, middle and high school, and through our relationship with Avila University educational internships for college students. Theatre has been proven to teach children critical thinking and communication skills. Along with these positive attained attributes theatre also helps kids in all areas of their education. Kids who are actively engaged in performing arts are proven to test higher in reading, literature, math, science, and social studies. Children who experience theatre at a young age also can learn languages at a faster pace than children who are not exposed to the arts. Kids that experience arts early in their childhood also learn social skills; including critical thinking and expanding their imaginations. The arts are also important for good health. Researchers have found that cultural activities have helped improve health and lower the risk of depression. Through self-expression children can benefit because they are actively being creative. TYA has helped students develop their ability to visualize, listen attentively, think imaginatively, interpret feelings, and be spontaneous. Theatre for Young America has a powerful and long-term impact on the children it serves.","Theatre for Young America also looks at the data collected through audience reaction polls and surveys to track the satisfaction of our attendees. Through the data gathering process we can determine what shows had a  higher success rate, along with what shows brought in a high financial gain for the organization. In doing this TYA can predict how similar titles will perform onstage next season.Theatre for Young America uses Union Station's ticketing system as well. This keeps track of all the zip-codes of attendees to our performances. We analyze that data to make correct spreadsheets on who attends our shows in each quarter. This gives us an accurate layout of who is attending performances at any given show, date, month and so on.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853282 -94.5855784"

Regional acts as well as national and international touring acts are a part of the festivals spirit, celebrating the variety of music from around the globe. An intricate live video projection installation is a big part of the festival's aesthetic, along with local artist installations. We've managed to grow the festival every single year and have many ambitious ideas for the festival going forward.The concept for Outer Reaches was started in 2012 as KC Psych Fest by Dedric Moore, owner of the recording space HQ and a member of several Kansas City experimental music groups. Originally located at FOKL in Kansas City, Kansas - the festival was moved to recordBar in Kansas City, Missouri in 2014 and changed to the new recordBar location in the Crossroads Art District in 2016. Through the six year of the festival, we have experimented with different formats. It has been both a two and three-day music festival, a single-stage and multiple-stage event, a stand-alone event, and also a concert series. In 2016, we re-branded the festival to Outer Reaches to better encompass all genres of music that are boundary-pushing.Our goal for the annual Outer Reaches 2018 event is to build on the changes that we made for 2017.     We took a big chance and were able to secure several bigger name acts early on, which had the goal of making the festival more easily marketable to a concert crowd as well as potential sponsors.  Although, we were unable to secure any major corporate sponsors, we did very well with local businesses.  Our goal for 2018 is to approach corporate sponsors earlier on in the year for commercial sponsorship.   We have great video, photography, press, and sponsor packets ready to go for early 2018, when major sponsorship budgeting decisions are to be made..   We would like to secure a headlining act each night with a known national / international musician that would excite people.  The goal for 2018 would be to utilize only a single stage, but run the festival over a Friday and Saturday night.   With every Outer Reaches event, live video projection would be a key part to the production, and we'd like to continue to build upon the stage elements built for the video projection installation of our 2017 festival. We would like to utilize the upper mezzanine of recordBar for an installation of visual art to be coordinated with local artist(s).","4","4","recordBar","1520 Grand Blvd","64108",,"Social","Crossroads Art District","400","100","Annual","4000","4000","4000","180272","Midwest Music Foundation unites and empowers the Kansas City area music community by providing health care assistance, education and career development, events and resources.","Outer Reaches aims to bring adventurous boundary-pushing music to Kansas City. We believe that a thriving music scene in Kansas City is essential for the arts in Kansas City. Like our contemporaries in the art, film, and theater world - there is a big market and need for music that is outside of the box, music that challenges a listener. We are focused on musicians that are the outliers in a landscape of Top 40 radio, musicians that are pushing the borders of their respective musical genres and challenging existing conventions. A city that embraces and supports it arts community makes it an appealing place of residence and business for artists.  Outer Reaches will work with the Crossroads Community Association, Visit KC, Kansas City Area Development Council, and other civic development agencies to promote Outer Reaches. We have a great relationship with local press outlets and our promotion campaign generally involves newspaper, printed media, radio, blogs and internet coverage, and a strong social media presence.",,"Kansas City is a great melting pot of culture and art. With the emphasis on boundary-pushing music, we offer an experience not as readily available in smaller Midwest metropolitan areas. The video projection and art installation during the festival provides a more immersive experience than people are accustomed to. We have a very good track record of bringing in musicians from all across the United States to play our festival and have been able to get artists with bigger names every year. People are willing to plan a trip to Kansas City if they get a chance to see an amazing artist that they respect that isn't playing anywhere in their area. We also tend to price the festival at a rate that isn't outrageous, we want everyone to have a chance to participate in our festival by setting a price point that isn't going to force them to make tough personal budgeting decisions.","Music and the arts are a big part of the culture of Kansas City. Outer Reaches aims to provide a familiar experience to the citizens of Kansas City - but with a unique angle, by providing left-of-center music and art. The festival showcases musicians and artists from the Kansas City area, but have also been able to bring in talented musicians from across the whole U.S. and Canada. We would like to push this even further, by being able to bring in some talent from even further away, providing a full world experience.  Generally attendees of our festival discover a new favorite genre of music or a new favorite artist that they wouldn't have otherwise had contact with. With the festival, we hope to appeal to people in Kansas City by offering a unique concert experience they can't get anywhere else.","Crossroads Art District has a long history of supporting creative arts and music in Kansas City. Outer Reaches will continue that tradition. All promotional material will include the Crossroads Art District name. Outer Reaches attracts artists and music fans from all over the entire Kansas City metropolitan area and neighboring communities, and has proven to have some successful at bringing in people from outside of the Kansas and Missouri area. Many of these attendees do not regularly attend events in the Crossroads, so this provides an opportunity to explore and shop in these areas. Outer Reaches has a strong partnership with local businesses to support and promote the festival. Local sponsorship and support generally including record stores, radio stations, merchandise manufacturers, breweries, and not-for-profit organizations such as the Midwest Music Foundation. The recordBar has existing partnerships with area hotels to provide discounts for out-of-town attendees, and we intend to make use of these existing partnerships.","Attendance is the most effective means of evaluating the success of Outer Reaches. We've grown the attendance every year of the six years the festival has been happening. A successful event for us is reaching an attendance goal that we set. An attendance of at least 75% room capacity would reach our goal for the event. There are lots of uneasily quantifiable personal measures of success that the planners of Outer Reaches enjoy every year as well - things like smiles on faces, hearty handshakes, and thank yous.  These are the things that keep us pushing forward with the tremendous amount of work that the festival requires every year.","We have statistics on the zip codes provided by TicketFly for all pre-sale tickets. In our most recent Outer Reaches festival in September 2017, a third of the pre-sale tickets purchased were from areas outside of the Greater Kansas City metropolitan area, including zip codes from Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma, California, Louisiana, and North Dakota. We have plans to implement a mailing list for collecting zip codes from Outer Reaches followers.","POINT (-94.581153 39.095063)","39.095029 -94.5815067"

With the help of an NTDF fund the project will be able to expand into a three show concert series.  The series will be promoted in conjunction with the tourism industry in three key ways.  First, the project will be marketed at the International Folk Alliance Conference in 2018.   The Folk Alliance Conference brought 2,700 attendees from twenty seven countries to Kansas City last year.  The project will have a specific ""Carnaval Showcase Room"" as well as purchase in conference advertising to promote the showcase room.  It aims to expose the national and international music communities to the diverse scene in Kansas City and engage them in Art As Mentorship's community efforts.  The second key way which the project will be promoted is through the Making Movies Carnaval national tour featuring two key artists from the Carnaval lineup.  In March and April Making Movies will embark on a national tour hitting target markets for the project including, Chicago, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington D.C.  The tour will culminate at the Kansas City show, where the show expands into a day long song festival featuring additional national artists.  The third key component is a multi-tiered national marketing campaign.  As Making Movies' star continues to rise, the project will hire long time publicist Elena Rodrigo to quarter back the national publicity campaign.  Having already received national and regional praise, stations including KUTX (Austin, TX), The Current (Minneapolis, MN), KDHX (St. Louis, MO) and CPR (Denver, Colorado), will be leveraged for regional promotion of the Kansas City concert series.  Pointed social media campaigns will be coordinated with the national talent brought in for both Carnaval and the Art As Mentorship official showcase in order to entice fans of these artists from other cities to travel to Kansas City.  Art As Mentorship has already partnered with national ad agency Barkley to create marketing pieces for the program to help expose the project to audiences inside and outside of Kansas City through their #KCLoves platform.  In the past years, Making Movies Carnaval has featured ten national artists that travel to Kansas City for the show, eight of which had never visited Kansas City previously. These artists, like Ozomatli (Grammy Winners and US State Department's Official Cultural Ambassadors), Hurray For the Riff Raff, have substantial national followings which attracted audience members from surrounding cities to travel for the one time only event.",,"The Carnaval Concert series is bringing acts to Kansas City with national audiences.  By doing so, the series gets access to their social media channels and email lists, exposing people from all over the nation about the concert series.  For example, when the Carnaval concert brought Hurray for the Riff Raff in for their first visit to Kansas City, she was already a critical darling nationally.  Fans of her music drove from St. Louis, Lawrence, Wichita and Omaha to see her first performance in Kansas City.  In the past the one day Carnaval concert has also featured regional acts from surrounding cities like Los Parranderos from Des Moines, Iowa.  The scope and prestige of this concert excited Los Parranderos, so when they came to Kansas City for the first time to perform at Making Movies Carnaval, they brought with them a caravan of Des Moines fans to watch their local heroes perform with multiple Grammy winners Ozomatli.  The Making Movies Carnaval Concert has already created a network of relationships with regional and local media, regional and local community organizations.  If the NTDF grant is awarded, allowing us to expand the event into a concert series, more resources can be allocated to growing the regional reach of the marketing.   A full time publicist will be employed to reach out to regional and national media about the entire series.  Also, Art As Mentorship's staff will be tracking the reach of the multi-tiered marketing campaign for the series. Carnaval Concert had a past peak attendance of 750 people with the Concert expanding into a three show series, we feel we can grow the reach to 2,000 people in the first year of receiving the grant and become a cash positive series.  The access to marketing funds and having the resources to continue to bring world class talent to Kansas City will accelerate the growth of the series and keep the series cash positive.  We project that in three years, the regional and national reputation of the concert series will grow to into a self-sustainable model that is no longer reliant on grant funding.  This injection of funds is of great importance in this crucial turning point in Enrique Chi's career as an artist, community activist-as a founder of Art As Mentorship, give an overall boost to the Carnaval brand.  The momentum is already moving quickly for all the projects and this is the perfect time to grow the projects from local favorites into nationally respected, world class thus becoming a pivotal part of the fabric of Kansas City arts.  As evidence of this momentum, on October 12th, the city of Kansas City presented Enrique Chi and Making Movies with an official proclamation congratulation for their work in the arts and celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month.","For Kansas City locals that enjoy live music, they will be thrilled to see our Carnaval line up.  Year after year, we have brought in artists that have never played a live show in Kansas City before.  Even the larger music festivals in Kansas City don't draw our ever-growing eclectic, adventurous locals that are more interested in seeing something new.  Chris Haghirian of Ink Magazine, The Bridge, Boulevardia and Middle of the Map Fest described our Making Movies Carnaval audience as the most diverse audience he has ever seen.  Part of this due to the fact that the national talent selected often would have no other reason to bring their talents to Kansas City.  Locally, Making Movies has already built a rapport and loyal support from this audience and will have the ability to draw a whole new group of consumers to the Historic Northeast and Northeast Industrial neighborhood.  Integrating local youth talent not only provides a beautiful opportunity for these students to grow in self-confidence and showcase their talents, but it also creates an effective guerrilla marketing team. The students draw an extraordinarily diverse audience from moms and dads, grandmas and grandpas, teachers, neighbors...you name it!  When our local youth performs, their loved ones come out in droves to support them.  Each year select charities including the Guadalupe Center and the Mattie Rhodes Center have been chosen as beneficiaries of the concert.   This outreach excites the philanthropic Kansas City music art and music scene because at the events they see how directly their dollars impact community.  As they see young performers, students from the Art As Mentorship or partnering organizations, it provides a tangible outcome for the community efforts. In other words, their philanthropic dollars have never been so fun to spend.  With the concert expanded into a series, the door is opened to multiple collaborations for each event.  For example, the Midwest Music Foundation and Harmony Project KC are already locked in to participate in the ""I AM ANOTHER YOU EXPERIENCE"" concert and Grupo Atotonilco has been an often collaborator.  When the Carnaval Concert Series secures a nonprofit partner or collaborating organization, it always asks for an email blast to their audiences, expanding the reach of the events.  This not only brings in new locals to the Northeast neighborhood, but it integrates those with people who live within the Northeast community, building stronger community ties.  Making Movies has a very strong following across the Kansas City metro area, the band had the most played single on 90.9 The Bridge this summer and consistent print media coverage.  Their name associated with this project makes a large local fan base loyal to the project as well.  Their deep community ties makes others want to get involved and be a part of it.","Since all three of the events will feature musical performances from artists with national followings, the events will draw people from diverse areas into the neighborhoods.  Also, the multi-tiered marketing campaign will expose the neighborhoods to local regional and national audiences.  If awarded with this grant, the project will be able to invest in billboard advertising for the series.  Targeted Billboard ads around the Kansas City Metro Area will promote the neighborhood to new audiences.  Key media partners will be leveraged for exposure of these neighborhood events.  90.9 the Bridge has already agreed to be a media sponsor for the series.  Their support of Making Movies is exceptional, the band's single, Spinning Out was the song most spins on The Bridge this summer.  We are also already discussing editorial coverage from the Kansas City Star about the series.  The event will showcase the great music venue that Kansas City has in Knuckleheads. Since the marketing and community impact of this event reaches far wider than Knuckleheads core audience, there will be a large first time visitors to the Northeast Industrial District.   This past September, Chi curated a Carnaval showcase at the Crossroads Music Festival in order to market the project to a broader Kansas City base.  If granted an NTDF grant so that the project can grow in scope, more creative marketing partnerships like that will be created.  Lastly, with the concert expanded into a series it opens the door to partnerships with different non-profit organization.  The ""I AM ANOTHER YOU EXPERIENCE"" show is in partnership with the Harmony Project and the Midwest Music Foundation.  When partnering with these organizations we leverage exposure in during our events for access to their social media channels and email lists to market our events to their supporters.  This helps unite the Kansas City philanthropic and artistic community at large and brings more people into the Historic Northeast and Northeast Industrial neighborhoods.","The effectiveness of the project will be measured in three key ways. The first growth of the audience not only in size but in diversity.  This will be tracked not only by ticket sales but by patrons added to the email list and a study of their demographics.   The second way growth will be measured is in the amount of dollars raised for the Art As Mentorship program.   In the past the program was already successful in providing a performance opportunity along side professional artists and in bringing community together but was only breaking even financially.  The event has grown organically.   Six years ago, Enrique Chi and his band mates created the Mattie Rhodes Rocks music camp as an act of service to the youth in the Historic Northeast.  The camp is held at the Mattie Rhodes Center and invited the surrounding community to participate.  Through grant funding and private fundraising, the camp is able provided at a very low cost for families.  At the end of the camp, all the students are given the opportunity to perform a concert.  Due to its location in the Northeast Industrial District just a few miles from the camp, Knuckleheads became the location of this rock n' roll end of camp recital.  Three years ago, that recital evolved into the all day music festival Making Movies Carnaval.  After six years of running the camp in service to the Historic Northeast, and specifically the Indian Mound neighborhood, Enrique Chi has launched Art As Mentorship as a way to expand the core principles of the camp into a year-long program.  The program will launch in January of 2018 and the Carnaval Concert Series will serve as extension of the programs impact into the Historic Northeast.  For its first three years, Making Movies Carnaval basically was able to break even and raise a few hundred dollars for the partnering organizations of the music camp.  The biggest measure of success for the launch of this concert series, is if the additional marketing, and access to more nationally recognized artists, will allow the series to successfully fundraise for Art As Mentorship.  The organization aims to run on a $100,000 budget for a year long intensive music education program servicing inner-city youth and focusing on young songwriters.  Being able to raise a fifth of the program's budget is the eventual goal for the concert series.  The last way to measure success is in raising the national awareness of the series and programs.  By launching a Carnaval tour in the spring of 2018 and hiring Elena Rodrigo we will aim to engage with not only the latino music media but the mainstream music media as well.  By tracking the amount of regional and national press impressions we can gauge the growth of the program nationally.  Also, Yonas Media will be employed to coordinate the social media campaign for the series and will be hired to track the impressions and demographics of the social media efforts.","The primary method of collecting data will be through fan club ticketing.  Making Movies has brokered a deal with FullScreen Direct a digital platform that allows you to track info for your audience.  With an effective pre-sale campaign, we can log data of every ticket purchaser that purchases a pre-sale ticket.  In the past we have sold 50% of our tickets in advance.  With the additional marketing resources available to us after securing an NTDF grant, we feel we can raise the advance ticket sale to 70% of the overall tickets.  During the concerts, volunteers will be utilized to collect email addresses and demographics information.  This information will integrate directly with FullScreen Direct's database and allow us to populate accurate data for the attendees of the events.  We already have over 2,000 email addresses in the Kansas City area and will be growing that base throughout this concert series.",,"39.1207108 -94.5502572"

In it's 6th year of existence, the 2018 festival will be even more focused on families and providingactivities which engage families from within and outside of local community to have an afternoon of enrichment and fun. Some of the activities include: Recreation Zone, Mainstage Family Entertainment, KidZone, Art Xpressions, Family Fitness, Healthy U, and Community Resources. Whether one is coming into the community or visiting Kansas City, the Free event is in the heart of the city and in a major thoroughfare thru the city (31st street) and will provide a fun-filled afternoon. The event will continue to present representatives from the city as a welcoming and opportunity to talk about Kansas City and the community with families and visitors, along with all that it has to offer. Some of the guests in the past have included State Senator Shalonn ""KiKi"" Curls, Jackson County Legislator Alfred Jordan (2nd DCity Councilmen Jermaine Reed (3rd District) and Lee Barnes (5th District), Community Activist Alvin Brooks, Mayor Sly James, Councilman Scott Wagner (Mayor Pro Tem) and Councilman QuintonLucas. The event is hosted by a local radio personality which included Darron Story of 107.3 in 2017. Our festival has created a following and reputation which attracts tourist into the community. As such we define tourists as visitors who came into the community from outside of it. Our data shows that our participants and visitors come from 63% of the major KC zip codes, or 40 of the 64 zip codes listed. In addition, 71% of the participants are from outside of 64128 where the event is held in the community. These other areas include greater KC, Overland Park, KCKS, Independence, Grandview, Moberly, Raymore, Blue Springs,Bonner Springs, St. Louis, and Raytown. An expansion for the event in 2018 will include three areas: Recreation - Increased family forms of recreation including things like inflatables, low bungy pads, mobile videos,etc;  Entertainment - Regional entertainment, maintaining family entertainment including puppetry, singing, dancing, instrumentalist; Publicity- Increased publicity directly and through partnerships.","4","3","Total Man CDC","3100 E. 31st Street","64128","none","Social","Santa Fe","1200","300","Annual","4790","3497","3799","180272","The mission of Total Man CDC is to create and operate educational, social and economic impact programs that will serve thecommunity and create a better quality of life for the Total Man. We help families in communities live happy and healthier lives byproviding the most impactful, comprehensive, and sustainable programs: Building our community one Total Man at a time. The FallFestival fits directly into the mission as the annual event has become a premiere community event which has impacted over 1500children and adults, provided comprehensive array of services and activities and has become a sustainable annual event withcommunity partners and services that has seen 50% growth year over year. Specifically, the festival has supported the followingprogrammatic areas of the CDC: 1.

The Fall Festival provides enrichment for familiesand tourist thru the fine and performing arts including praise dance, singing, puppetry, instrumentalists, and Art Xpressions, whichincludes local art teachers working with youth on art projects during the festival. 2.

In 2017, we also worked with hotels in the area to provide flyers and information for their guest.  We will further expand this thru VisitKC and directly in 2018.","The neighborhood organization will have 3 roles in the event - 1) Planning team, 2) Featured Speaker at the event to welcome guests to the neighborhood and 3) set up a booth to provide information on the association and neighborhood.","The event will appeal to people who do not live in Kansas City but who may be visiting for several reasons. In addition to the same reasons that a local person would be attracted as note above---The type of event including having fun, recreational and enrichment for the entire family, being a free event and the marketing that will provide exposure to the event, their are several other reasons.  As tourists are defined as visitors who come to a community from outside of it. We have 71% of our guests who come from outside of our immediate zip code of 64128, including representation from Overland Park, KCKS, Independence, Grandview, Moberly, Raymore, Blue Springs,Bonner Springs, St. Louis, and Raytown. The location of the festival will provide access to those in KC for another reason. With the Festival being held on 31st as a thorough fare that provides street access from the I-70 exit through the city to other destinations. It is accessible for those that may be visiting the Plaza, Crown Center or Downtown---within a 10 minute drive. The festival is a tourism attraction which is transient and flexible, so it can be used to extend or create a free, additional aspect to an existing visit. Whether it be to just see the puppet show by StoneLion Puppetry- who is know throughout the State and has followers or to get a free meal. The inflatables and other recreational activities provide visible indications of fun. We will attract some people from outside the community at the festival who are are visitors who were already in the community, attracted by other features, visiting friends and relatives, or for other reasons. The event or festival was not the reason they came to the city but they decide to stop by. Our survey indicates we have guest who come upon the festival passing by---again, 31st as a major street which we block off during the festival enables this incremental traffic. Lastly, we will expand our entertainment to include other Missouri Arts Council entertainers from throughout the state along with other identified regional acts. These entertainers will also generally include a following whether that be family or friends.","The activities will attract residents from other neighborhoods based on the event being family-friendly, free event.   The attraction and appeal are based on three key elements: 1. Thetype of event - We continue to engage and provide a quality, family friendly event. We provide something for the whole family from kids to adults with entertainment (puppet shows), recreation (kid zone, inflatables, fitness demos,golf putting), and resources. We provide some things as with other family festivals, but have also added elements thru feedback and attending other NTDF events that give our community festival unique features, particularly in the urban core....from the bungee jump and rock climbing wall added in 2017 to large inflatables, to child id cards, to golf putting. We intend to expand the recreation elements on this year. 2) Free - We have continued to maintain our festival as totallyfree. All of our activities from the inflatables to the face painting to health screenings are free. We also provide free food which align with our healthy family, healthy community that children and adults receive their choice of a protein (BBQ chicken, pulled chicken or grilled fish) plus two sides. Each of our community resources and tables have giveaways, so a family can walk thru the festival and fill up their bags...the items are ones could be useful to a tourist or to a family home. We have made a conscious decision not to have vendors selling things so as to provide parents a fun-filled afternoon without the worries of buying. Tourists and visitors feel like they receive alot and still can spend money in the city for food and shopping. 3) Public Relations and Marketing - We continue to strive to expand our PR and Marketing. And our reputation continues to be an ongoing resource for us thru word of mouth. However, we through the further implementation of our Public Relations and Marketing campaign, we will reach and appeal to persons living in Kansas City. As mentioned earlier, we now attract to persons throughout KC and the metro. We will continue to expand our marketing to further penetrate the KC market. In addition, we will also utilize local entertainment and youth groups to participate from other neighborhoods thereby attracting their support groups and families.","The Santa Fe Neighborhood Association will be listed on materials as part of the PR and Marketing Campaign. In addition, the collaboration between the two groups has grown and now includes the Annual Community Garden Walk. The mission of the walk is to nurture community, beautify neighborhoods and encourage civic pride throughout the Urban Core of Kansas City.  The Urban Community Garden Walk strives to empower communities, churches and individuals to make real changes in how we live today by rallying our children, families, church members, neighbors, colleagues and community at-large to make changes that translate to living a healthy life to the fullest and inhabiting all of its beauty for generations to come. The walk also promotes a venue to increase the awareness of good health, wellness and nutrition, urban sustainable gardening practices and strengthening neighborhood participation. The walk is a collaboration between Santa Fe Neighborhood Association, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, St. Luke Memorial Church and Total Man CDC. The walk is held the morning of the festival and is tied into the festival as the walk concludes at the address of the festival. This provides another opportunity for serving and promoting the community. The Annual Urban Garden Walk is promoted with the Fall Festival, but is also promoted separately. This enables the festival as well as the garden walk to have additional outreach to groups such as gardeners, walking groups, etc. The Marketing and Media strategy developed for the 2018 Fall Festival will be designed to deliver maximum exposure to sponsors and heightened levels of engagement among the target audience to participate in all facets of the events. Elements of the plan include:  Email blasts to group lists of over 10,000 individuals leading up to the event  Announcement at over 50 Kansas City churches, community meetings and events  Links on Facebook and Twitter pages  Press releases to local area Print Media, Radio and Internet outlets  Promotion of event with local businesses providing goods and services in the target area  On air interviews and community impact radio segments  Direct marketing with 1,200 plus households in the targeted community and prior attendees","We use several tools to provide qualitative and quantitative analysis from primary data collection, informal feedback, and surveys asevaluation tools to measure our event/project effectiveness. These tools are used differently with the various stakeholders indetermining our success. For example with primary data collection/analysis, we use our number of attendees each year as ameasure of our success. Our event has grown each year from 20-50% year over year. We believe the growth comes from thequality of the event, the level of public awareness, and impact on those attending each year. We also use relationships with ourvendors as a measure of success. Evaluating how many of our sponsors return each year and their level of support. Historically, wehave had over 98% retention rate of our sponsors. We also use informal feedback and surveys from those attending. We do a quick3 question survey with our vendors who participate to understand their experience this year, areas of improvement and interest inparticipating the next year. As a wrap up, we engage feedback from the planning team as a measure of self-evaluation. How welldid we do planning the event? Logistics...how smoothly did things go? What can we add to improve the family / customerexperience","Audience data is collected in 3 ways for persons attending the festival (all of the methods are on a volunteer method and self-reporting).1) Zip Codes - All participants are asked their zip codes when entering the festival at the information table. This is asimple method to understand the basic question of where our participants are coming from within Kansas City and outside of thecity. In a quick, 1 question verbal ""survey"", the festival has a higher level of response. In addition, this is the starting point whereparticipants receive a festival bag, information including a festival map, and a festival bracelet which includes a tab for a free meal.2) Contact/ Demographic Information - Participants are incentivized to participant throughout the festival with a ""Passport"". Once thepassport is completed, it can be turned in for drawings to win prizes. The passport includes contact information and is utilized togrow the festival database each year. And each year, this database is sent a promo card for the current year asking them to return.3) Health and Demographic Survey - This information provides demographic information blindly including age, race, and gender.This information is tabulated to provide overall demographic information but does not have names for HIPPA reasons","POINT (-94.546795 39.069648)","39.0699531 -94.5467288"

It has been a tradition to invite student jazz groups from the Kansas City area to play during pre-concert receptions at the museum, and to attend the artist talks that follow. At one time these receptions and talks were open only to season ticket holders; as of the 2016-2017 season these events have been free and open to the public.For the 2018 season, the series has been limited to four concerts and an overarching theme of Big Bands will be an exciting change.

In addition to paid advertising, we partner will other local organizations and businesses to offer ticket giveaways, program advertising and added exposure to a concert audiences and performers alike. Both audiences and performers travel into Kansas City not just from outlying cities, but also across the region. Our loyal audience members have traveled to see us from Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma. Our singing members travel into Kansas City for rehearsals every Monday night from as far as Warrensburg, Peculiar and Clinton, MO. Many of our members participate the the KCWC supper club, where they pick a different locally owned restaurant to meet and socialize with members and friends before each rehearsal. The list of local restaurants we will provide will be of particular use to the supper club.We also intend to collaborate with Neighborhood Associations to invite their members to attend, offer the opportunity to have our small ensemble, Heartsong perform at events where appropriate and include concert information in their newsletters and email blasts.",,"We have seen first hand through our concert attendees that Kansas City Womens Chorus&#39; concerts can be destination events. Our mission of embracing diversity and advocating for social justice, specifically for women, has universal appeal. Entertaining music choices coupled with the musical excellence we strive for, has the potential to draw a wide demographic of music and social justice supporters.","The Kansas City Womens Chorus brings a vital performance choice to the Kansas City area. Any person identifying primarily as female and singing within soprano or alto voice ranges is eligible to audition. We are welcoming of women from all walks of life: straight, gay, trans, married, single. The positivity of our community has transformed singers and audience members alike. The over 100 singers present themselves as LGBTQ allies. In this capacity, we bring voice to a diverse group of women. Our concerts are the culminating events highlighting our rich sound, while unifying and empowering women to shine in the spotlight. We not only seek to entertain but to enlighten and wonder. Our audience can expect musical pieces that challenge by arrangement or content. Even our lighthearted holiday show will be interspersed with poignant and topical subject matter, to encourage audience members to support us in the quest of challenging societys status quo.Each concert features a collaboration between one or more local, mission aligned organizations where we give them table space in the lobby, include them in our intermission announcements and offer a free ad in our program. We feel this directly appeals to the close knit and supportive community that Kansas City and specifically the arts community prides itself on. As the slogan says, we are one Kansas City. We feel very strongly that through collaboration and support of other local organizations it supports and directly aligns with our mission in giving voice to all women.","Each neighborhood will be included in marketing materials, advertising and publicity efforts. In addition, we intend to provide our members and out of town guests with restaurant and hotel lists, encouraging them to support those closest to the performance venues. Due to the late night end times of our concert week, several members rent hotel rooms nearby. These lists will help direct them to support the neighborhood.We are also drawing attention to the important work of organizations within each neighborhood. We will be collecting canned goods at our Central Presbyterian Church venue for their food pantry. We are also sharing information about the neighborhood outreach that St. Mark Hope and Peace Lutheran Church is doing along Troost through our partnership with the Music on Troost event.At our Unsung concert, we will be honoring a local Kansas City Unsung Heroine to shine a light on the positive philanthropic good women in Kansas City are doing for the nation. We feel this could be of regional or national interest.Lastly, we are most proud of the free educational concert that we offer to local middle school children. This will be KCWCs third educational outreach concert. Targeted schools have responded positively to past invitations and one school in particular increased the number of attending students last season from 180 to 315. The fact that KCWC was able to provide this concert for free made a huge difference for KCPS, an urban district with 100% of students qualifying for free lunch. Based on the feedback from students and teachers gathered from 2016-2017 & 2017-2018, KCWC intends to establish this as an ongoing offering each spring.","KCWC validates its existence measuring the following benchmarks consistently:*Ticket Sales* Audience Feedback* Member Surveys* Impact - A Story Telling ProjectWe will replicate the survey process during our 2018/19 season. We will then have accurate comparison data from the prior year to analyze connections between venue choice and audience demographic (specifically long-term versus new audience) as well as identify areas for improvement. Ticket sales for the 2018/19 season will be compared to the past season to determine if our new three-concert season and signature spring offering illustrates a growth trend in audience development. We also actively solicit members of the entertainment media to attend and review our concerts to receive additional professional feedback in order to improve. Furthermore, we evaluate the immediate audience experience prior to concerts (front of house) to determine ways in which to improve.The Artistic Director, Executive Director, as well as the Board of Directors will analyze the collective survey data.  Conclusions will be drawn and information will be given to committees and chorus membership for action on how to improve the overall concert experience.","The Kansas City Womens Chorus is actively using a survey method to receive information regarding our concerts, organizational management, and membership services. Following each performance, the audience is invited to leave immediate feedback (QR-code, website link & hard copy available). Participation rates have been high with 50-60% redemption. Previous surveys have focused on age, gender and production topics. Our upcoming surveys have been updated to include additional demographics information. We also have access to all ticket buyer addresses and buying trends, which we use for strategic planning.KCWC members are surveyed electronically following each concert. All collected data is shared with the board and passed along to staff and committee chairs to determine the best plan of action for each item.

First, the program uses theatre events to encourages Kansas City residents to be tourists in their town by discovering the diversity of cultural, historic, ethnic, and social experiences that Kansas City has to offer in the community every weekend. Second, our ""Get to Know Us"" series is an exciting series for first-time theatregoers and theatre enthusiasts alike. We select works that span all facets of the city's community outreach goals including, cultural, ethnic, educational, social, historical and recreational. By inviting citizens from other cities to see our shows, join our post-show discussions, and come back to visit us, we are creating a hospitable environment that allows people from out of town to feel "" at home"" in Kansas City. As the premier African American theatre company in Kansas City since 2012, we have created a speciality market in the city that attracts a diverse population of Kansas City theatregoers that almost exclusively visit our theater because of the welcoming community atmosphere we have fostered. The main purpose of our project is to provide a theatre experience that acknowledges the rich contributions that African American artists have made to the theater historically while showcasing new and emerging artists that have the promise to be the voices of tomorrow. We employ emerging actors, directors and playwrights in a vocational capacity to teach them important skills about the theatre industry. In a socio-cultural moment when mainstream theater interrogates questions diversity and equity, KCMPT is always inclusive because the world does not have to try"" to be diverse, it already is. From a tourist standpoint. we provide a rare opportunity for visitors from outside of the City or the State to "" get to know"" Kansas City by learning about its theater makers and the history of African American cultural production in Kansas City. Kansas City is home to many African American artists whose works span performing arts to textiles. These untold stories of Kansas City are not only reflected it our plays and performance but in the rich educational environment that we build to teach the community about American history through an African American lens and to bridge communities in the process of witnessing a live performance.","4","4","Just Off Broadway Theatre in Penn Valley Park","3051 Central","64108","Only one location, not applicable.","Cultural","District 4-Penn Valley Park Community","1200","600","Series Of Events","25000","17734","17734","180272","KCMPT creates thought provoking, professional productions that reveal the rich contributions diverse Americans have  made to the theatrical tradition in the United States.  As the premier African American theater company in Kansas City, our primary goal is to explore theatrical works, old and  new, that feature complex stories of African American life as a lens through which we realize our shared humanity. We seek to build coalitions and partnerships across the diversity spectrum that can create bridges that facilitate  opportunities to understand and celebrate our similarities and our differences.Our overarching goal is to create a public sphere where the theatrical contributions of emerging and established African Americans playwrights can be shared in an enriching  community environment. To make diverse, equitable, and inclusive theater experiences that teach, critique, and model a better America. To continue to identify, train, and incubate performing artists, directors, and technicians from historically underserved communities by offering  opportunities to work in  professional theater. To partner and collaborate with intersectional artists across the diversity spectrum who create work that is dedicated to social change.","Our plan to promote our events with the tourism industry is largely social media, web and flyer based. We will explore all events at the Kansas City Convention Center that are seeking conference goer entertainment. We will provide flyers and brochures for Visit KC, the Power and Light district and the Downtown Council of Kansas City. We will also interface with the Central and Waldo branches of the Kansas City library.  We will canvas our  district and will provide ""street teams"" to distribute ""Get to Know Us"" 2 for 1 ticket vouchers to our theater outside major conventions in Downtown Kansas City.  To date we have targeted the following events for outreach: November 2017 - KC Area Development Council Meeting, December 2017 - National Association of Insurance Commissioners meeting, January 2018 - Downtown Council of Kansas City Luncheon, February 2019 - Primed Southern Diabetes Convention, March 2018 - CCCC Annual Convention, April 2018 - Midwestern Environmental Compliance Convention, May 2018-Neighborworks Training Institute Convention.",,"This project will benefit visitors because they will have a rare opportunity to meet artists and audience members from the community. This will allow the visitors to get a true experience of Kansas City hospitality. After each show we invite about guests to meet the director, performers and crew members and to tell us about who they are and to discuss the show.  We have several events during the run of the show where guests are invited to join us for snacks and drinks.  During these events the guest have the opportunity to meet local writers and discuss the show and mingle with the director, performers and crew members and discuss the show, the process, roles and the company. By sharing our city with our visitors through our talent and hospitality, we can share a powerful message about community building in the arts and across regional spaces. We will communicate with our visitors via social media and email alerting them of our performances so that when they return. they can come back to visit newfound friends in a familiar space.","This project will draw community members to become part of their community theatre. Unlike other professional theaters in Kansas City, KCMPT is the anchor company of the Just Off Broadway Theatre which is part of Parks and Recreation Department of Kansas City, MO. We are one of the only theaters in Kansas City that provide apprentice-style education opportunities for community members to learn performance and production for the theater. We also provide programming that showcases historical, contemporary and new productions written by African American playwrights that are of interest to audiences across racial. ethnic, and class lines. Because our location is ""off the beaten path,"" we have to work twice as hard to identify new audience members because we are in a non-traditional space.  According to The Broadway League, a clearinghouse for "" the business, demographics, and economic impact of Broadway theatre throughout North America, (2016) The following information was collected about the Broadway Theatre audience in 2015-2016, ""In the 2015-2016 season, there were a record-breaking 13.3 million admissions to Broadway shows. 63% of those were made by tourists: 45% from the United States (but outside New York City and its suburbs) and 18% from other countries.  Sixty-seven percent of the audiences were female. The average age of the Broadway theatregoer was almost 44 years. Seventy-seven percent of all tickets were purchased by Caucasian theatregoers.  Of theatregoers over 25 years old, 80% had completed college and 40% had earned a graduate degree"".  Broadway statistics provide a general baseline of theater trends that trickle down into regional theater markets. Many theaters in Kansas City are struggling to diversify, however, they never partner with KCMPT because they are seeking funds from state and non-profit organizations to diversify their own theaters.  KCMPT is already diverse and we have less than 10-15% of the budget of the smallest subsidized regional theater in metro Kansas City.  In March of 2017 the company became a 501c3 and we are seeking funding to continue the work we have done over the last 4 years.  Prior to becoming a 501c3, KCMPT was funded by supporters within the community and personal donations to create the work that we do. Everything we have done we have done on our own with donations from our small audience and donor base. We are the only theatre in Kansas City that completely subverts these statistics. Our average theatregoer is 40 years old, African American, educated at the College level and are 60% female 40% male. Moreover, we have cultivated a multiracial audience of Latino/a, Caucasian, and African American patrons.","We will reach out to the  Penn Valley, Valentine, and Roanoke neighborhood associations as well as the Union HiIl, Longfellow Neighborhood groups. We will invite community members to be guests to all of the theater events and provide ""pay what you can"" evenings for the community. We will also provide free tickets for the administrative leadership of those organization in order to help generate word of mouth promotion and community building.","We will use ethnographic methods captured through digital surveys that we circulate to audience members. We will also ask audience members to offer testimonials about their experience that we will capture in a video booth set up in the lobby for our shows. We will obtain video release forms from willing audience members who feel comfortable talking to us about the value of their experiences. With the video release. we will use the videos to reach new audience members in future program publicity and production.","We also plan to use a text survey that will permit the audience to complete a 5 question survey following a link that we text them via  cell phone. In the survey we will ask questions regarding the educational value, cultural and social aspect  of their visit. We will also be able to track audience members  social and cultural experience after the play and post-play social interaction.","POINT (-94.588729 39.070455)","39.0866624 -94.5876541"

Since our beginning in 1974 we have worked to create each child&#39;s lifelong relationship with theatre. Our ultimate goal, then and now, is to encourage the educational and emotional growth of young people through our arts-based experiences.  Children&#39;s theatre is a popular family activity in the Kansas City metropolitan area and compared to different theatre&#39;s we serve a distinct population.

With more funding secured the youth population of the metropolitan Kansas City area will be culturally, educationally, and emotionally enriched through their experiences with drama education.  These young people will become better students, better citizens of their community and better adults as a result of these deeply meaningful and educationally vivid experiences.  There will be a measurable increase in young adult audiences for other performing arts organizations in the metropolitan Kansas City area.

Theatre for Young America (TYA) began in 1974 at the Waldo Astoria Dinner Playhouse. In 1977, the troupe became an independent organization and moved to Overland Park, Kansas, where it performed for 17 years in a converted cinema theatre. During this time the organization grew from 4 productions to 6 or 8 per season, added drama classes, summer workshops and summer productions, and outreach workshops in schools. TYA operated in the Mission Center Mall from 1994 to 2003.Today TYA performs on the City Stage at Union Station, the Wonderscope Children&#39;s Museum and Avila University. We have worked to create each child&#39;s lifelong relationship with theatre. Our ultimate goal, then and now, is to encourage the educational and emotional growth of young people through our arts-based experiences.","Theatre for Young America (TYA) takes up residency in the historic Union Station.  Union Station has truly marketed itself and successfully become a tourist attraction for all visitors to the city. As stated briefly earlier, TYA struggles with visibility and coming up with funds for advertisement. During the time of spring break hundreds of thousands of people visit the city with many of them stopping at Union Station for the large volume of activities taking place during spring break. City Stage has recently undergone an upgrade in April 2018, so this upcoming season we are planning on having assigned seating. That also makes it easier to book tickets online for out of town travelers and boosts the accessibility of the organization. With continued increased funding TYA will present the main-stage productions as tourist stops and a destination for the entire family. Theatre for Young America provides an indoor activity for the very young to the great-grandparents. We present an alternative to a movie, or an outdoor activity. Again being located inside Union Station helps with the amount of tourists that visit each year. TYA hopes to gain more tourism through reaching out during the busiest times at Union Station and connecting. Once that connection is formed with the tourists, in from states like New York, South Carolina, Minnesota, Ohio, and Colorado, we have that bond with a higher chance of repeat theatre goers. We promote through newspaper advertisement, radio spots, and local parenting magazines (i.e KC Parent). We often have out-of state patrons attend our shows traveling as far as New York. Since many patrons are grandparents who visit their grandchildren we have customers who are in town for a short amount of time. Again since Union Station is such a distinguished tourist attraction we benefit immensely from our prime location in downtown Kansas City.",,"Children&#39;s theatre is a popular family activity in the Kansas City metropolitan area and compared to different theatre&#39;s we serve a distinct population. TYA believes that in opening the young minds of children knowledge of the arts they become lifelong supporters of theatre. One major thing TYA can depend on is our vast expertise in creating patrons that support the arts for the rest of their lives. The arts need support and when a child is exposed to them at an early age the benefits are endless. Even when a theatre student does not grow up to be directly involved in acting, or another area that student will be more likely to take their children to see a play, musical, art exhibit or opera. Theatre for Young America&#39;s resident theatre is the H&R Block City Stage in Union Station of Kansas City, a multi-attraction destination site for visitors from Missouri and surrounding states. As a significant component of this site, Theatre for Young America helps draw families who patronize restaurants, hotels, shops and attractions in downtown Kansas City. This activity generates sales tax revenue and business income benefiting the states of Kansas and Missouri. Theatre for Young America is a family-friendly cultural attraction that helps attract new residents to the city, benefiting the local and state-wide economy in many ways. Theatre for Young America makes a major contribution to the education of children in Missouri, and that is a contribution that will have long-term benefits for the state as it faces the unknown challenges of the future. TYA firmly believes that children exposed to theatre at a young age excel throughout their lives and we have seen countless success stories. TYA began as, and continues to be, a professional company with high artistic standards performing for children,a segment of the population often given lip-service but not always actual service of high quality. TYA has been the venue for thousands of children having their first experience of live theatre. These children, growing up, will be the patrons and supporters of many other arts organizations and because they have experienced art of a high quality early on they will be more sophisticated in their appreciation of the arts and will support and encourage a vibrant and progressive arts scene in their community. In its long history TYA has created dozens of original works, introducing children to the whole range of theatrical styles, topics, and dramatic literature. Some of TYA&#39;s original plays, especially its social issue plays on sexual abuse and musical plays based on classic children&#39;s literature, have been produced across the country, reaching a national audience.","Theatre for Young America, as a 45 year old organization, has a tried and true marketing strategy that ensures each shows success. Our spring shows always have some of the highest attendance rates of the season and with additional funding our reach would expand even further. This past spring was an extremely high traffic show which suggests to TYA that spring activities are expanding with more family coming into Kansas City from out-of-town. Our entire 2018-2019 season will help Union Station, located in District 4, maintain a family-friendly group activity during different seasons in Kansas City. As stated earlier, Union Station is a big tourist attraction in itself and many of the activities lean towards families. During the time of spring break indoor activities benefit from heavier foot traffic and families can spend the entire day discovering all that Union Station has to offer since there are a variety of attractions are available. Also the attractions are constantly changing so Theatre for Young America brings in return customers almost every month with a new show. This means a certain number of guaranteed patrons and families visiting the area. The registered neighborhood benefits are economic as well. Because of the success of Union Station and the expansions, including the Streetcar and , the neighborhood is being revitalized. More and more families drive downtown from the surrounding cities like Shawnee, Overland Park, Prairie Village, Independence, Blue Springs, and more. The continued resurgence of downtown improves the economic health of the neighborhood with continued progress towards ease of accessibility. Union Station has been going through renovations ensuring the new and old customer base maintains a high level of enjoyment when visiting. Parking has been updated, the Planetarium renovated, Science City remolded, and the entrances to the building changed for better access. These changes help present a family-friendly environment that benefits the neighborhood and tourism. When Theatre for Young America promotes our performances we always list our location as Union Station at H&R Block City Stage. Our promotional material reaches over 200,000 a year. Since our brand of children&#39;s theatre is engaging, educational, and fun we present a platform for children to experience live performances consistently throughout the year while bringing in new patrons to Union Station.","Artistic Director Valerie Mackey selects a season of plays and musicals based primarily on dramatic effectiveness of available play scripts. She decides the season and the scripts after selections are researched by Director of Education Sheryl Bryant and recommendations are discussed by the TYA Board of Directors, Executive Director and other staff members. One goal of our artistic criteria is to provide a series of seven different, live stage plays that are works of art based on a variety of sources, including ancient folk tales, classic literature, modern literature, social issues, or history. The plays are chosen with plots that are child-centered, often with child protagonists, and with content relevant to the age and development of the young audience. Another artistic criteria is that the full season allows the youngest theatre goers to become more familiar with the art form.The neighborhood and district has become a main attraction for theatre goers with City Stage inside Union Station and the theaters in Crown Center. This creates and promotes the development of the arts. Kansas City is becoming known for being an arts destination and the section of the city, where Union Station is located, is a huge tourist stop. This helps the development and funding of the area and for the continued development of performance. Creating a lasting impression on tourists also creates a lasting memory and helps facilitate travelers for repeat business.","Theatre for Young America uses the same methodology to measure our success each year measuring progress toward the goal of growing our audience TYA uses data from previous seasons, tracking the total number of confirmed reservations as a percentage of the season&#39;s final total. By mid November we would be looking to have 50% of the final number confirmed, 70% by March 1, and 88% by mid April. The youth population of the metropolitan Kansas City area will be culturally, educationally, and emotionally enriched through their experiences with drama education. These young people will become better students, better citizens of their community and better adults as a result of these deeply meaningful and educationally vivid experiences. Numerous parents and former students have volunteered information about the educational, social and vocational benefits of their acting class work. The project fits into our organizational scope and mission by offering young people an opportunity to experience 8 professionally produced plays in varied artistic styles. The three musicals exemplify an established style that utilizes both music and dialogue to tell a story on stage. Plays that utilize folk tales, science fiction, comedy, drama, contemporary and classic fiction round out the varied tapestry of the project. This introduction of the variety of styles in live theatre fits into our long-range goal of nurturing an appreciative, sophisticated young audience for the art form. The project also seeks to reach a wide age range from 3-year-old children to college age students. Programming includes Early Childhood educational plays and classes, elementary age, middle and high school, and through our relationship with Avila University educational internships for college students. Theatre has been proven to teach children critical thinking and communication skills. Along with these positive attained attributes theatre also helps kids in all areas of their education. Kids who are actively engaged in performing arts are proven to test higher in reading, literature, math, science, and social studies. Children who experience theatre at a young age also can learn languages at a faster pace than children who are not exposed to the arts. Kids that experience arts early in their childhood also learn social skills; including critical thinking and expanding their imaginations. The arts are also important for good health. Researchers have found that cultural activities have helped improve health and lower the risk of depression. Through self-expression children can benefit because they are actively being creative. TYA has helped students develop their ability to visualize, listen attentively, think imaginatively, interpret feelings, and be spontaneous. Theatre for Young America has a powerful and long-term impact on the children it serves.","Theatre for Young America also looks at the data collected through audience reaction polls and surveys to track the satisfaction of our attendees. Through the data gathering process we can determine what shows had a higher success rate, along with what shows brought in a high financial gain for the organization. In doing this TYA can predict how similar titles will perform onstage next season. Theatre for Young America uses Union Station&#39;s ticketing system as well. This keeps track of all the zip-codes of attendees to our performances. We analyze that data to make correct spreadsheets on who attends our shows in each quarter. This gives us an accurate layout of who is attending performances at any given show, date, month and so on.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853282 -94.5855784"

The city's recent investments in the upgrades to the roads around our headquarters at 20th and Baltimore, as well as the continued interest in, and usage of, the streetcar line, are exciting reasons to encourage continued participation in M-AAAs First Friday events. M-AAA is also proud of its strong partnership with the Crossroads Community Association (CCA) and its ongoing acknowledgment of the role that M-AAA plays in helping to promote the neighborhood.

No other dance company in Kansas City promotes other choreographers and dancers in a showcase event like City in Motion does with A Modern Night at the Folly.

Also, the Professional Company does community outreach through Kansas City Young Audiences by traveling throughout the year to perform a unique show for the second and third graders at the Kansas City Public Schools.

While the program's primary purpose is to inform the audience member of certain details about the concert and the artists, it also features ads and information about the area in which the venue is located. Throughout the season, ads for these programs are sold to assist with production costs. These ads will often include a coupon or a free treat if the patron visits that establishment and mentions the ad. While many businesses across the Kansas City Metropolitan area place these ads in our programs, we often focus in on the venue location and therefore, the neighborhood receives recognition and promotion.","The success of our event is measured mostly by ticket sales and overall crowd feedback. If our budget revenues and expenditures balance out, we have either met or exceeded our goals. The projected budgets utilize numbers from the previous season and therefore we always hope to meet that same expectation or improve upon those numbers. Audience feedback either through word of mouth or surveys is a great measure of artistic success of the event and overall event execution. Another tool used to measure event effectiveness is media attention, whether that is extra advertising outside of the typical purchased ads or after performance reviews.","It is calculated, based on pre-show tickets sold for A Modern Night at the Folly in past years, that about 25 to 30% of the total attendees are out-of-town tourists. Credit card sales and word-of-mouth from participating artists tell us that we've attracted artists and audience members from across Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania, and it continues to grow. Since the Folly Theater seats 1078, if we are able to attract a full house, we could potentially have at least 300 of those patrons from areas outside of Kansas City, MO. Promotional materials for each concert are designed and printed as save-the-date cards, posters and postcards.

As it does for residents, Festival on the Vine offers visitors an avenue to explore the historic 18th and Vine Jazz District.","Festival on the Vine is attractive to Kansas City, Missouri residents because it offers them a chance to sample a diverse mixture of dance, from hiphop to ballet; see work by national black and multicultural dance companies that would otherwise by unavailable to them; and most excitingly, introduce them to the Historic 18th and Vine Jazz District. By presenting Festival on the Vine, we are encouraging residents to have unique experiences that deepen their ties to Kansas City and the community. We are also encouraging residents to cross geographic and socioeconomic boundaries that might otherwise deter them from discovering a new and exciting part of town. Events like Festival on the Vine add to the perception that Kansas City is an attractive community with a wide array of cultural offerings for people from any and all backgrounds. We are increasing the city's livability by adding an important element of diversity to our cultural and arts community.","The Festival on the Vine helps to promote the 18th and Vine Jazz District and surrounding neighborhoods as a desirable place to live, work, play, and stay. Presenting Festival on the Vine is part of our yearround arts programming and highlights the importance of our local neighborhoods and their capability to present national artists. It is important for NTDF to support Festival on the Vine because we are elevating the Historic 18th and Vine Jazz District as an attractive tourist destination, fostering spending in the district, and showcasing the district's potential for private investment. Ultimately, the increased focus and investment Festival on the Vine generates directly complements the City's investments in the Kansas City Urban Youth Academy and the 18th and Vine Improvement Plan, because we are moving the district toward sustainability.","We will deem the event successful if we meet our planning timeline and ticket sales goal. We will also consider audience satisfaction based on survey responses and the economic impact the event generates. All feedback and numbers will be compared to 2015 and 2016 as baselines.","We administer a post-performance audience survey to all individuals who purchased tickets. The survey is sent by email to each individual ticket purchaser and we use Survey Monkey to capture and analyze results. The survey consists of questions about the quality of the performance/event, how the individual learned of the event, and demographic information.

The NAIAembraces the concept of the student and recognizes the importance of the individuality of each member institution, the value of theconference and regional structure, and the benefits of membership in a national association. The NAIA supports gender equity.Gender equity is an atmosphere and a reality where fair distribution of overall athletic opportunity and resources, proportionate toenrollment, are available to women and men, and where no student-athlete, coach or athletics administrator is discriminated againstin any way in the athletics program. That is to say, an athletics program is gender-equitable when the mens sports program wouldbe pleased to accept as its own the overall participation opportunities and resources currently allocated to the womens sportsprogram and vice versa.","The NAIA has a mission to provide quality sporting events that create a positive and memorable experience for everyone involved in National Championship events. This includes sponsors, businesses, community members, fans, member institutions, and the city atmosphere in which our National Championships are held. Our NAIA Division I Men's Basketball National Championship complies with the tourism industry by being signed off by the KCCVA, along with a member of the KCCVA assisting with our Local Organizing Committee to assist in all marketing and promotion of the event. The Kansas City Sports Commission is also a part of our Local Organizing Committee who also helps with advertising and promotion through their electronic newsletter, ticket links, and teaming up with our staff to put on the FREE basketball youth clinic on the Saturday morning of Family Day. Our sporting event provides direct economic impact to the community while enhancing tourism in the area. We also strive for community ownership by recruiting a diverse volunteer base and mutually beneficial sponsorship relationships.","The KC Convention and Visitors Association has helped in several ways over the years and will continue to do so. They have helped by putting up banners on street poles in downtown, as well as sending out tournament information on their website and social media platforms. In the past they have published an article dedicated to basketball in Kansas City that highlighted the NAIA tradition and historic NAIA Division I Men's Basketball National Championship. We also engaged their service by awarding the KCCVA an Honorary Coach position so that they could receive the full experience of the tournament along side of one of our teams. The other Honorary Coaches are also a group of local business men and women that sponsor each of our 32 teams during their visit to Kansas City for the National Championship tournament. We also recognize the Kansas City Sports Commission by promoting the tournament on their website, recruiting local neighborhood volunteers and promoting tickets to their members. We also are very thankful to the Kansas City Sports Commission for bringing their FREE Youth Series Clinics to our championship. The biggest help we have from our neighborhood organizations is by having over 150 volunteers from the downtown Kansas City area assist in the production and operations of the tournament at Municipal Auditorium. Our volunteers continue to be a valuable resource in running and producing a great National Championship tournament.","The National Championship is promoted within the local hotels and other local businesses and organizations with the flyers, schedule cards, and other promotional materials that are distributed. Also, our partnership with other events and attractions in town spreads the word to anyone visiting the Kansas City Area during this event. Once the teams are selected we outreach to alumni associations, athletics departments, and push travel and attendance from each and every school participating in the championship. Our tournament is highlighted as one of Visit KC's ""Top Things To-Do while in Kansas City"" in March, which is one of the most visited pages for out of town guests during their stay in our great city. Our affordable ticket prices and family friendly environment makes the tournament an attractive option for entertainment to any sport fan visiting from out of town.","The NAIA Division I Men's Basketball National Championship continues to consistently bring in approximately 70% of spectators from the Kansas City residents with the main promotion and business/sponsorship relationships in the Kansas City, Missouri district.

In addition, we bring in Kansas City stars such as Frank White, Mayor Sly James, and local radio stars to be celebrity judges of our slam dunk contest held on Family Day. This is one of the largest attended days of the tournament due to the engaging Shoot & Slam, activities for all kids, and an emcee who brings energy and interactive fan promotions.

Teams will be staying in the downtown Kansas city hotels for an average of five days, with encouragement to eat, tour, and visit local Kansas City businesses and attractions. Economic impact is estimated at more than $2.7 million according to the Greater Kansas City CVA. With the National Championship being held at Municipal Auditorium, it plays a strong role in building the community of downtown Kansas City. The economic impact will be felt annually with this historical event because of its continual increase in attendance, revenue, and promotion. We also push our fans and teams to local partner restaurants that play our games live on their TVs.  The consistent annual visitors produced by this tournament in the downtown Kansas City area will create an increased awareness of improvements that are taking place downtown. In addition, with our NAIA Champions of Character presentations given by our student-athletes throughout the community, this will promote education about positive character traits that are emphasized at our NAIA institutions in partnership with our athletics.","The NAIA Mens Basketball tournament is a Kansas City treasure and certainly an iconic event.

The Folly welcomes all to hear Ms. Adams, and to celebrate the grand re-opening of &#34;Kansas City&#39;s Carnegie Hall&#34;, following the completion of a $2.5 million transformation of the first floor lobbies and Shareholders Room. The exceptional event will benefit the Folly, its programs and the 60,000 people from the metropolitan area, and more than a dozen additional states, who come to this historic theater every year. Perhaps most of all, the concert will assist the Folly in reaching almost 7,000 children this year through the Folly Kids&#39; Series, with the majority being students from Title I schools in the area. Often a Folly Kids&#39; Series performance is the first time a child has been to Downtown Kansas City, to an historic theater, and to a cultural performance targeted to support learning and classroom curriculum goals. A portion of the event&#39;s proceeds will permit the Folly to subsidize Kids&#39; Series tickets and transportation costs for underserved/Title I students. Oleta Adams is a four-time Grammy nominee, with legions of fans around the globe. Her music draws deeply from roots in gospel music, but crosses effortlessly into realms of R&B, jazz, urban and popular music. She was a fixture at the Signboard Bar at Crown Center and many additional jazz clubs in Kansas City, and left the Midwest to join worldwide tours with Tears for Fears, Phil Collins, Michael Bolton and Luther Vandross. It is time to hear her magnificent voice in Kansas City once again. With NTDF support for a creative marketing program around this benefit concert, the Folly leadership plans to promote Kansas City, as well as entertainers like Oleta Adams, whose professional beginnings in our community have led to stellar careers. We anticipate an audience of 1,000 people from the greater metropolitan area, and neighboring states.  All concert proceeds will be invested in the creative and diversified programming that are hallmarks of the Folly Theater.","4","4","Folly Theater","300 W 12th Street","64105","N/A","Cultural","The Downtown Neighborhood-KCMO Association is our registered partner, serving the area where the Folly Theater is located at 12th & Central Streets.","1000","600","One-Time Event","45000","14464","14464","180736","To preserve Kansas City&#39;s oldest historic theater as a premier performance venue, we commit to maintain our building&#39;s heritage, diversify our program and entertainment offerings, and be an enthusiastic participant in the continuing revitalization of Downtown Kansas City.","The Folly Frolic marketing team is viewing this concert event as a regional draw, and is choosing to focus on social, print, radio and outdoor media to entice patrons who may not typically pass through our doors, but remember well the performances of Oleta Adams and are eager to hear her again. Strategically targeted geo-fencing for digital and social media advertising will focus on residents living in Independence, Lee&#39;s Summit, Liberty and St. Joseph, MO, and Overland Park, Leawood, Lenexa, Lawrence and Kansas City, KS. Strong partnerships with VisitKC, the KC Chamber, Hispanic Chamber and Gay & Lesbian Chamber will assist the Folly Theater in promotion of the benefit concert evening to individuals and groups interested in Kansas City events and attractions. With NTDF support, Save-the Date post cards will be mailed to approximately 5,000 recent ticket buyers to Folly Jazz Series and other comparable performances, print flyers will be distributed with Downtown partners such as hotels, restaurants, coffee shops/bars, banks, legal firms, etc. to catch the attention of potential patrons from both in and out of town. The team will work with major radio stations (currently in negotiation with 3 radio partners for promotional packages) to get the attention of Oleta Adams fans in surrounding areas from St. Joseph to Grandview, and Columbia, MO to Topeka, KS. Depending on available marketing and advertising grant support, placement of billboards at the entrances of Kansas City at I-35 and I-70 should capture commuter traffic, and KC Streetcar Line ads will put the concert out to local commuters and tourists. A more detailed Marketing Plan is attached. The Folly&#39;s on-going collaborations and partnerships with local jazz organizations, from J.A.Z.Z. Alive to Jam Magazine and the GEM Theater, offer us organizational contacts to reach varied groups who follow Kansas City jazz, and to build momentum for the concert.",,"Four-time Grammy nominated Oleta Adams has a strong national and international following among jazz, R&B, gospel, and contemporary music patrons. Her stellar artistic reputation should be a strong draw for those outside the metropolitan area. Additional interest in the Folly&#39;s renovations will bring those with affinity with historic preservation, as well as those who have attended events at the Folly since its re-opening in the 1980s and are curious about the updates. Pre-event &#34;human interest&#34; stories about both the artist and the venue should enhance excitement around the event and its appeal to a broad cross-section of audience interests. The Folly will work to draw an audience from the four-state area, patrons who already know the Theater for exceptional jazz programming and unique, dynamic artists. Working in collaboration with Downtown hotels and select businesses, we can extend the concert&#39;s appeal to the visitor and business traveler who wish to experience more of our city.","The historic Folly Theater is a well-known venue in Kansas City, one valued for its intimacy and the quality of sound that underscores a musical performance. Hearing Oleta Adams in concert at this exceptional venue will resonate for many who followed her each week as she performed in Kansas City restaurants and bars. Even more, we anticipate a strong contingency of donors and regular patrons will be eager to see the Folly&#39;s capital improvements and renovations, and will join us in celebrating the completion of this work. We plan to connect to many jazz, blues and gospel fans who will want to hear a memorable concert by a legendary Kansas City performer. We propose using NTDF funding to broaden our marketing base for the event and therefore maximize attendance and results for the historic Folly Theater and its service to our region.","The 2018 Folly Frolic Benefit Concert, with Oleta Adams, will make the Downtown area and neighborhood the focus of attention for outstanding cultural and entertainment options in the month of November. As we also celebrate the grand re-opening of the theater and its improved patron &#34;experience&#34; that evening, we will remind attendees and the extended community of the rich and deep legacy of the Folly in Kansas City&#39;s cultural landscape. The &#34;then-and-now&#34; story of the Folly Theater connects directly to the civic progress and resurgence of interest in Downtown as a residential and vibrant community. Our Downtown neighbors value the Folly for its location, its reputation in the region and nation, and for the wide-ranging diversity in its programming.  Within easy walking distance of hotels, restaurants and bars, the Folly is a natural choice for local residents, and an easily-accessed choice for those in surrounding neighborhoods and staying in Downtown hotels. As the only remaining 19th Century performance venue in Kansas City, the Folly offers a compelling view of the development of early Kansas City, the architecture of the time, and echoes of how our city as a Gateway to the West also was at the forefront of cultural experiences.Events at the Folly always include references to this Kansas City neighborhood as the &#34;cultural crossroads&#34; of our community. The Folly draws almost 60,000 people annually to this part of Kansas City, and presents some of the most ethnically, culturally and socially diverse artists to be seen and heard anywhere in the greater metro area. The 2018 Folly Frolic benefit Concert will find over 1,000 patrons and volunteers in Downtown Kansas City on November 17.","As with any fundraising event, total funds raised and event attendance are key measures of success. Net proceeds from this event will help support the Follys creative programming and operations. One of the Folly&#39;s more important programs is the Folly Kids&#39; Series, which serves over 7,000 area students each year, most of whom attend Title I schools. The Folly applies for grants to help underwrite bus transportation and tickets for several thousand students whose schools could not otherwise afford to send them to the education-enriching productions in the Kids Series. The Folly Theater board and staff are constantly gathering information about audiences and programming in order to make appropriate artistic and event decisions, and to maximize outcomes. We use feedback from ticket buyers, as collected by our box office staff, and the range of professional event reviews (in print and on-line professional commentaries) to assess a concert&#39;s artistic success. The success of ticket sales and responses to invitations to join the event as a sponsor, help us gauge the public&#39;s response to our event, as well as affirm its purpose and overall quality.","Audience demographics will be collected mainly through box office records (zip codes, questions about how the customer chose to attend the event, etc.). In addition, non-scientific audience surveys go out after each Folly event to the ticket buyer, and seek input on the customer&#39;s satisfaction with the quality of the event, the location/parking, and other individual experiences. We rely on the goodwill of patrons to complete these surveys for the sake of improving the concert experience, and to assist the Folly staff in gaining a greater understanding of any issues or problems related to attending the concert. These surveys also ask the recipient to voluntarily provide demographic information concerning their age range and race. In addition, our volunteer usher staff is attentive to the needs of every patron, and is particularly trained to assist with those who have physical disabilities or challenges. These volunteers help gather data on attendees with special needs and offer informal opinion on audience demographics.","POINT (-94.587121 39.100075)","39.1003676 -94.587191"

In 2017, the Birthday Beat series included a total of six programs (one each) about Mongo Santamaria, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Buddy Rich, Thelonious Monk, and Dizzy Gillespie. In 2018, the tradition continues with celebrations of jazz greats including Jay McShann, George Salisbury, and more. Celebrations will be quarterly, with a mini poster exhibition about the honorees and a musical birthday party featuring cake, music, and dancing. In building momentum for Charlie Parker's 100th birthday in 2020, we look to grow our presence within the greater Kansas City landscape of Charlie Parker celebrations in 2019.

In 2017, the Museum featured Musicologist Tammy Kernodle of Miami University in Ohio, lecturing on Charlie Parker, followed by Tivon Pennicott and Sullivan Fortner in the Blue Room. Our aim is to grow the single speaker into a larger panel/mini-symposium led by jazz scholars including Ted Gioia, experts on the Dial Records label, and others. During the week of birthday celebrations, we will also include a student jazz workshop, presented by the Museums Kansas City Jazz Academy and the Elder Statesmen of Kansas City Jazz. We are also currently working with a donor to discuss hosting an exhibit of their private collection, featuring Charlie Parker ephemera and rare albums. This exhibit will provide an expanded look at one of our 4 jazz masters, of the permanent exhibition, which only currently allows for a basic overview of the artist.

There will also be education and community engagement activities in conjunction with the production, including a Student Dress Rehearsal on November 1, 2018. Prior to the Student Dress Rehearsal, which students can attend for the minimal cost of $5 apiece, teachers receive a packet of educational materials to prepare their students for what to expect, to create an entire lesson plan about the opera, and to ensure students gain the most from their experience.  Madama Butterfly will be featured in our At Ease with Opera series and our Opera Previews series.  At Ease with Opera features speakers who give presentations in conjunction with our mainstage productions.  The programs often revolve around an upcoming production, but may also deal with a general topic in the field of opera, offering background and insights into the art form.  Opera Previews are presented one hour before every performance at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.  The previews are entertaining and offer a wealth of background about the composer, context, and history of the opera.  One of the most popular operas ever, Puccinis Madama Butterfly explores the clash of American and Japanese cultures as they unfold on a personal scale with tragic results.  While stationed in Nagasaki, an American naval officer enters into a temporary marriage to the Japanese geisha Cho Cho San (known as Butterfly), following the practice among American sailors of keeping Japanese women as temporary wives.  The officer then returns to the United States, promising to return as he leaves her pregnant with his son.  She remains faithful to him, waiting for three years until he finally returns, accompanied by his American wife, who intends to adopt the child.  Forsaken and abandoned, and following her fathers samurai code of honor, Butterfly commits suicide with her fathers blade.  Madama Butterfly gives audiences the opportunity to explore the relationship between opera and society as it addresses Western attitudes toward other cultures.  Madama Butterfly is set against the backdrop of a large-scale clash of cultures, as the historical force of American imperialism encounters a Japanese society opening to the West.  Puccini was very deliberate in crafting a sound world that evokes its Japanese setting, as his own invented reconstructions of Japanese music coexist with quotes from authentic Japanese music.  Moving between Eastern and Western styles, Puccini offers a musical representation of colliding cultures.","4","4","Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts","1601 Broadway Blvd.","64108","Not Applicable.","Cultural","The event will occur in the Crossroads Arts District, a neighborhood full of innovative restaurants, vibrant art galleries, a world-class performing arts center, specialty boutiques, and residences.  The Crossroads is best known for its arts and entertainment culture, and visitors will find an array of artistic expression within a few walkable blocks.  The iconic Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts is set in the northwest corner of the arts district.  The center showcases a variety of performances including symphonies, operas, ballets, and concerts in addition to special guest speakers, and conferences.  The Crossroads also hosts a First Friday event each month which gathers the community together in celebration of local artists, art organizations, and local businesses.

This will include promoting the event on their web calendar and sharing photos of the production for inclusion on the website. Our publicist also communicates with regional tourism writers about upcoming productions and special-interest stories related to those productions. Our marketing director and group sales associate will also investigate ways to reach conventioneers who are here during the run of Madama Butterfly and invite them to experience the performing arts culture of Kansas City.",,"Because of our continuing artistic growth, particularly since becoming a resident organization at the Kauffman Center in the 2011-12 season, the Lyric Opera now draws the finest opera singers, directors, designers, and conductors from around the world to appear on our stage.  As a result, the Lyric Opera has a growing national reputation for artistic excellence, and people across the country who follow opera are aware of our productions and travel to Kansas City to see them.  Also, the Kauffman Center, where the performances will take place, has enormous appeal as an event destination.  The New York Times music critic Zachary Woolfe called it ""one of the most enjoyable, exhilarating arts centers I've been to, a moving celebration of a city's upward trajectory.""  Moreover, as the only professional opera company within a two-hundred-mile radius, we are able to draw patrons from many surrounding communities.","The Lyric Opera has established a local reputation for artistic excellence, and this reputation for work that is always spectacular will draw audiences from other neighborhoods.  Residents from other neighborhoods will also be drawn to the event because the Lyric is strengthening its presence across the city through its numerous educational and community engagement programs.  In addition, the local publicity preceding and accompanying our production of Madama Butterfly will attract residents from other neighborhoods because the publicity will highlight the strong appeal of this particular work, which is one of the most popular operas ever written.","We anticipate that 6,202 persons will come to the neighborhood to see the four public performances of Madama Butterfly.  Many will combine their attendance at the performances with dining at nearby restaurants, and visiting nearby shops and retail establishments.  To increase this traffic, the Lyric Opera has a partnership with restaurants in the Crossroads District (Grunauer at 101 West 22nd Street and Affare at 1911 Main) for a dinner and a show special that encourages dining at these Crossroads restaurants.  Of these 6,202 attendees, 26% or 1,613 attendees will be residents of Kansas City, Missouri, and thus live close enough to the Crossroads neighborhood to regularly return following this exposure to the attractions that the neighborhood has to offer.In addition, 74% or 4,589 attendees will be from outside of Kansas City Missouri, and 9% or 558 attendees will be from far enough away to stay at a hotel when they come to see the show.  This means that the 4,589 tourists from outside Kansas City, Missouri who attend Madama Butterfly will combine their attendance at the performances with dining at nearby restaurants, and visiting nearby shops and retail establishments.  We can project the dollar value of this event-related spending.  Over the years, the arts advocacy group Americans for the Arts has compiled data about all the things that people spend money on when they attend an arts event.  As a result, they have created an economic impact calculator which, when information is entered about the number of attendees, the size of the metropolitan area, and the presenting organization, will calculate the amount of event-related spending by attendees, which includes money spent at nearby restaurants, retail establishments, hotels, and parking.  Plugging in the projected numbers for Madama Butterfly, the economic impact calculator predicts over $214,394 in event-related spending by people coming to see the production.  74%, or $158,652, of this event-related spending will come from non-residents of Kansas City.    As mentioned above, we can predict that 558 of the tourists coming to Madama Butterfly will come from far enough away that they will be staying at a hotel while they are here.  Being conservative, and assuming that they will be staying just one night, that they are couples so that there are two people in every hotel room, and that the average hotel room will be $114 a night, that comes to $31,806 in hotel income.","The evaluation of our productions in the 2018-19 season is a process that occurs throughout the season, as a weekly meeting of senior staff identifies and monitors ongoing issues with our artistic, education, and community engagement programming.  Through these meetings, unexpected developments can be identified and action taken to adjust the project as necessary.  As part of our evaluation of our artistic programming, after the final performance of each production, the production and artistic staff discuss all aspects of the production including the performances of the singers and the chorus, how successful the director and design team were in creating the directors artistic vision, and how well the orchestra and conductor executed the score.  We also monitor critical reviews in the newspapers and magazines and online, as well as comments by individuals via social media.  Our ticketing office tracks attendance at the productions and we elicit audience feedback to assess how our productions are received by the public.  Attendance at our education programs is tracked by our Department of Education and Community Engagement.  Our education programs are also evaluated through feedback from teachers and participating students.","In calculating the tourism impact of this event, we have used our ticketing database, which records who has bought tickets to our past productions, and where those ticket buyers are from.  Specifically, we looked at the ticket buyers for our 2012 production of Madama Butterfly, which also took place at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.  The ticket sales indicate that there were 6,202 attendees at the 2012 production of Madama Butterfly, and we are projecting a comparable number of attendees at our November 2018 production of Madama Butterfly.  Based on this same ticketing data, we can predict that, of the 6,202 attendees at our upcoming production of Madama Butterfly, 74% or 4,589 will be from outside of Kansas City, Missouri, and 9% or 558 will be from far enough way to stay at a hotel when they come to see the show.","POINT (-94.588707 39.093796)","39.0941843 -94.5875135"

This let&#39;s us know that the tournament was a success, ran professionally and was very organized, so much so that teams enjoyed it enough to return the following year.  The key to success in operating tournaments is the organization of the tournament and how it was ran.  Nets Developmental League continues to get positive feedback on our tournament organization and how effective our tournament was. Furthermore, we always send out emails/text messages to coaches, thanking them for participation in the tournament and soliciting any thoughts on how we can improve the tournament as a whole.  By doing this, our tournaments continue to grow in size year after year.  This growth is what attracts corporate sponsorship to be apart of our tournaments.","We use admission wrist bands at every location that provides an accurate account of people attending the tournament.

KC Fringe Festival will be promoted at Waterfire and InspireKC. And Fringe Festival performers will perform at Waterfire. We expect this improved marketing and branding strategy to result in increased ticket sales. We will invest heavily in our marketing initiatives during the coming year.There is a KC Fringe Festival performance in nearly every artistic discipline and genre. From touching family productions to late night theater, from traditional dance to martial arts, there is something for every taste, every age and every culture. Tickets for a Fringe performance cost only $10 for adults and are free for youth. Volunteers earn free tickets; even families on the tightest budgets can take part. KC Fringe is now regularly reviewed by all local mainstream and alternative media. Shows and performers often win awards.

KC Creates' vision for Kansas City's art community is a vital, creative community, in which the arts ignite shared experiences and unexpected connections.","KC Creates is active in the community, and partners with the KC Convention & Visitors Association. Our marketing team sends press releases, programs and postcards to KCCVA, local hotels, and local businesses. We also use social media to promote our events to both local and regional audiences. KC Creates is also a member of the Greater Kansas City Attractions Association and several local Chambers of Commerce.",,"Kansas City, Missouri is widely becoming known as an arts and culture hotspot  the Huffington Post named Kansas City the ""coolest"" city in America. This event supports Kansas City's status a ""the place to be"". The Kansas City Fringe Festival is the only time during the year where a visitor  particularly someone with a limited amount of time to spend in the city  can see a wide range of affordable, diverse arts events. If someone has only a week of vacation, or even a long weekend, they can still see dozens of performances, many of which are within walking distance or a short cab ride from downtown, Crown Center or Plaza hotels. The Fringe Festival is attractive to families, theater lovers, dance lovers and music lovers. There are Fringe Festivals around the United States and the world, with the original Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland. KC Fringe Festival is a member of the United States Association of Fringe Festivals. There are 40 Fringe Festivals in North America and more than 100 world wide. At the Annual Association meeting, KC Fringe Festival connects with leaders from around the country and the world. While the majority of KC Fringe participants and audiences are Kansas City metro residents, KC Creates recruits both national and international artists to the KC Fringe Festival to bring unique and socially significant productions to the KC Fringe Festival. We also promote the KC Fringe Festival to other Fringe organizations. These recruiting efforts attract new audiences to the KC Fringe Festival by bringing outside groups that KC audiences wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to see. Those outside groups also promote their productions to their own audiences and patrons, attracting audience members from out of town as well.","The Kansas City Fringe Festival has something for everyone  every age, every artistic taste, and every budget. We have special performances geared towards youth 12 and under, teens from 1318, and adults. All YOUth Fringe performances and activities are free! We also have diverse genres, including visual art, theater, musical theater, dance, music, spoken word, poetry, variety, comedy and much more. New genres are introduced every year at the Festival.The Kansas City Fringe Festival is recognized, both locally and nationally as one of the most inclusive arts events available. Artists from other cities come to Kansas City just to perform in the Festival. And Fringe Festivals worldwide are similarly know for their inclusiveness. The Kansas City Fringe Festival attracts a highly diverse group of artists. We have youth artists, teen artists, and everything from 20somethings up to senior artists. We have artists from multiple cultures  Asian, Indian, Native American, African American, LGBTQ and more. Diversity in our artists and performers is key to attracting diverse audiences. Kansas City, Missouri is one of the most diverse places in the country  according to an analysis by WalletHub, Kansas City, MO ranks in the top 200 most diverse cities in the United States. So diversity in our artists is key to appealing to the diverse residents of Kansas City. This diversity attracts not only diverse audiences, it appeals to other audiences eager to learn about other cultures and broaden their own knowledge and experiences. The Kansas City Fringe Festival served nearly 20,000 people last year, and we expect to serve at least 10% more in the coming year.","In 2017, the KC Fringe Festival brought nearly 20,000 people to neighborhoods spanning from downtown to the Country Club Plaza. Our primary marketing mechanism is electronic; we use social media and our website. The Festival has over 20 venues, and our audience comes from both sides of the state line, bringing hundreds and sometimes thousands of audience members to venues and the surrounding local businesses. This event covers multiple neighborhoods; many venues participate in their local neighborhood associations. In addition to the festival-wide marketing done by KC Creates, each venue promotes its own performances. Artists and performers also promote their shows. We have excellent social media exposure as a result of the combined efforts of KC Creates' marketing committee, volunteers, venues and artists. In 2018, KC Creates is introducing a new marketing effort to assist artists and venues in promoting their productions. Artists and venues all promote their own shows, but many do not have formal marketing training or even experience in the area. KC Creates marketing staff will create a marketing plan for artists and provide training on how to implement it. This plan may include information on how to promote their production via social media, creating press releases, photographing their work, and more. This is a key element of our new marketing and branding efforts.","The Kansas City Fringe Festival is an open-access festival. We measure the success of the Festival as a whole by overall ticket sales. Our ticket sales increase steadily  typically varying from 12-30% annually. This variation mirrors the economy; when the economy is slow, growth is slower, when the economy is healthy, growth is much higher. Growing ticket sales indicate a strong demand for our events  affordable, diverse arts events. The success of individual Fringe Festival performances is also measured by ticket sales  for that performance. A variety of things can impact ticket sales  the time and day of the week that an event is scheduled can either increase or decrease ticket sales. Conflicting schedules with other highly popular events can also impact ticket sales. Artists also evaluate the success of their performances or events from another perspective. For example, they may be testing a new genre or a new original piece of work. Feedback from the audience may help the artists either further develop a piece of work, or abandon it and start again. So while ticket sales are a good indicator of a high quality event, they are not the only means of evaluation.","KC Creates is able to collect geographic information on our audience based on the addresses of audience members who purchase tickets with a credit or debit card. We know that about half of our audience comes from Kansas City, Missouri, and half comes from outside the city. The majority of visitors are coming from the metro area and immediate area surrounding it. A majority come from Johnson County, KS.This method of collecting geographic information isn't perfect  it excludes tickets purchased with cash. But it does encompass the majority of our audience, since most audience members purchase tickets online before attending events.","POINT (-94.588079 39.083427)","39.0853282 -94.5855784"

We never see her, but only hear her in a few passages as a disembodied, angelic voice. Given the joshing tone of much of the show, this makes sense, since it would be incongruous to grind the gears at the end by showing Othello murdering his innocent wife.

We are also strengthening our relationship with Isle of Capri and feel that if we both cross promote this event, we would both benefit with increased attendance and interest.

The two-day event honors the 1990 passage of the pivotal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by offering multifaceted family-friendly outdoor entertainment, community resources, and vendors on the last weekend of July. In 2017, we welcomed 1,225 people from nearby neighborhoods and across the metro. Next summer, we are on the cusp of growing the July Jubilee into a regional destination point by adding a non-ticketed open-air concert to kick it off, and by merging the Monday activities into a larger Saturday celebration. We need NTDF support for advertising and radio publicity this year to catalyze the events potential and secure its prominence as an eagerly anticipated Main Street Corridor event.In 2018, the Jubilee will move to a Friday evening/Saturday timeframe. Five or more bandsjazz, country, popwill draw a large and diverse audience to 37th & Main on Friday evening, 5-10 pm, where food trucks, flea market vendors, community resource booths, a bounce house and other activities for children, and community speakers will intersperse with the music sets. Our large accessible stage will be placed on 37th Street between Main and Baltimore.The 2018 Saturday event will be similar to 2017. Saturday morning begins at 8 am under tent canopies, with Chris Cakes offering a reasonably priced, family-friendly all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast that continues to the close of the event at 2 pm. Free popcorn and water will also be available to attendees. Twenty to twenty-five booths will run concurrently, providing Makers Fair/Flea Market goods and community resources from organizations such as the Kidney Foundation, KC Public Library, Veterans groups, adaptive equipment businesses, and others that are relevant and important to people with disabilities. A DJ, local bands, dance groups and TWPs Tota Voces (whole voices) choir will perform on our 37th Street stage. Educational components of both the Friday and Saturday events include the appearance of local officials and disability rights advocates, who will provide their insights into history and importance of the ADA. Face painting, the bounce house, adaptive sports demonstrations, mascots from Kansas Citys professional sports teams, the Marching Pythons, and a troupe of Star Wars characters were all big hits with our audience last summer and will be invited back in 2018.Mayor Sly James was especially popular with our 2017 audience and many attendees had their photos taken with the Mayor and mascots. Other speakers, who also will be invited back in 2018, included the Mayor of Independence; federal, state and county legislators; Diane Burnett of the Main Street Corridor Development Corporation (MainCor); and Ms. Wheelchair Kansas.","4","4","The Whole Person","3710 Main Street","64111","N/A","Social","Old Hyde Park Historic District","1650","300","Annual","12500","5000","5000","180272","The mission of The Whole Person is to connect people with disabilities to the resources they need by supporting independent choice and advocating for positive change in the community.","TWP often works with Visit KC to promote our events and activities, and the July Jubilee is no exception. We will make sure that Visit KC has our event information on their Whats Happening This Weekend in Kansas City calendar, and we will confer with a Visit KC representative to determine the best approach for promoting our 2018 July Jubilee event, including the possibility of adding an event flyer to summer convention packets. We will continue to seek any and all opportunities to advertise the July Jubilee in major convention hotels in the downtown loop so they have the information on their TV channel calendar, and will advertise nationally by posting information about the event on the national ADA website.The primary way we will catalyze the 2018 July Jubilee event and its new Friday evening concert will be through the purchase of Steel Media radio publicity. We are negotiating for a four-week contract for several popular stations  93.3, KCKC 102, KFKF 94.1, and 104  to reach thousands more visitors and residents than we can in any other way.TWP also hopes to have the wonderful assistance of the City's Office of Culture and Creative Services in promoting the July Jubilee in 2018. Streetcar kiosk information can also help to get the word out about July Jubilee to tourists, convention attendees, other visitors and residents of Kansas City and beyond, and we would appreciate being added to Channel 2 announcements and the City Hall Lobby Directory Screen.","The Old Hyde Park Historic District (OHPHD) will be invited to attend and help welcome our July Jubilee audience. MainCor staff will assist in coordinating with the Old Hyde Park neighborhood association and its other neighborhood association members, which also include Heart of Westport Neighborhood Association, Southmoreland Neighborhood Association, and Union Hill Neighborhood Association; MainCor will also assist with event security and Main Street Corridor visibility, and will consider sponsoring the event in 2018 as it did in 2015 and 2016. The executive director of MainCor, Diane Burnett, will serve as one of our speakers and MainCor will have a community resource booth.Letters of support from both OHPHD and MainCor are attached.","People who dont live in the Kansas City will travel to July Jubilee events on Friday and Saturday 2018 because they are free, family-friendly activities with features that appeal to children and adults alike. People who live farther away from the event will find their way to 37th & Main because July Jubilee is unique and provides a rare way to celebrate the capacity of people with all types of disabilities to live independently. Any individual with a disability themselves, or with a family member or friend with disabilities, or a special or professional interest in disability rights and advocacy will be drawn to visit this event should they become aware of it while visiting Kansas City or encountering our event promotions and other marketing.","The Main Street Corridor has been in a state of transition over the past several years. Blocks of decaying buildings and shuttered businesses have taken on a new life. The Whole Person was part of this regrowth when we took ownership of the historic Goodenow Textiles Building, constructed in 1929, to house all TWP programs, services and staff. TWP brought new life to a city block, and our parking lot events have brought that life out of doors and invited the participation of the community. On the Saturday and Monday of our first July Jubilee last summer, people who worked in the area walked down to the event on their lunch break to enjoy the free hot dogs and popcorn and perhaps listen to a speaker or two. Residential neighbors all along the corridor joined us, and people riding the bus stopped and stayed a while. This kind of street involvement would have been unheard of a decade ago, when this was a neighborhood to pass through quickly, not to enjoy.This growth has been expanded by Kansas City Young Audiences (KCYA), a new TWP collaboration partner. The venerated nonprofit purchased the building next door to TWP at 3732 Main Street and began operations there in 2017. To have another stable nonprofit business move to our neighborhood is a cause for celebration. With Ability KC and other very visible nonprofits on Main Street, the Corridor is realizing an important goal of becoming known across Kansas City for its nonprofit organizations and the arts. The July Jubilee appeals to people throughout Kansas City and beyond, not only because it is a unique event but also because it is a unique observation of groundbreaking historical legislation. The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act is not widely known, yet we see its results every day. We take for granted the public accommodations that have been put in place because of the ADA, but before 1990 they were not as universally available as they are today.","The Main Street Corridor and its member neighborhood associations welcome the open-air, family friendly July Jubilee events presented by The Whole Person, with families coming together outdoors to enjoy food and music, shopping and even dancing. The unusual nature of the event was one of the reasons for doing it, in our estimation. It was already unique to have a nonprofit business serving the public in the neighborhood, why not take advantage of that unique situation to call attention to The Whole Person and our surroundings? A member of TWPs Resource Development team attends all meetings of the Old Hyde Park Historic District in order to keep its members informed about and invited to our events on Main Street. TWP enjoys a closer partnership with MainCor, which supports the July Jubilee by participating, helping with promotion, and providing security. TWPs Resource Development Manager, Terri Goddard, currently serves as MainCor Vice President in a time of many big changes, improvements, and growth benefiting Main Street businesses and organizations. The July Jubilee serves an important role in encouraging more people from through the metropolitan area and region to feel more and more comfortable in thinking of Main Street as a welcoming destination point.","Public attendance numbers are one measure of success, as well as the attendance of and support from a wide array of public officials, grant funders, corporate sponsors, partner organizations and community volunteers. Experienced staff and volunteers estimate attendance, although this is difficult in the case of a come and go event. Geographic distribution among attendees will be captured as described above. We will also request and receive informative feedback from our vendors, as we did in 2017 when they were so successful in selling their goods and services. And of course we will get feedback from the attendees themselves, who continue to attend and support the event, saying they appreciate having a family-friendly event in a part of midtown that is not usually a setting for such gatherings. And finally, we will have evaluations from the staff, who will be aware of how the event is working on several levels: as a party in the parking lot with bands, food, speakers and vendors as well as an event that offers insight into American history and the rights of people with disabilities.","Staff and volunteers make demographic assessments, insofar as this can be done with a free-flowing, open air event with multiple points of entry. One method to gauge where attendees reside is to request and record the home ZIP Codes of as many of our guests as possible. In 2017, we initiated a highly successful strategy both to capture ZIP Codes and encourage attendees to visit every vendor and community resource representative. Staff and volunteers distributed Passport cards to audience members, prompting them to write down their home ZIP Code and collect initials from booths they visited in order to receive a complimentary gift. We plan to continue collecting audience information in this manner.","POINT (-94.585919 39.059717)","39.0596753 -94.5862637"

Since event parking requires that some guests drive through neighborhood streets, all affected property owners are made aware of traffic flow and are welcome to give input. The Run to Serve the World 5k route goes through streets of both HOAs so HOA leadership and residents work together with Serve the World leadership to create a communication plan for residents and create the best race route for participants and residents. The HOAs also organize neighborhood activities around the event.","Fireworks at Evangel draws people from a large area of the KC Metro. This is in part due to the membership of Evangel Church. Evangel not only draws a large group from Kansas City but from other areas of the KC Metro. A large portion of the 1,000 plus membership of Evangel Church comes from Lee's Summit, Olathe, Overland Park, Raytown, and as far away as North Kansas City and Desoto. These people invite their friends and neighbors to the event which creates a larger reach. The advertisement of the event with Life 88.5 and Kansas City Running Company also extends the reach of the participants to those outside of the city limits of Kansas City.","Fireworks are a great attraction for people of all ages and from all walks of life. South Kansas City is a racially and generationally diverse area. The audience of Fireworks at Evangel truly reflects this diversity. With a new and ongoing relationship with the Center School District, Serve the World Charities and Evangel Church are poised to create an even larger impact with the community and this event.","Fireworks at Evangel allows the residents of Indian Heights and Linden Hills a great opportunity to gather with one another and others from outside of their neighborhood. Many residents host parties at their homes on the evening of the event which creates a truly unique experience for them, their friends, and family.  All of the residents of Indian Heights and Linden Hills are within walking distance of Evangel Church which makes this a great location for them to enjoy a quality event. Also, the Run to Serve the World 5k will give many residents the opportunity to participate in a healthy activity.","Success of the event is based on three things. 1.

These ""atlarge"" teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee, then announced in a nationally televised event on the Sunday preceding the First Four playin games, currently held in Dayton, Ohio, and dubbed Selection Sunday.

Each team is ""seeded"", or ranked, within its region from 1 to 16. After an initial four games between eight lowerranked teams, the tournament occurs during the course of  three weekends, at preselected neutral sites across the United States. Teams, seeded by rank, proceed through a single game elimination bracket beginning with a first round consisting of 64 teams, to a ""Sweet Sixteen"" which is competed at one of four locations with Kansas City being the site of the Midwest, and for the last weekend of the tournament, a Final Four.

It also gives NSN access to the best of the individual storytellers in the world that we showcase their skills and narrative programming to conference attendees and to the Kansas City public in over 20 concert formatted events: Fringes, Showcases, Story Slam and Main Stage Concert.   One of our goals is by attracting so many storytellers, it helps reduce our costs for our Concert Series.   Our Kansas City 2017 Conference & Concert Series survey showed that 86% of our attendees rated their experiences as great or outstanding.  For the past three years we have also been building our Concert Series with our Kansas City Institutional Partner Mid Continent Library (MCPL) so we can reach another goal -to build Kansas City as a national storytelling attraction highlighting the Woodneath Story Center.  Just as MCPLs Midwest Genealogy Center draws a national offering focused on family history. The Woodneath Story Center offers specialized collections and program focused upon the art of story.  The vision for Woodneath is one of many layers: adaptive reuse of a historic home,( a point of Kansas Citys Northland pride), a cultural amenity for the region and a national resource for those interested in the art of story.  With 33 acres of land surrounding the Woodneath Center, the grounds will offer a larger indoor auditorium and a 400 seat outdoor amphitheater for storytelling performances; trail system and cultural nooks to tell the story of the historic, natural and civic importance of storytelling and Woodneath.  With the Summit (conferences) held here in Kansas City this has given us the kick start to attract the attention needed to launch our efforts. Another goal is to attract nationally recognized storytellers to Kansas City.

In the short term, this is measured by the numbers of both returning and new patrons and our ability to continue to take risks and challenge ourselves with a stimulating production. As for longer-term objectives, when planning future programming, TLR&#39;s artistic leaders consider several factors,including the following: (1) Revisiting previous programs that created buzz, thoughtful evaluation and attendance from our audiences and seek out similarly-themed works in order to expand on the appeal and elevate the conversation, (2) program theater which fits our mission of providing contemporary thought-provoking theater (or revamping classics in a fresh new way), and (3) continuing to program New Works which nurture local artists, with the ultimate goal of developing a stronger, more independently generative Kansas City arts community.

With that, the importance of awareness has reached a national high and those affected directly or indirectly are looking for ways to make a difference.  Kansas City has a number of organizations who are working tirelessly to increase awareness , but have not had an appropriate platform to invigorate the effort.  In 2016 the Kansas City Chiefs announced they were meeting with local groups to outline an approach for awareness training.  This is a major step toward addressing the local impact domestic violence has had on our community; spearheaded by a national professional organization.It is apparent, that across the globe domestic violence has become an epidemic in the younger and older generations, but there is not enough collaboration on a local or national level to connect education, support, and resources to make the victims of these devastating acts feel safe or informed as to what their options are.Across the U.S., there are very few states that have long standing widely attended domestic violence conferences.  We believe we have the support, and potential to make Kansas City another location for such a conference for years to come.","Through the love of shoes, the Hot Stiletto Shoe Club has drawn women from all over the city to an event that feeds the fetish for the rights to lay claim to The Hottest Pair of Stilletos in Kansas City.

The excitement and enthusiasm for our event has spawned the curiosity and intrigue of the gentlemen as well. Not only do they want to see ladies display their high heels, but they too are preparing months ahead of our event to lay claim to the Hottest Shoes in Kansas City. The involvement from the community and retail supporters like Dillard's, Designer Shoe Warehouse (DSW) and Aldo's has been extremely positive.  Our commitment to making a difference in the lives of those touched by domestic violence has resonated throughout our City through the love of shoes.   We believe the mission and vision of the organization have literally walked across boundaries.   It is our desire to make Kansas City the home of not only a national movement, but the home of an organization that supports and uplifts women through our Annual Charity Shoe Gala and conference.","The Wendell Phillips Neighborhood is more notably known as the 18th and Vine Jazz District.
