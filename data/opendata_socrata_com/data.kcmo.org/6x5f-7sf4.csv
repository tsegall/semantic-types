When visitors exit their vehicles anywhere in the garage, they'll hear music coming from the ceiling. As they pass through the garage toward an exit or in the main garage stairway, people will notice that the music is unique to the space-one of three original compositions creted specifically for the garage by composers David Moulton, Roberta Vacca and Bobby Watson. Visitors approaching the center piece of artwork-a four-story ""light organ"" situated in the central stair tower of the garage-will see the light moving up and down inside the seven, four-story acrylic tubes choreographed with the music.

In November of 1997, under the leadership of its late chairman John “Buck” O’Neil, that dream became a reality when the NLBM moved into its new 10,000 square-foot home inside a cultural complex known as the Museums at 18th & Vine.","POINT (-94.562704 39.09118)"

The original design for the rose garden included a small lily pool in the center of the garden, which was built and dedicated in 1936.  In 1939, a sculpture entitled ""Spirit of the Rose Garden"" was placed in the pool with gentle sprays of water at her feet.  Her sculptor was Walter Rosenbauer, who was also an instructor at the Kansas City Art Institute.  ""Spirit of the Rose Garden"" remained there until the early 1950s.

In the late 1970s, a modernistic-style fountain was donated in memory of Florence L. Nelson by the Oscar D. and Florence L. Nelson Fund.  The center water feature and the surrounding steel poles with their water sprays were meant to represent flowers and blossoms.  That fountain was dedicated in 1980 and remained there until 2001.

The Kansas City Rose Society began raising funds for the creation and purchase of a new fountain in 2001.  Dedicated in August 2002, the fountain bowl is of a classic design and carved of buff-colored stone from Vincenza, Italy.  The bill for the new fountain and its installation was $750,000 and was paid for by private donations.  New sidewalks, lights and a renovated pool were also part of the project.

The rose garden features walking paths, pegolas, benches and, of course, roses of many different species and colours.  It is in the northwest part of Loose Park",

The pedestal fountain consists of a circular base, saucer receptacle and a rectangular shaft which rises to a height of six feet. Four eagles are carved into the corners at the summit. Two bronze plaques illustrate soldiers on one side and sailors on the other. The artist, from Topeka, Kansas, became Professor of Sculpture at the University of Southern California.

The heights of the jets decrease as the fountain goes west.  The pool stretches west toward the performance area curving into the distance for a total length of 180 feet.

The fountain welcomes guests as they enter the east side of the theatre.  It is also a favorite resting spot for theatre-goers and has surely served as the backdrop of thousands, if not millions, of photographs taken at Starlight Theatre.  It has also been the site of numerous weddings and private events.

The fountain and surrounding garden commemorate Barnett and Shirley Helzberg's longtime dedication to Starlight Theatre.  The former owners of Helzberg Jewelers donated $1 million toward the creation of the site.  Mrs. Helzberg served as president of the Starlight Board of Directors from 1991 to 1994.",

The appropriateness of the fountain as a memorial to our boys who fought so valiantly for their country can be seen in the intimate usefulness associated with them.  This memorial fountain and the American Legion Memorial I fountain were “erected in places where passing throngs will see and use them, sets forth an informal tribute of people of Kansas City to the men who are among them again, mingling in the city’s activity and industry and achievement.”

The bronze panel illustrates twenty-two figures of American soldiers entering a ruined French village, wounded French soldiers and refugees.

 

Across the top of the monument are inscribed the words:

Dedicated by Kansas City to the American Legion Posts.

At the dedication services in Swope Park sixteen uniformed legionnaires uncovered the fountain draped in an American flag.  The presentation of the fountain was by Alderman George Harrington and the dedication address was given by John W. Inzer, national chaplain of the legion.

The installation by the Kansas City American Legion Posts was made possible by a $20,000 appropriation from City Council.  The cost of this fountain was $6,000.

A drinking fountain was originally included in this monument.",

The fountain was designed to celebrate children and Kansas City children were used as models for the figures. Local sculptor Tom Corbin created the six figures: Joy posing happily on one pedestal; Meeting Challenges represented by a boy with crutches; a ballerina; a boy playing soccer; a boy standing on his head and a girl wading into the pool of the fountain. They are each 8 to 9 feet tall and were based off of children that lived in his neighborhood.

Fundraising began in 1991, led by Anita Gorman, Northland resident and tireless Kansas City booster, who was President of the Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Board at the time. The $1.7 million was raised by public and private donations and the sale of dedicatory bricks for placement near the fountain. The fountain was designed by Larkin Aquatics and is one of the largest fountains in Kansas City.

On June 21, 1995, the fountain was turned on.  The dedication plaque says: ”The bronze figures represent children everywhere to whom this fountain is dedicated and the activities that shape young lives making childhood a joy.”  In the winter of 2015-16, the fountain was renovated and the sculptures were cleaned, giving new life to the fountain and park.

The fountain is located in the small park formed by North Oak Trafficway, NE 32nd and Burlington Street on the land that was donated by the Missouri Department of Transportation.  There is parking available on 32nd Street that gives easy access to the fountain.",

Unfortunately, its years as a movie theatre ended in 1960 and by the 1980s, it had faded into a shadow of its former glory.

As a result of the vision and perseverance of Kansas City’s civic leaders, the Gem was restored into a beautiful, state-of-the art performance venue. It stands today as one of the crown jewels of the 18th & Vine corridor.

Behind the restored 1912 façade is a modern 500-seat performing arts center, complete with state-of-the-art technology and equipment.

On any televised event from Kansas City, you can count on seeing a shot or footage of this fountain at some point. It sits at the south end of Mill Creek Park on the east side of Country Club Plaza.

 The figures were sculpted by Henri Gerber in 1910 and adorned the mansion of Clarence Mackay in Long Island, New York. Over the years, the fountain was vandalized and parts went missing. The purchase and installation of the fountain was funded by the JC Nichols family, the city and private contributions, including a collection by school children in the Kansas City area. It was brought to Kansas City in 1951, refurbished by Herman Frederick Simon and dedicated in 1960.

The fountain has four heroic horsemen which are said to represent four of the world’s mighty rivers: the Mississippi, the Volga, the Seine and the Rhine. It also has four smaller figures of children playing on fish, commonly referred to as dolphins. However, one of the original four dolphins had gone missing prior to purchase and so a replica was commissioned.

The fountain underwent an extensive renovation in 2014 that was funded by the Miller Nichols Charitable Foundation. As part of the renovation, the missing dolphin was found and took its rightful place in the fountain. The replica dolphin now sits nearby on a concrete base with an accompanying plaque describing its history and the history of the original it replaced.",

A two-tiered fountain pool and two winding concrete staircases complete the monument.

The sculpture once stood over the Seventh Street entrance to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in New York City - once billed as ""the largest structure in the world devoted solely to the use and convenience of railroad passenger"" - from 1910 until the station closed in 1963 and the building demolished.  A large clock was within the wreath welcoming travelers and commuters to the station.  

Eagle Badges were first awarded in 1912 to Scouts of the highest achievement.  The badge features a silver eagle suspended from a red, white and blue scroll.  A knot hangs from the scroll signifying the Scout slogan:  ""Do a Good Turn Daily.""

In 1966, Kansas City businessman and National Boy Scout executive John W. ""Twink"" Starr arranged through a friend at the Pennsylvania Railroad to have the sculpture brought to Kansas City when the station in New York was demolished.  Kansas City architect Maurice McMullen designed the setting for the historic sculpture and included a fountain with two spiral stairways to complete the memorial.  Starr, with his wife, Martha Jane Phillips Starr, and other supporters of the Boy Scouts provided the funds to construct the fountain.  Hoffman Cortez Construction completed the work in 1968.

In 2013, an additional gift by the Martha Jane Phillips Starr Donor Advised Fund provided the funds to pay for renovations, upgrades, sculpture restoration and site work at the landmark fountain.  The landscaping is partially maintained by local Scouts.","POINT (-94.580035 39.05636)"

Volker was a prominent citizen and philanthropist who had done so much to enrich Kansas City including donating the land on which to start the university now know as the University of Missouri - Kansas City.

The central sculpture is of St. Martin of Tours on horseback cutting his cloak in order to share with the beggar below.  Nearby, a bewildered faun, a seated angel and a flying angel playing a flute watch the scene.  To add a touch of humour, Milles has the flying angel playing the flute backwards and he added a wristwatch on the seated angel. Bruno Bearzi of Florence, Italy was founder for the equestrian figure and Herman Bergman of Stockholm, Sweden was the founder of the other figures.

The monumental fountain was originally in Theis Park, in the current amphitheatre location, but was moved in the 1990's across Brush Creek to this site on Volker Boulevard, just south of the Park.  Looking north from the fountain gives a clear view of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.

In the winter of 2015-2016, the sculptures were removed and cleaned and repaired.  The fountain also underwent extensive repairs and renovations.  Everything was back in place and put back into operation on Fountain Day 2016 for the rededication ceremony.

Davis Civic Mall Fountain, Ilus Winfield Davis Fountain.

Ilus W. Davis Park was named after the man who served as mayor of Kansas City during the 1960s and is associated ith the city's growth and progress.  The park strengths the north-south axis and adds softness and colour to the government district, often referred to as the Civil Mall, on the northeast side of downtown Kansas City.

The park features a large, shallow reflecting pool.  A small fountain with a short water jets, due to the strong winds that tend to blow through the park, provides water that cascades down a stair-step style waterfall that feeds the reflecting pool.  The park contains flowerbeds and more than 350 trees, including flowering crab, large red oaks and ginkgoes.  The City Employees Memorial sits on the east side of the park along Locust Street.  The Bill of Rights monument sits in the northeast corner of the park while a statue of Ilus Winfield Davis stands in the southwest corner.

First conceived and planned in the 1990s, the park cost about $15 million to build, including land acquisition and demolition of existing structures.  The money came from local tax revenues, gambling revenues, federal funds and the local business community.  Architect Cindy Frewen-Wuellner of Sasaki Associates, the architecture firm that designed the park, said, ""It is a great place for civic events, which was one of our missions.""  The park is modeled after Post Office Square in Boston, a heavily used public area.  Frewen-Wuellner decided to embrace the contour of the land which consists of a 36-foot rise rather than build retaining walls.  The park was built by Vanum Construction Company of Kansas City, KS.",

In 2015, this fountain was taken out of service when continual flooding into the vault containing its pump and electrical equipment rendered it inoperable.  Funds for the million-dollar renovations were raised in part by the City of Fountains Foundation and a neighborhood alliance headed by David Fowler. The fountain was repaired and now boasts a new vault, new plumbing, new lighting, and a repaired basin.

The fountain was re-dedicated on October 25, 2017.  The Meyer Circle Sea Horse Fountain is one of Kansas City's most popular and most visible fountains. Located in the traffic circle at Ward Parkway and Meyer Boulevard, nearly 40,000 vehicles pass by the fountain every day.  It is a treasured part of the Ward Parkway corridor and it is good to have it running again.",

Haff became an essential influence in the direction that the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Board has evolved into today.  In 1937, a circle just west of Swope Park was designed and dedicated to this important figure in Kansas City history.  The circle and fountain welcomes visitors to the west entrance of Swope Park and pays tribute to one of Kansas City's most influential proponents of the local parks system.

The sculptor, Jorgen Dreyer, was commissioned to design a bust of Delbert Haff in 1916 but when completed it was placed into storage.  In 1937, Delbert J. Haff Circle was designed by Wilbur H. Dunn with construction being overseen by J. V. Lewis.  A mirror pool was added in 1939.  The landscaped circle and mirror pool were officially dedicated in 1940.  The fountain elements were added in 1966.  Finally in 1967, the bust of Delbert J. Haff was taken out of storage and placed upon a granite base at the west end of the circle. 

The bronze bust looks out over the mirror pool and fountains and towards Swope Park and sits 15 feet west of the west end of the pool.  The granite base is 52 inches tall and the bust is shielded on top and on the sides by a granite canopy which tops out at 94 inches high.  Haff Circle is 600 feet long.  The pool is 160 feet long by 60 feet wide.  The area is landscaped with flowers with benches.  The pool has a low retaining wall of coursed stone.  The fountains consists of a center spray ring and seven vertical jets that operate year round.  The Delbert J.

Located in a small plaza at the intersection of Southwest Boulevard and Summit Street, the Westside Fountain is the result of major effort by Kansas City's Hispanic community.

The fountain consists of a large jet in the middle of a upper basin.  The upper basin has scuppers all around it and the water flows through them down into the lower basin.  The fountain is circular in shape and has two steps around it.

The Westside fountain is also one of the more unique and colourful fountains in Kansas City.  Small blue tiles cover the outside of the upper basin while dark orange or tan tiles cover the top.  Larger tiles make up a colourful pattern that repeats in between each set of scuppers.  Five painted vertical steel beams topped with colorful elements form a semi-circle behind the fountain.  Landscaping fills in the area between the beams and the fountain.","POINT (-94.593811 39.084718)"

Due to a special design that can keep water flowing in freezing temperatures, it is one of three city fountains (the others are the Northland Fountain and the Delbert Haff Circle Fountain) that runs year-round.

The original water feature at this location was a shallow pool built in 1939, known as the Northeast Concourse Casting Pool, that was used to sail small boats and as a casting pool.  In the 1940's, it was popular among fishermen who could practice their art of casting.  A few small sprays of water were added to the pool in the 1980s, giving it a whole new identity.",
