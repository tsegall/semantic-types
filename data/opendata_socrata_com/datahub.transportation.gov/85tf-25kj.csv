SINCE THIS WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON, CSX ROADMASTER CONTACTED THE BN ROADMASTER AGAIN TO RECONFIRM THE FINDINGS THEY AGREED TO ON THE EVENING OF THE DERAILMENT. THE BN ROADMASTER STATED THAT HE HAD RETURNED TO THE LOCATION THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND INVESTIGATED A LOCATION FURTHER DOWN ON HIS PORTION OF THE CONNECTION TRACK AND DETERMINED THAT THE TRAIN HAD DERAILED IN TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. HE SAID HE THEN RECOMMENDED CHANGING HIS INITIAL T110 CAUSE CODE TO A TRAIN HANDLING CAUSE CODE H599 BASED ON HIS BELIEF THAT THE TRAIN HAD STRING LINED THE CURVE. THIS WAS NOT CONVEYEDTO CSX PRIOR TO NOV. 29TH AND THE CAUSE CODE PROVIDED BY BN TO CSXT TRANSPORTATION OFFICER WAS THE T102 CODE.

THE INCIDENT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY THE NYA AS AN FRA REPORTABLE ACCIDENT/INCIDENT BECAUSE THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT IN THE FIELD BY NYA MANAGEMENT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE TRACK STRUCTURE, SAVE FOR A SHORT SEGMENT OF FIBERGLASS THIRD RAIL PROTECTION BOARD. TRACK REPAIRS WERE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $2,800. REPAIRS TO THE CAR WERE ESTIMATED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER THE REPORTING THRESHOLD.

THE LIRR ESTIMATED DAMAGES AT $13,654 WHICHARE DISPUTED BY NYA AS BEING MUCH GREATER THAN THE 'IN-KIND' REPLACEMENT COSTS FOR THE DAMAGE INCURRED AS NO WHEELS LEFT THE RUNNING RAILS AND THE TRACK BED SUFFERED NO DAMAGE.

THE CREW HAD MADE A SET OUT OF THE REAR 21 CARS INTO TINKER LEAD, IN DOING SO THE DYNAMIC FORCES CAUSED THE LEAD SET OF TRUCKS TO LIFT UP OVER THE HIGH SIDE OF THE RAIL DERAILING THE WAMX 13816. THE WAMX 13816 BEING THE ONLY EMPTY CAR IN THE CONSIST LOCATED DIRECTLY AGAINST THE LOCOMOTIVES, COMBINED WITH EMPTY/LOAD RATIO AND POOR TRAIN HANDLING CAUSEDTHE WHEELS TO CLIMB THE RAIL.
