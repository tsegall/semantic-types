Read why in the definitive account of the 1918 Flu Epidemic. <br /><br />Magisterial in its breadth of perspective and depth of research, The Great Influenza provides us with a precise and sobering model as we confront the current pandemic. As Barry concludes, 'The final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that...those in authority must retain the public's trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.'<br /><br />John M. Barry is the author of four previous books: Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed Amer­ica; Power Plays: Politics, Football, and Other Blood Sports; The Transformed Cell: Unlocking the Mysteries of Cancer (cowritten with Steven Rosenberg); and The Ambition and the Power: A True Story of Washington.

In late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life  until the unthinkable happens.

Jacquie Red Feather is newly sober and trying to make it back to the family she left behind in shame. Dene Oxedrene is pulling his life together after his uncle's death and has come to work the powwow and to honor his uncle's memory. Edwin Frank has come to find his true father. Bobby Big Medicine has come to drum the Grand Entry. Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield has come to watch her nephew Orvil Red Feather; Orvil has taught himself Indian dance through YouTube videos, and he has come to the powwow to dance in public for the very first time. Tony Loneman is a young Native American boy whose future seems destined to be as bleak as his past, and he has come to the Powwow with darker intentions--intentions that will destroy the lives of everyone in his path. Tommy Orange delivers a wondrous and shattering portrait of an America few of us have ever seen. A multi-generational, relentlessly paced story about violence and recovery, hope and loss, identity and power, dislocation and communion, and the beauty and despair woven into the history of a nation and its people.","Offsite or Virtual Programs","Offsite or Virtual Programs

Historian Steve Isoardi will speak on Central Avenue and jazz in South LA in general. He is the author of 'The Dark Tree: Jazz and the Community Arts in Los Angeles' edited the oral history 'Central Avenue Sounds,' and collaborated with LA music legends Horace Tapscott and Buddy Colette on their memoirs.<br /><br />Bandleader Gerald Wilson came up playing trumpet on Central Ave. and went on to compose and arrange for numerous artists, as well as leading his own big band and teaching at UCLA. Working steadily until his 2014 passing at age 96, Wilson affected many styles and generations. For example, a cover of his song 'Viva Tirado' by the band El Chicano has become a iconic hip-hop beat, and Kamasi Washngton built his reputation as the star soloist in Wilson's last band. UCLA ethnomusicology professor Steve Loza, who worked with Wilson and recently published a book on him, will speak on his career and legacy.<br /><br />Both presentations will include audio and video recordings, and a question and answer period will conclude the program.","Main Library","601 Santa Monica Boulevard
