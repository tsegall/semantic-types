Seroadaptation strategies were practiced by 59.8 % of men, with 10.5 % practicing 100 % condom use, 26.5 % serosorting, 7.2 % condom serosorting, and 15.6 % seropositioning. In multivariable analyses, compared to men who used no seroadaptation strategies, serosorters were older, were less likely to be HIV infected, had fewer male sex partners, and had higher levels of social support and sexual self-efficacy. Condom serosorters had less psychological distress, were more likely to use methamphetamine, and had higher levels of sexual self-efficacy. Seropositioners were older, were less likely to be HIV infected, to have a main partner, and report alcohol/drug use with sex, while having higher levels of sexual self-efficacy. Seroadaptation practices among BMSM need to be considered to address perceived safer sex strategies and strengthen access to a broader reach of culturally-relevant prevention efforts.","Continental Europe; Double Blind Peer Reviewed; Editorial Board Reviewed; Europe; Expert Peer Reviewed; Peer Reviewed; USA.

For example, respondents with certain religious identities may reject the scientific framework of questions about the development of life and origins of the universe since there are competing truth claims between religion and science on these topics. Since the late 1970s, the National Science Foundation has sponsored a series of surveys to gauge public attitudes toward and understanding of science and technology. Items that simultaneously measure knowledge and acceptance of two concepts-evolution and the ""big bang""-appear to raise measurement problems for a specific subgroup that rejects the premise of the items. This paper focuses on alternative versions of the survey questions that attempt to remove the effect of religious belief on answers to these items. We investigate two approaches for removing this confounding of knowledge and acceptance. One approach is to ask what scientists think rather than what the respondents believe; the other is to remove ""hot-button"" features of the question likely to trigger conflicts between the religious and scientific views. We also illustrate how psychometric methods (such as confirmatory factor analysis) can help sort out which version of the questions produces the most valid answers.",,,"10.1093/poq/nfx049","Maitland, Aaron: amaitland@cdc.gov:Maitland, Aaron: National Center for Health Statistics, 3311 Toledo Road, Hyattsville, MD, US, 20782, amaitland@cdc.gov:Maitland, Aaron: Westat, MD, US:Tourangeau, Roger: Westat, MD, US:Sun, Hanyu: Westat, Rockville, MD, US",,,,,,"PsycINFO","Ovid Technologies","English",,"10.1093/poq/nfx049"

We examined how HIV care engagement outcomes (i.e., having a primary healthcare provider, receiving HIV treatment, taking antiretroviral medication, and medication adherence) vary by partnership status (single vs. concordant-positive vs. discordant) in a sample of young Black MSM living with HIV. Results showed mixed findings. Partnership status was significantly associated with HIV care engagement, even after adjusting for individual, social, and structural factors. While partnered men were consistently more likely than their single counterparts to have a regular healthcare provider, to receive recent treatment, and to have ever taken antiretroviral medication, they were less likely to report currently receiving antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, men with a discordant partner reported better adherence compared to men with a concordant or no partner. The association between partnership status and HIV care engagement outcomes was not consistent across the stages of the HIV Care Continuum, highlighting the complexity in how and why young Black men living with HIV engage in HIV healthcare. Given the social context of HIV disease management, more research is needed to explicate underlying mechanisms involved in HIV care and treatment that differ by relational factors for young Black MSM living with HIV.","1573-3254:Tan, Judy Y:Orcid: 0000-0003-4414-1035:Pollack, Lance:Rebchook, Greg:Peterson, John:Huebner, David:Eke, Agatha:Johnson, Wayne:Kegeles, Susan:P30 MH062246/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States:T32 MH019105/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States:UR6 PS000334/PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United States:R01 MH096690/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States:K01 MH106416/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States:L60 MD007466/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States:Journal Article:Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural:Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.:United States:AIDS Behav. 2018 Mar;22(3):774-790. doi: 10.1007/s10461-016-1601-9.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27844296","Division of Prevention Science, Department of Medicine, Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, 550 16th Street, 3rd Floor, 0886, San Francisco, CA, 94158-2549, USA. judy.tan@ucsf.edu.:Division of Prevention Science, Department of Medicine, Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, 550 16th Street, 3rd Floor, 0886, San Francisco, CA, 94158-2549, USA.:Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Department of Psychology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.:Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1007/s10461-016-1601-9"

METHODS: We conducted prospective, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance at Suzhou University-Affiliated Children's Hospital to estimate influenza-associated hospitalizations in Suzhou University-Affiliated Children's Hospital by month in children younger than 5 years of age from October 2011 to September 2016. SARI was defined as fever (measured axillary temperature >/= 38 degrees C) and cough or sore throat or inflamed/red pharynx in the 7 days preceding hospitalization. We combined SARI surveillance data with healthcare utilization survey data to estimate and characterize the burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations in Suzhou within this age group in the 5-year period. RESULTS: Of the 36,313 SARI cases identified, 2,297 from respiratory wards were systematically sampled; of these, 259 (11%) were influenza positive. Estimated annual influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates per 1,000 children younger than 5 years of age ranged from 4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2-5) in the 2012-2013 season to 16 (95% CI, 14-19) in the 2011-2012 season. The predominant viruses were A/H3N2 (59%) in 2011-12, both A/H1N1pdm09 (42%) and B (46%) in 2012-13, A/H3N2 (71%) in 2013-14, A/H3N2 (55%) in 2014-15 and both A/H1N1pdm09 (50%) and B (50%) in 2015-16. The age-specific influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates for the 5-year period were 11 (95% CI, 8-15) per 1,000 children 0-5 months of age; 8 (95% CI, 7-10) per 1,000 children 6-23 months of age and 5 (95% CI, 4-5) per 1,000 children 24-59 months of age, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From 2011 to 2016, influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates in children aged younger than 5 years of age in Suzhou, China, were high, particularly among children 0-5 months of age. Higher hospitalization rates were observed in years where the predominant circulating virus was influenza A/H3N2.

In the United States, HPV vaccination has been recommended for girls and women aged </=26 years, and since 2011, for boys and men aged </=21 years and for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) aged </=26 years. METHODS: Data were obtained from 27 clinics participating in the STD Surveillance Network. Trends in the annual prevalence of anogenital warts (AGW) from 2010-2016 were described by sex and by the sex of sex partners. RESULTS: During 2010-2016, significant declines in the prevalence of AGW were observed in women aged <40 years, men who have sex with women only (MSW) aged <40 years, and MSM of all age categories. An inflection in trend in 2012 was noted for MSW aged 20-24 or 25-29 years and for MSM aged 20-24 years. CONCLUSIONS: The observed declines in the prevalence of AGW suggest that HPV morbidity is declining among populations attending STD clinics, including MSW, MSM, and women. Declines in younger age groups are consistent with what would be expected following the implementation of HPV vaccination. However, declines were also observed in older age groups and are not likely to be the result of vaccination.","1537-6613:Mann, Laura M:Llata, Eloisa:Flagg, Elaine W:Hong, Jaeyoung:Asbel, Lenore:Carlos-Henderson, Juli:Kerani, Roxanne P:Kohn, Robert:Pathela, Preeti:Schumacher, Christina:Torrone, Elizabeth A:Journal Article:United States:J Infect Dis. 2019 Apr 16;219(9):1389-1397. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiy684.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500908","National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health, Pennsylvania.:County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health, California.:Seattle and King County Public Health, Washington.:San Francisco Department of Public Health, California.:New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York.:Baltimore City Health Department, Maryland.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/infdis/jiy684"

PBDE concentrations are higher in children than adults. A previous study found that prenatal PBDE exposure was associated with decreased reading skills in children; however, evidence is limited on the potential impact of childhood exposure to PBDEs. The study examined the association between childhood PBDE exposures and reading ability in children at ages 5 and 8years. METHODS: The study included 230 children from an ongoing prospective pregnancy and birth cohort study, the Health Outcomes and Measures of Environment (HOME) Study, conducted in Cincinnati, Ohio. Children's serum concentrations of eleven PBDE congeners were measured at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8years. The Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement - III and the Wide Range Achievement Test - 4 were administered to assess children's reading skills at ages 5 and 8years, respectively. We used multiple informant models to examine the associations between repeated measures of PBDEs and reading scores at ages 5 and 8years. We also estimated the betas and 95% CIs of the association of PBDE measure at each age by including interaction terms between PBDE concentrations and child age in the models. RESULTS: All childhood BDE-153 concentrations were inversely associated with reading scores at 5 and 8years, but associations were not statistically significant after covariate adjustment. For example, a 10-fold increase in BDE-153 concentrations at ages 3 and 5years was associated with a -5.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): -11.0, 1.0) and -5.5 (95% CI: -12.5, 1.4) point change in Basic Reading score at age 5years, respectively. Similarly, the estimates for Brief Reading score at age 5years were -4.5 (95% CI: -10.5, 1.5) and -5.2 (95% CI: -12.2, 1.7) point changes, respectively. Serum concentration of BDE-47, -99, -100, and Sum4PBDEs (sum of BDE-47, 99, 100, and 153) at every age were inversely associated with reading scores at ages 5 and 8years in unadjusted analyses. While the adjusted estimates were much attenuated and became non-significant, the direction of most of the associations was not altered. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown a suggestive but non-significant trend of inverse associations between childhood PBDE serum concentrations, particularly BDE-153, and children's reading skills. Future studies with a larger sample size are needed to examine these associations.","1873-6750:Liang, Hong:Vuong, Ann M:Xie, Changchun:Webster, Glenys M:Sjodin, Andreas:Yuan, Wei:Miao, Maohua:Braun, Joseph M:Dietrich, Kim N:Yolton, Kimberly:Lanphear, Bruce P:Chen, Aimin:P01 ES011261/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:P30 ES006096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:R01 ES014575/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:R01 ES028277/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:T32 ES010957/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:R01 ES020349/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:R01 ES024381/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States:Journal Article:Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural:Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't:Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.:Netherlands:Environ Int. 2019 Jan;122:330-339. doi: 10.1016/j.envint.2018.11.026.

Persons having outdoor professions are more likely than others to be exposed to F. tularensis through increased contact with arthropods, infected animals, and contaminated aerosols. Materials and Methods: After a tularemia epizootic during July and August 2015 at Devils Tower National Monument and an associated tularemia infection in a park employee, we assessed seroprevalence of F. tularensis antibodies, risk factors for F. tularensis seropositivity, and use of protective measures among park employees. Results: Seroprevalence among participating employees was 13% (3/23). Seropositive employees reported multiple risk factors for F. tularensis exposure through both job-related and recreational activities. Activities reported by more seropositive than seronegative employees included using a power blower (67% vs. 5%, p = 0.03), collecting animal carcasses (100% vs. 30%, p = 0.047), and hunting prairie dogs recreationally (67% vs. 5%, p = 0.03). Seropositive employees reported exposure to more ticks (median 30, range 25-35) than seronegative employees (median 6, range 0-25, p = 0.001). Most employees used protective measures (e.g., insect repellent) inconsistently but increased use after receiving educational materials. Conclusions: Educating and enabling at-risk employees to use protective measures consistently, both at work and during recreational activities, can reduce exposure during epizootics.","1557-7759:Harrist, Alexia:Cherry, Cara:Kwit, Natalie:Bryan, Katie:Pappert, Ryan:Petersen, Jeannine:Buttke, Danielle:Wong, David:Nelson, Christina:Journal Article:United States:Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2019 May;19(5):316-322. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2018.2360.

Gonorrhea may only be acquired when there is contact between infected and uninfected anatomical sites. With 3 sites of infection, this leads to 7 plausible routes of men who have sex with men (MSM) transmission: urethra-to-rectum, rectum-to-urethra, urethra-to-oropharynx, rectum-to-oropharynx, oropharynx-to-urethra, oropharynx-to-rectum, and oropharynx-to-oropharynx. We characterize the uncertainty and potential importance of transmission from each anatomical site using a deterministic compartmental mathematical model. METHODS: We developed a model of site-specific gonococcal infection, where individuals are infected at 0, 1, 2, or all 3 sites. Sexual behavior and infection duration parameters were fixed similar to a recent model analysis of Australian MSM. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample the posterior distribution of transmission probabilities that were consistent with site-specific prevalence in American MSM populations under specific scenarios. Scenarios were defined by whether transmission routes may or may not transmit by constraining specific transmission probabilities to zero rather than fitting them. RESULTS: Transmission contributions from each site have greater uncertainty when more routes may transmit; in the most extreme case, when all routes may transmit, the oropharynx can contribute 0% to 100% of all transmissions. In contrast, when only anal or oral sex may transmit, transmission from the oropharynx can account for only 0% to 25% of transmission. Intervention effectiveness against transmission from each site also has greater uncertainty when more routes may transmit. CONCLUSIONS: Even under ideal conditions (ie, when site-specific gonococcal prevalence, relative rates of specific sex acts, and duration of infection at each anatomical site are known and do not vary), the relative importance of different anatomical sites for gonococcal infection transmission cannot be inferred with precision. Additional data informing per act transmissibility are needed to understand site-specific gonococcal infection transmission. This understanding is essential for predicting population-specific intervention effectiveness.","1537-4521:Spicknall, Ian H:Mayer, Kenneth H:Aral, Sevgi O:Romero-Severson, Ethan O:Journal Article:United States:Sex Transm Dis. 2019 May;46(5):321-328. doi: 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000953.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30516722","Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and The Fenway Institute, Fenway Health, Boston, MA.:Division of STD Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/olq.0000000000000953"

RESULTS: From 2001 to 2016, 553 imported measles cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A median of 28 importations occurred each year (range: 18-80). The median age of imported case-patients was 18 years (range: 3 months-75 years); 87% were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.

Overall, 62% of all imported case-patients reported travel to countries in the Western Pacific and European Regions of the World Health Organization during their exposure periods. The number of measles importations from specific countries was related to the incidence of measles in and the volume of travel to and from the source country.

METHODS: Between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014, HIV-positive remnant dried blood spots collected from children under 18 months of age for Early Infant Diagnosis at the National Public Health Laboratory were used for HIV-1 genotyping. HIV drug resistance mutations were analyzed using the Stanford Drug Resistance HIVdb program. RESULTS: Of the 3555 dried blood spots collected for Early Infant Diagnosis, 360 (10.1%) were HIV-positive and 355 were available for genotyping. Of these, 304 (85.6%) were successfully genotyped and 217 (71.4%) had >/=1 drug resistance mutation. Mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) and non-NRTIs were present in 40.5% (123) and 69.1% (210), respectively. The most frequent mutations were K103N/S (48.0%), M184V (37.5%), G190A/S (15.1%), and Y181C/G/V (14.1%). Predicted drug resistance analysis revealed that 68.8% of the children had high-level resistance to non-NRTIs and 11.5% had intermediate to high-level resistance to abacavir. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed high rates of resistance to NRTIs and non-NRTIs among newly HIV-diagnosed children in Haiti, suggesting that in the era of ""Option B+"" (initiation of lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy to pregnant women with HIV), the majority of children who acquire HIV infection through mother-to-child transmission of HIV have resistant HIV.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of providers in public-sector health centers and office-based physicians (n = 2056) during 2013-2014. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of considering ""Quick Start"" initiation of LARC for adolescents as safe was 70.9% for implants and 64.5% for intrauterine devices (IUDs). Among public-sector providers, those not trained in implant or IUD insertion had lower odds of perceiving the practice safe (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.41 for implants; aOR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.32-0.55 for IUDs), whereas those practicing at health centers that did not receive Title X funding had lower odds of perceiving the practice safe for IUDs (aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98). Among office-based physicians, lack of training in LARC insertion was associated with lower odds of perceiving ""Quick Start"" initiation to be safe for IUDs (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.77).

All but 1 case-patient had recurrent fever, and some had marked laboratory abnormalities, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated aminotransaminases. One patient had uveitis. Diagnosis was delayed in 5 of the cases; all case-patients responded to therapy with doxycycline. Two patients had Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. The White Mountains of Arizona have not been previously considered a region of high incidence for TBRF. These 6 cases likely represent a larger number of cases that might have been undiagnosed.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search and a selective narrative review of publications in PubMed from 1966 to December 2017. We extracted study characteristics, including the workers' professions, workplace settings and shift work, and workplace interventions focused on worker sleep. Because of the high degree of heterogeneity in design and outcomes, we conducted a narrative review. RESULTS: We identified 219 publications. After restriction to publications with studies of workplace interventions that evaluated the outcomes of sleep duration or quality, we focused on 47 articles. An additional 13 articles were accepted in the pearling process. Most studies employed non-randomized or controlled pretest and posttest designs and self-reported measures of sleep. The most common workplace interventions were educational programs stressing sleep hygiene or fatigue management. Other interventions included timed napping before or after work, urging increased daytime activity levels, modifying workplace environmental characteristics such as lighting, and screening, and referral for sleep disorders treatment. Overall, most reports indicated that employer efforts to encourage improved sleep hygiene and healthier habits result in improvements in sleep duration, sleep quality, and self-reported sleepiness complaints. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest employer-sponsored efforts can improve sleep and sleep-related outcomes. The existing evidence, although weak, suggests efforts by employers to encourage better sleep habits and general fitness result in self-reported improvements in sleep-related outcomes, and may be associated with reduced absenteeism and better overall quality of life. Candidate workplace strategies to promote sleep health are provided.","1550-9397:Redeker, Nancy S:Caruso, Claire C:Hashmi, Sarah D:Mullington, Janet M:Grandner, Michael:Morgenthaler, Timothy I:Journal Article:United States:J Clin Sleep Med. 2019 Apr 15;15(4):649-657. doi: 10.5664/jcsm.7734.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30952228","Yale School of Nursing, Orange, Connecticut.:National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cincinnati, Ohio.:American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Darien, Illinois.:Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.:University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona.:Center for Sleep Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.5664/jcsm.7734"

This study was conducted to determine the economic impact of the MERS outbreak on the tourism and travel-related service sectors, including accommodation, food and beverage, and transportation, in the ROK. We projected monthly numbers of noncitizen arrivals and indices of services for 3 travel-related service sectors during and after the MERS outbreak (June 2015 to June 2016) using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. Tourism losses were estimated by multiplying the monthly differences between projected and actual numbers of noncitizen arrivals by average tourism expenditure per capita. Estimated tourism losses were allocated to travel-related service sectors to understand the distribution of losses across service sectors. The MERS outbreak was correlated with a reduction of 2.1 million noncitizen visitors corresponding with US$2.6 billion in tourism loss for the ROK. Estimated losses in the accommodation, food and beverage service, and transportation sectors associated with the decrease of noncitizen visitors were US$542 million, US$359 million, and US$106 million, respectively. The losses were demonstrated by lower than expected indices of services for the accommodation and food and beverage service sectors in June and July 2015 and for the transportation sector in June 2015.

We investigated factors associated with unintended index pregnancy, unmet contraceptive need, future pregnancy intention and current contraceptive use among Malawian women living with HIV in the Option B+ era. METHODS: Women who tested HIV positive at 4-26 weeks postpartum were enrolled into a cross-sectional study at high-volume Under-5 clinics. Structured baseline interviews included questions on socio-demographics, HIV knowledge, partner's HIV status/disclosure, ART use, pregnancy intention and contraceptive use. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: We enrolled 578 HIV-positive women between May 2015-May 2016; median maternal age was 28 years (y) (interquartile-range [IQR]: 23-32), median parity was 3 deliveries (IQR: 2-4) and median infant age was 7 weeks (IQR: 6-12). Overall, 41.8% women reported unintended index pregnancy, of whom 35.0% reported unmet contraceptive need and 65.0% contraceptive failure. In multivariable analysis, unintended index pregnancy was higher in >/=35y vs. 14-24y (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 2.1, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 1.0-4.2) and in women with parity >/=3 vs. primiparous (aOR: 2.9, 95%CI: 1.5-5.6). Unmet contraceptive need at conception was higher in 14-24y vs. >/=35y (aOR: 4.2, 95%CI: 1.8-9.9), primiparous vs. >/=3 (aOR: 8.3, 95%CI: 1.8-39.5), and women with a partner of unknown HIV-status (aOR: 2.2, 95%CI: 1.2-4.0). Current contraceptive use was associated with being on ART in previous pregnancy (aOR: 2.5, 95%CI: 1.5-3.9). CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of unintended index pregnancy and unmet contraceptive need among HIV-positive women highlight the need for improved access to contraceptives. To help achieve reproductive goals and elimination of MTCT of HIV, integration of family planning into HIV care should be strengthened to ensure women have timely access to a wide range of family planning methods with low failure risk.","1932-6203:Thindwa, Deus:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4845-7862:Landes, Megan:Lettow, Monique van:Kanyemba, Annie:Nkhoma, Ernest:Phiri, Happy:Kalua, Thokozani:Oosterhout, Joep J van:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3441-0804:Kim, Evelyn J:Barr, Beth A Tippett:NEMAPP Consortium:U2G GH000721/GH/CGH CDC HHS/United States:Journal Article:United States:PLoS One. 2019 Apr 23;14(4):e0215947. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0215947. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013338","Management Sciences for Health, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Dignitas International, Zomba, Malawi.:Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.:Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.:Department of HIV, Ministry of Health, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre, Malawi.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lilongwe, Malawi.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0215947"

The audiological evaluation included a questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry, acoustic immittance tests, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR) and P300 auditory-evoked potentials. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 77 Brazilian gasoline station workers were evaluated, and their results were compared with those of 36 participants who were not exposed to chemicals or noise at work. The gasoline station employees worked in 18 different gas stations, and the noise area measurements from all gas stations revealed time-weighted averages below 85 dBA. RESULTS: Of the 77 gasoline station workers evaluated, 67.5% had audiometric results within the normal range, but 59.7% reported difficulties in communication in noisy places. Gasoline station workers showed significantly poorer results than non-exposed control participants in one or more conditions of each of the audiological tests used, except P300.

We mapped exposure pathways by which distribution of oral vaccines may result in inoculation into people and applied a Markov chain to estimate the number of severe adverse events. We simulated three oral rabies vaccination (ORV) campaigns: (1) first generation ORV (SAD-B19) in foxes, (2) SAD-B19 in dogs, and (3) third generation ORV (SPBN GASGAS) in dogs. The risk of SAD-B19-associated human deaths was predicted to be low (0.18 per 10 million baits, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.36) when distributed to foxes, but, consistent with international concern, 19 times greater (3.35 per 10 million baits, 95% CI: 2.83, 3.98) when distributed to dogs. We simulated no deaths from SPBN GAS-GAS. Human deaths during dog campaigns were particularly sensitive to dog bite rate, and during wildlife campaigns to animal consumption rate and human contact rate with unconsumed baits.

Despite its importance, the biological factors underpinning chronic malaria are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that host metabolic state can influence malaria pathogenesis and transmission, but its role in chronicity is not known. Here, with the goal of identifying distinct modifications in the metabolite profiles of acute versus chronic malaria, metabolomics was performed on plasma from Plasmodium-infected humans and nonhuman primates with a range of parasitemias and clinical signs. In rhesus macaques infected with Plasmodium coatneyi, significant alterations in amines, carnitines, and lipids were detected during a high parasitemic acute phase and many of these reverted to baseline levels once a low parasitemic chronic phase was established. Plasmodium gene expression, studied in parallel in the macaques, revealed transcriptional changes in amine, fatty acid, lipid and energy metabolism genes, as well as variant antigen genes. Furthermore, a common set of amines, carnitines, and lipids distinguished acute from chronic malaria in plasma from human Plasmodium falciparum cases. In summary, distinct host-parasite metabolic environments have been uncovered that characterize acute versus chronic malaria, providing insights into the underlying host-parasite biology of malaria disease progression.","2379-3708:Cordy, Regina Joice:Patrapuvich, Rapatbhorn:Lili, Loukia N:Cabrera-Mora, Monica:Chien, Jung-Ting:Tharp, Gregory K:Khadka, Manoj:Meyer, Esmeralda Vs:Lapp, Stacey A:Joyner, Chester J:Garcia, AnaPatricia:Banton, Sophia:Tran, ViLinh:Luvira, Viravarn:Rungin, Siriwan:Saeseu, Teerawat:Rachaphaew, Nattawan:Pakala, Suman B:DeBarry, Jeremy D:MaHPIC Consortium:Kissinger, Jessica C:Ortlund, Eric A:Bosinger, Steven E:Barnwell, John W:Jones, Dean P:Uppal, Karan:Li, Shuzhao:Sattabongkot, Jetsumon:Moreno, Alberto:Galinski, Mary R:Journal Article:United States:JCI Insight. 2019 May 2;4(9). pii: 125156. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.125156. eCollection 2019 May 2.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31045574","Emory Vaccine Center and Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Department of Biology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.:Mahidol Vivax Research Unit, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.:Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Institute for Next Generation Healthcare, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.:Emory Integrated Lipidomics Core, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.:Institute of Bioinformatics.:Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, and.:Department of Genetics, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA.:Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Malaria Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1172/jci.insight.125156"

Implied in that goal is that viral load be quantified for all patients receiving treatment, which is a challenging undertaking given the complexity and high cost of standard-of-care viral load testing methods. Recently developed point-of-care viral load testing devices offer new promise to improve access to viral load testing by bringing the test closer to the patient and also returning results faster, often same-day. While manufactures have evaluated point-of-care assays using reference panels, empiric data examining the impact of the new technology against standard-of-care monitoring in low- and middle-income settings are lacking. Our goal in this trial is to compare a point-of-care to standard-of-care viral load test on impact on various clinical outcomes as well to assess the acceptability and feasibility of using the assay in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Using a two-arm randomized control trial design, we will enroll 794 patients from two different HIV treatment sites in Nigeria. Patients will be randomized 1:1 for point-of-care or standard-of-care viral load monitoring (397 patients per arm). Following initiation of treatment, viral load will be monitored at patients' 6- and 12-month follow-up visits using either point-of-care or standard-of-care testing methods, based on trial assignment. The monitoring schedule will follow national treatment guidelines. The primary outcome measure in this trial is proportion of patients with viral suppression at month 12 post-initiation of treatment. The secondary outcome measures encompass acceptability, feasibility, and virologic impact variables. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will provide information on the impact of using point-of-care versus standard-of-care viral load testing on patient clinical outcomes; the study will also supply data on the acceptability and feasibility of point-of-care viral load monitoring in a resource-limited setting. If this method of testing is acceptable and feasible, and also superior to standard of care, the results of the trial and the information gathered will inform future scaled implementation and further optimization of the clinic-laboratory network that is critical for monitoring achievement of the 90-90-90 goals.

During the Oklahoma (USA) May 2013 tornadoes, Oklahoma State Health Department Division of Vital Records (VR; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma USA) piloted a flagging procedure to track tornado-attributed deaths within its Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS). To determine if the EDRS was capturing all tornado-attributed deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) evaluated three event fatality markers (EFM), which are used to collate information about deaths for immediate response and retrospective research efforts. METHODS: Oklahoma identified 48 tornado-attributed deaths through a retrospective review of hospital morbidity and mortality records. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) analyzed the sensitivity, timeliness, and validity for three EFMs, which included: (1) a tornado-specific flag on the death record; (2) a tornado-related term in the death certificate; and (3) X37, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code in the death record for Victim of a Cataclysmic Storm, which includes tornadoes. RESULTS: The flag was the most sensitive EFM (89.6%; 43/48), followed by the tornado term (75.0%; 36/48), and the X37 code (56.2%; 27/48). The most-timely EFM was the flag, which took 2.0 median days to report (range 0-10 days), followed by the tornado term (median 3.5 days; range 1-21), and the X37 code (median &gt;10 days; range 2-122). Over one-half (52.1%; 25/48) of the tornado-attributed deaths were missing at least one EFM. Twenty-six percent (11/43) of flagged records had no tornado term, and 44.1% (19/43) had no X37 code. Eleven percent (4/36) of records with a tornado term did not have a flag. CONCLUSION: The tornado-specific flag was the most sensitive and timely EFM. Using the flag to collate death records and identify additional deaths without the tornado term and X37 code may improve immediate response and retrospective investigations. Moreover, each of the EFMs can serve as quality controls for the others to maximize capture of all disaster-attributed deaths from vital statistics records in the EDRS.Issa AN, Baker K, Pate D, Law R, Bayleyegn T, Noe RS.

Measles is a highly contagious, acute viral illness characterized by fever and a maculopapular rash; complications include pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Among the 704 cases, 503 (71%) were in unvaccinated persons and 689 (98%) occurred in U.S. residents. Overall, 66 (9%) patients were hospitalized. Thirteen outbreaks have been reported in 2019, accounting for 663 cases, 94% of all reported cases. Six of the 13 outbreaks were associated with underimmunized close-knit communities and accounted for 88% of all cases. High 2-dose measles vaccination coverage in the United States has been critical to limiting transmission (3). However, increased global measles activity poses a risk to U.S. elimination, particularly when unvaccinated travelers acquire measles abroad and return to communities with low vaccination rates (4). Health care providers should ensure persons are up to date with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, including before international travel, and rapidly report all suspected cases of measles to public health authorities.","1545-861x:Patel, Manisha:Lee, Adria D:Redd, Susan B:Clemmons, Nakia S:McNall, Rebecca J:Cohn, Amanda C:Gastanaduy, Paul A:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 May 3;68(17):402-404. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6817e1.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048672",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6817e1"

The WHO-recommended elimination strategies in EUR include 1) achieving and maintaining >/=95% coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) through routine immunization services; 2) providing measles and rubella vaccination opportunities, including supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), to populations susceptible to measles or rubella; 3) strengthening surveillance by conducting case investigations and confirming suspected cases and outbreaks with laboratory results; and 4) improving the availability and use of evidence for the benefits and risks associated with vaccination (3). This report updates a previous report (4) and describes progress toward measles elimination in EUR during 2009-2018. During 2009-2017, estimated regional coverage with the first MCV dose (MCV1) was 93%-95%, and coverage with the second dose (MCV2) increased from 73% to 90%. In 2017, 30 (57%) countries achieved >/=95% MCV1 coverage, and 15 (28%) achieved >/=95% coverage with both doses.

Measles incidence declined to 5.8 per 1 million population in 2016, but increased to 89.5 in 2018, because of large outbreaks in several EUR countries. To achieve measles elimination in EUR, measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs by ensuring >/=95% 2-dose MCV coverage in every district of each country, offering supplemental measles vaccination to susceptible adults, maintaining high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensuring effective outbreak preparedness and response.","1545-861x:Zimmerman, Laura A:Muscat, Mark:Singh, Simarjit:Ben Mamou, Myriam:Jankovic, Dragan:Datta, Siddhartha:Alexander, James P:Goodson, James L:O'Connor, Patrick:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 May 3;68(17):396-401. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6817a4.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048675",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6817a4"

Drug overdose deaths involving cocaine, psychostimulants with abuse potential (psychostimulants), or both substances combined increased 42.4% from 12,122 in 2015 to 17,258 in 2016.* Psychostimulants with abuse potential include drugs such as methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), dextroamphetamine, levoamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), and caffeine. From 2015 to 2016, cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates increased 52.4% and 33.3%, respectively (1). A total of 70,237 persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2017; approximately two thirds of these deaths involved an opioid (2). CDC analyzed 2016-2017 changes in age-adjusted death rates involving cocaine and psychostimulants by demographic characteristics, urbanization levels, U.S. Census region, 34 states, and the District of Columbia (DC). CDC also examined trends in age-adjusted cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved death rates from 2003 to 2017 overall, as well as with and without co-involvement of opioids. Among all 2017 drug overdose deaths, 13,942 (19.8%) involved cocaine, and 10,333 (14.7%) involved psychostimulants. Death rates increased from 2016 to 2017 for both drug categories across demographic characteristics, urbanization levels, Census regions, and states. In 2017, opioids were involved in 72.7% and 50.4% of cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved overdoses, respectively, and the data suggest that increases in cocaine-involved overdose deaths from 2012 to 2017 were driven primarily by synthetic opioids. Conversely, increases in psychostimulant-involved deaths from 2010 to 2017 occurred largely independent of opioids, with increased co-involvement of synthetic opioids in recent years. Provisional data from 2018 indicate that deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants are continuing to increase.(dagger) Increases in stimulant-involved deaths are part of a growing polysubstance landscape. Increased surveillance and evidence-based multisectoral prevention and response strategies are needed to address deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants and opioids.

We partnered with the government ministries responsible for human, animal, and environmental health to identify a list of zoonotic diseases - rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, trypanosomiasis and highly pathogenic avian influenza - as the country's top priorities. We used each priority disease as a case study to identify existing processes for prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, laboratory confirmation, reporting and response across the three ministries. Results were used to produce disease-specific systems ""maps"" emphasizing linkages across the systems, as well as opportunities for improvement. We identified brucellosis as a particularly neglected condition. Past efforts to build avian influenza capabilities, which had degraded substantially in less than a decade, highlighted the challenge of sustainability. We observed a keen interest across sectors to reinvigorate national rabies control, and given the regional and global support for One Health approaches to rabies elimination, rabies could serve as an ideal disease to test incipient One Health coordination mechanisms and procedures. Overall, we identified five major categories of gaps and challenges: (1) Coordination; (2) Training; (3) Infrastructure; (4) Public Awareness; and (5) Research. We developed and prioritized recommendations to address the gaps, estimated the level of resource investment needed, and estimated a timeline for implementation. These prioritized recommendations can be used by the Government of Guinea to plan strategically for future One Health efforts, ideally under the auspices of the national One Health Platform. This work demonstrates an effective methodology for mapping systems and structures for zoonotic diseases, and the benefit of conducting a baseline review of systemic capabilities prior to embarking on capacity building efforts.","Standley, Claire J:Carlin, Ellen P:Sorrell, Erin M:Barry, Alpha M:Bile, Ebi:Diakite, Aboubacar S:Keita, Mamady S:Koivogui, Lamine:Mane, Seny:Martel, Lise D:Katz, Rebecca:Journal Article:Netherlands:One Health. 2019 Apr 16;7:100093. doi: 10.1016/j.onehlt.2019.100093. eCollection 2019 Jun.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049389","Center for Global Health Science and Security, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States.:EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY, United States.:U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Conakry, Guinea.:Ministry of Health, Conakry, Guinea.:Ministry of Environment, Conakry, Guinea.:Institut National de Sante Publique, Conakry, Guinea.:Ministry of Livestock, Conakry, Guinea.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1016/j.onehlt.2019.100093"

METHODS: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on surveillance system evaluation were used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate IS. Interviews with key stakeholders focused on IS's usefulness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, and stability. Active case finding of 2014 road traffic deaths in all paper and electronic hospital record systems was used to assess system sensitivity, positive predictive value, and data quality. Electronic data matching software was used to determine the implications of combining IS data with other provincial-level data sources (e.g., death certificates, electronic vehicle insurance claim system). RESULTS: Evaluation results indicated that IS was useful, flexible, acceptable, and stable, with a high positive predictive value (99%). Simplicity was limited due to the burden of collecting data on all injuries and use of paper-based data collection forms. Sensitivity was low, with IS only identifying 55% of hospital road traffic death cases identified during active case finding; however, IS cases were representative of cases identified. Data accuracy and completeness varied across data fields. Combining IS with active case finding, death certificates, and the electronic vehicle insurance claim system more than doubled the number of road traffic death cases identified in Phuket. CONCLUSION: An efficient and comprehensive road traffic injury and death surveillance system is critical for monitoring Phuket's road traffic burden. The hospital-based IS system is a useful system for monitoring road traffic deaths and assessing risk behaviors. However, the complexity of data collection and limited coverage hinders the ability of IS to fully represent road traffic deaths in Phuket Province. Combining data sources could improve coverage and should be considered.","1538-957x:Nittayasoot, Natthaprang:Peterson, Alexis B:Thammawijaya, Panithee:Parker, Erin M:Sathawornwiwat, Apichit:Boonthanapat, Naris:Chantian, Thanawadee:Voradetwitaya, Lujisak:Jiraphongsa, Chuleeporn:Sagarasaeranee, Onpirun:Sansilapin, Chalo:Rattanathamsakul, Thanit:Ketgudee, Lalida:Tantiworrawit, Patcharin:Journal Article:England:Traffic Inj Prev. 2019 May 3:1-7. doi: 10.1080/15389588.2019.1581924.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050566","a Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control , Ministry of Public Health , Thailand.:b Epidemic Intelligence Service , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia.:c Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia.:d Division of Analysis, Research, and Practice Integration , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia.:e United States Public Health Service, Atlanta, Georgia.:f Ministry of Public Health, Chaloem Prakiat Hospital , Nan Province , Thailand.:g Thailand Ministry of Public Health-U.S. CDC Collaboration , Nonthaburi , Thailand.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1080/15389588.2019.1581924"

We describe the development of the web-based CAT, evaluate the quality of the data obtained, and discuss lessons learned. METHODS: We developed and refined a web-based CAT to collect 5 years (2009-2014) of cost data from 29 CRCCP grantees. We analyzed funding distribution; costs by budget categories; distribution of costs related to screening promotion, screening provision, and overarching activities; and reporting of screenings for grantees that received funding from non-CDC sources compared with those grantees that did not. RESULTS: CDC provided 85.6% of the resources for the CRCCP, with smaller amounts from in-kind contributions (7.8%), and funding from other sources (6.6%) (eg, state funding). Grantees allocated, on average, 95% of their expenditures to specific program activities and 5% to other activities. Some non-CDC funds were used to provide screening tests to additional people, and these additional screens were captured in the CAT. CONCLUSION: A web-based tool can be successfully used to collect cost data on expenditures associated with CRCCP activities. Areas for future refinement include how to collect and allocate dollars from other sources in addition to CDC dollars.","1545-1151:Hoover, Sonja:Subramanian, Sujha:Tangka, Florence:Journal Article:United States:Prev Chronic Dis. 2019 May 2;16:E54. doi: 10.5888/pcd16.180336.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050637","RTI International, Waltham, Massachusetts.:307 Waverley Oaks Rd, Suite 101, Waltham, MA 02452.

METHODS: We used matched interview and medical record abstraction data from the 2009-2012 data cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project, a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults in care. We included men and women aged 50-64 and >/=65 years at time of interview. We calculated weighted prevalence estimates and used logistic regression to compute adjusted prevalence differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) assessing sex differences in various characteristics and cardiovascular comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions included overweight/obesity (body mass index >/=25), abnormal total cholesterol level (defined as >/=200 mg/dL), diagnosed diabetes mellitus, or diagnosed hypertension. RESULTS: Of 7436 participants, 89.5% were aged 50-64 years and 10.4% aged >/=65 years, 75.1% were men, 40.4% (95% CI, 33.5%-47.2%) were non-Hispanic black, 72.0% (70.4%-73.6%) had HIV infection diagnosed >/=10 years earlier. After adjustment for sociodemographic and behavioral factors, women aged 50-64 years were more likely than men to be obese (adjusted prevalence difference, 8.4; 95% CI, 4.4-12.3), have hypertension (3.9; .1-7.6), or have high total cholesterol levels (9.9; 6.2-13.6). Women aged >/=65 years had higher prevalences of diabetes mellitus and high total cholesterol levels than men. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular comorbid conditions were prevalent among older HIV-infected persons in care; disparities existed by sex.

However, studies assessing risk factors for ARI-related deaths in low- and middle-income settings are limited. We describe ARI-related death and associated factors among children aged < 2 years and adults aged >/=18 years hospitalized with ARI in Guatemala. METHODS: We used respiratory illness surveillance data in Guatemala from 2007 to 2013. ARI was defined as evidence of acute infection and >/= 1 sign/symptom of respiratory disease in hospitalized patients. Clinical, sociodemographic, and follow-up data were gathered. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with ARI and tested for 6 respiratory viruses; urine was collected only from adults with ARI and tested for pneumococcal antigen. Blood cultures and chest radiographs were performed at the physician's discretion. Radiographs were interpreted per World Health Organization guidelines to classify endpoint pneumonia (i.e. suggestive of bacterial pneumonia). Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare characteristics of patients with fatal cases, including those who died in-hospital or were discharged in a moribund state, with those of patients with non-fatal cases. RESULTS: Among 4109 ARI cases identified in hospitalized children < 2 years old, 174 (4%) were fatal. Median age at admission was 4 and 6 months for children with fatal and non-fatal cases, respectively. Factors associated with fatality included low weight-for-age, low family income, heart disease, and endpoint pneumonia; breastfeeding and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection were negatively associated with fatality. Among 1517 ARI cases identified in hospitalized adults >/=18 years, 181 (12%) episodes were fatal. Median age at admission was 57 years for adults with fatal and non-fatal cases. Low body mass index, male sex, kidney disease, and endpoint pneumonia were significantly more common among patients with fatal versus non-fatal cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight some of the factors that must be addressed in order to reduce ARI-related mortality, including promotion of good nutrition, breastfeeding, management and prevention of chronic comorbidities, and poverty reduction. Although no specific pathogen increased risk for death, endpoint pneumonia was significantly associated with fatality, suggesting that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine could contribute to future reductions in ARI-related mortality.","1471-2458:Tomczyk, Sara:McCracken, John P:Contreras, Carmen Lucia:Lopez, Maria Renee:Bernart, Chris:Moir, Juan Carlos:Escobar, Kenneth:Reyes, Lisette:Arvelo, Wences:Lindblade, Kim:Peruski, Leonard:Bryan, Joe P:Verani, Jennifer R:Journal Article:England:BMC Public Health. 2019 May 3;19(1):499. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-6824-z.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053069","Division of Global Health Protection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA.:Center for Health Studies, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala. jmccracken@ces.uvg.edu.gt.:Center for Health Studies, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala.:Quetzaltenango Health Area, Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.:Western Regional Hospital San Juan de Dios, Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.:Santa Rosa Health Area, Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare, Cuilapa, Guatemala.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12889-019-6824-z"

Historically, A/H3 predominant seasons have been associated with more severe influenza-associated disease; however, since the 2009 pandemic there are suggestions that some birth cohorts experience more severe illness in A/H1 predominant seasons. METHODS: U.S. influenza virologic, hospitalization and mortality surveillance data during 2000-2017 were analyzed for cohorts born between 1918 and 1989 that likely had different initial influenza virus exposures based on viruses circulating during early childhood. Relative risk/rate during H3 compared to H1 predominant seasons during pre-pandemic versus pandemic and later periods were calculated for each cohort. RESULTS: During the pre-pandemic period, all cohorts had more influenza-associated disease during H3 predominant seasons than H1 predominant seasons. During the pandemic and later period, four cohorts had higher hospitalization and mortality rates during H1 predominant seasons than H3 predominant seasons. DISCUSSION: Birth cohort differences in risk of influenza-associated disease by influenza A virus subtype can be seen in U.S. influenza surveillance data and differ between pre-pandemic and pandemic and later periods. As the population ages, the amount of influenza-associated disease may be greater in future H1 predominant seasons than H3 predominant seasons.","1537-6613:Budd, Alicia P:Beacham, Lauren:Smith, Catherine B:Garten, Rebecca J:Reed, Carrie:Kniss, Krista:Mustaquim, Desiree:Ahmad, Farida B:Cummings, Charisse N:Garg, Shikha:Levine, Min Z:Fry, Alicia M:Brammer, Lynnette:Journal Article:United States:J Infect Dis. 2019 May 3. pii: 5485579. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiz201.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053844","Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Battelle Memorial Institute, Suite, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/infdis/jiz201"

Description For 2008-2013, Ohio used de-identified hospital discharge records and International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify delivery hospitalizations. Massachusetts used existing linked data system infrastructure to identify delivery hospitalizations from birth certificates linked to hospital discharge records. To identify delivery hospitalizations complicated by one or more of 25 SMMs, both states applied an algorithm of ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes. Ohio calculated a 2013 SMM rate of 144 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations; Massachusetts calculated a rate of 162. Ohio observed no increase in the SMM rate from 2008 to 2013; Massachusetts observed a 33% increase. Both identified disparities in SMM rates by maternal race, age, and insurance type. Assessment Ohio and Massachusetts engaged stakeholders, including perinatal quality collaboratives and maternal mortality review committees, to share results and raise awareness about the SMM rates and identified high-risk populations. Both states are applying findings to inform strategies for improving perinatal outcomes, such as simulation training for obstetrical emergencies, licensure rules for maternity units, and a focus on health equity. Conclusion Despite data access differences, examination of SMM data informed public health practice in both states. Ohio and Massachusetts maximized available state data for SMM investigation, which other states might similarly use to understand trends, identify high risk populations, and suggest clinical or population level interventions to improve maternal morbidity and mortality.","1573-6628:Conrey, Elizabeth J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1376-1362:Manning, Susan E:Shellhaas, Cynthia:Somerville, Nicholas J:Stone, Sarah L:Diop, Hafsatou:Rankin, Kristin:Goodman, Dave:Journal Article:United States:Matern Child Health J. 2019 May 4. pii: 10.1007/s10995-019-02744-1. doi: 10.1007/s10995-019-02744-1.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055701","Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. elizabeth.conrey@odh.ohio.gov.:Ohio Department of Health, Columbus, OH, USA. elizabeth.conrey@odh.ohio.gov.:Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.:Ohio Department of Health, Columbus, OH, USA.:The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.:Epidemic Intelligence Service, Division of Applied Sciences, Scientific Education and Professional Development Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:CDC/CSTE Applied Epidemiology Fellowship Program, Atlanta, GA, USA.:University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1007/s10995-019-02744-1"

We analyzed 2013-2014 data from 1703 black women patients in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Medical Monitoring Project to examine whether select psychological and social determinants of health (SDH) factors were associated with ART adherence and viral suppression. We calculated weighted estimates and used multivariable logistic regression with adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to examine correlates of ART adherence and viral suppression. Women who had not been incarcerated in the past 12 months (aPR = 1.24; CI: 1.04-1.48) and had not experienced discrimination in a health care setting since their HIV diagnosis (aPR = 1.06; 1.00-1.11) were slightly more likely to be adherent to ART. Women who lived above the federal poverty level were more likely to be virally suppressed during the past 12 months (aPR = 1.09; CI: 1.01-1.18).

METHODS: In this study we used the nationally representative Household Income Expenditure Survey 2010 from Bangladesh. Detailed household-level food consumption data including both ethnic and region-specific foods were collected over 14 days, consisting of 7 visits each collecting two days of dietary recall information. RESULTS: Out of 12240 households, 2061 consumed smoking tobacco only (16.8%), 3284 consumed smokeless tobacco only (26.8%), and 3348 consumed both (27.4%). Overall, 71% of the households reported expenditure on tobacco (smoking and/or smokeless) and were considered any-tobacco use households. Our results indicate that after controlling for household expenditure, household size, household child to adult ratio, place of residence (urban/rural), and region fixed effects, any-tobacco households consumed significantly lower amounts (g/day) of milk and dairy products (beta = -17.11, p<0.01) and oil/fat (beta = -10.30, p<0.01) compared to tobacco non-use households (beta: adjusted mean difference in food amount g/day/household). Conversely, consumption of cereal grains (beta = 152.46, p<0.0001) and sugar (beta = 8.16, p<0.0001) were significantly higher among any-tobacco households compared to non-tobacco households. We observed similar patterns for smoking-only, smokeless-only, and dual tobacco product households. CONCLUSION: Evidence of dietary differences between tobacco-use and non-use households may play an important role in developing strategies to address poor diet and malnutrition among tobacco-use households in a developing country like Bangladesh. This study provides one of the first reports addressing diet in relation to tobacco use from a developing country, particularly using nationally representative data. The finding that tobacco-use households have poorer dietary consumption than non-use households suggests that it is important to address tobacco use in the context of nutrition and development programs in low-income environments.","Virk-Baker, Mandeep:Husain, Muhammad Jami:Parascandola, Mark:CC999999/Intramural CDC HHS/United States:Journal Article:Greece:Tob Prev Cessat. 2019 Mar;5:12. doi: 10.18332/tpc/105599.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058247","US National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, United States.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United States.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.18332/tpc/105599"

METHODS: Data from 250 lupus participants was analyzed across three sources (medical records, physician examination, and patient interviews). Overall performance on eight quality measures was calculated separately for participants with and without LN. We used generalized estimating equations in which the outcome was performance on measures, adjusting for participant demographics, lupus disease severity and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Of 148 patients without LN, 42% had screening labs for nephritis, 38% had lupus activity serologies and 81% had blood pressure checked every 6 months. Of 102 LN patients, 67% had a timely kidney biopsy, at least 81% had appropriate treatment and 78% achieved target blood pressure within 1 year of diagnosis. Overall performance in participants across quality measures was 54% (no LN) and 80% (LN). Significantly higher overall performance for screening measures for LN was seen at academic (63.4-73%) versus community clinics (37.9-38.4%). Similarly, among those with LN, higher performance in academic (84.1-85.2%) versus community clinics (54.8-60.2%) was observed for treatment measures. CONCLUSION: In this quality of care analysis across 25 diverse clinical settings, we found relatively high performance on measures for management of LN.

We assessed factors associated with anal precancer in HIV+ and at-risk HIV-negative (ARHIVN) women from the Atlanta Women's Interagency HIV Study Cohort. METHODS: All participants underwent high resolution anoscopy, anal cytology (AC) and had anal (AS) and cervical (CS) samples collected. Specimens were tested for 37 HPV types and for FAM19A4 and microRNA124-2 promoter methylation. Binary logistic regression and multivariate analysis were conducted with histologic anal high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (A-HSIL) as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Seventy-five women enrolled: 52(69%) were HIV+ with three-fourths having undetectable viral load, 64(86%) were black, with mean age 49+/-8 years. Forty-nine (65%) AC samples were abnormal, and 38(51%) of AS were positive for at least one of 13 high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types. Thirteen (18%) anal biopsies identified A-HSIL. Hypermethylation of FAM19A4 and/or microRNA124-2 was found in 69 (95%) AS and 19(26%) CS. In multivariate analyses, the odds of having A-HSIL were over 6 times higher in women with anal hrHPV (aOR 6.08, 95% CI 1.27-29.18, p=0.02) and with positive cervical methylation (aOR 6.49, 95% CI 1.66-25.35, p=0.007), but not significantly higher in women with positive anal methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Anal hrHPV and promoter hypermethylation in the cervix show promise as biomarkers for anal cancer screening in HIV+ and ARHIVN women.

The objective of our study was to examine the association between incarceration and HIV risk-related behaviors among a sample of predominantly non-Hispanic black and Hispanic heterosexual men residing in urban areas in the United States with a high prevalence of AIDS. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2013 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system on 5321 at-risk heterosexual men using log-linked Poisson regression models, adjusted for demographic characteristics and clustered on city. RESULTS: Of 5321 men, 1417 (26.6%) had recently been incarcerated (in the past 12 months), 2781 (52.3%) had ever been incarcerated but not in the past 12 months, and 1123 (21.1%) had never been incarcerated. Recent incarceration was associated with multiple casual female sexual partners (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.44), condomless sex with multiple female sexual partners (aPR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.66), injection drug use (aPR = 3.75; 95% CI, 2.64-5.32), and having sexual partners who were more likely to have ever injected drugs (aPR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.48-2.28), been incarcerated (aPR = 2.28; 95% CI, 2.01-2.59), or had a concurrent sexual partner (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.11), as compared with never-incarcerated men.

This study evaluated the quality of malaria service provision offered in public health facilities in Mozambique. METHODS: A cross-sectional assessment was conducted in April-May 2018 in three provinces of Mozambique: Maputo Province (low malaria burden), Cabo Delgado (high), and Zambezia (high). The study included all secondary and tertiary facilities and a random sample of primary facilities in each province. Data collection included exit interviews and re-examinations of 20 randomly selected outpatient service patients, interviews with up to five health care providers and the health facility director, a stockroom inventory and routine data abstraction. RESULTS: A total of 319 health care providers and 1840 patients from 117 health facilities were included. Of these, 1325 patients (72%) had suspected malaria (fever/history of fever) and 550 (30%) had febrile, confirmed malaria with the highest burden in Cabo Delgado (43%), followed by Zambezia (34%) and Maputo Province (2%). Appropriate management of malaria cases, defined as testing malaria suspects and treating confirmed cases with the correct dose of anti-malarial, was highest in Zambezia and Cabo Delgado where 52% (95% CI 42-62) and 49% (42-57) of febrile malaria cases were appropriately managed, respectively. Only 14% (5-34) of febrile cases in Maputo Province were appropriately managed. The biggest gap in the malaria case management pathway was failure to test febrile patients, with only 46% of patients with this indication tested for malaria in Maputo Province. Additionally, anti-malarial treatment of patients with a negative malaria test result was common, ranging from 8% (2-23) in Maputo Province to 22% (14-32) of patients with a negative test in Zambezia. Only 58-62% of patients prescribed an anti-malarial correctly recited dosing instructions. Provider training and malaria knowledge was low outside of Zambezia and supervision rates were low in all provinces. Factors associated with correct case management varied by province and included patient age, facility type, treatment and testing availability, supervision, and training. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the need to strengthen provider testing of all patients with fever, provider adherence to negative test results, and effective counselling of patients across epidemiological settings in Mozambique.","1475-2875:Candrinho, Baltazar:Plucinski, Mateusz M:Colborn, James M:da Silva, Mariana:Mathe, Guidion:Dimene, Mercia:Chico, Ana Rita:Castel-Branco, Ana Christina:Brito, Frederico:Andela, Marcel:Ponce de Leon, Gabriel:Saifodine, Abuchahama:Zulliger, Rose:Journal Article:England:Malar J. 2019 May 6;18(1):162. doi: 10.1186/s12936-019-2796-9.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060605","National Malaria Control Programme, Ministry of Health, Maputo, Mozambique.:United States President's Malaria Initiative, Malaria Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Clinton Health Access Initiative, Maputo, Mozambique.:UNICEF, Maputo, Mozambique.:United States President's Malaria Initiative, United States Agency for International Development, Maputo, Mozambique.:United States President's Malaria Initiative, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Maputo, Mozambique. rzulliger@cdc.gov.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12936-019-2796-9"

Samples were tested by PCR for both Orthopoxviruses and varicella-zoster virus (VZV); a subset of VZV positive samples were genotyped. We defined a varicella case as a rash illness with laboratory-confirmed VZV. RESULTS: 366 varicella cases were identified; 66% were </=19 years old. Most patients had non-typical varicella rash with lesions reported as the same size and stage of evolution (86%), deep and profound (91%), on palms of hands and/or soles of feet (86%), and not itchy (49%). Many had non-typical signs and symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy (70%) and sensitivity to light (23%). A higher proportion of persons aged >/=20 years than persons aged </=19 years had >/=50 lesions (79% versus 65%, p = 0.007) and were bedridden (15% versus 9%, p = 0.056). All VZV isolates genotyped from 79 varicella cases were clade 5. During the surveillance period, one possible VZV-related death occurred in a 7 year-old child. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients presented with nontypical varicella rash and clinical signs and symptoms, highlighting challenges identifying varicella in an area with endemic monkeypox. Continued surveillance and laboratory diagnosis will help in rapid identification and control of both monkeypox and varicella and improve our understanding of varicella epidemiology in Africa.

In this retrospective observational study, we partition records of serotyped non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates from human clinical specimens reported to CDC national surveillance by demographic, geographic and seasonal characteristics and adapt sample-based rarefaction methods from the field of community ecology to study how Salmonella serotype diversity varied within and among these populations in the USA during 1996-2016. We observed substantially higher serotype richness in children &lt;2 years old than in older children and adults and steadily increasing richness with age among older adults. Whereas seasonal and regional variation in serotype diversity was highest among infants and young children, variation by specimen source was highest in adults. Our findings suggest that the risk for infection from uncommon serotypes is associated with host and environmental factors, particularly among infants, young children and older adults.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective-cohort study among 29,999 women enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northwest who completed GDM screening (two-step method:1-hour, 50-gram glucose-challenge test (GCT); 3-hour, 100-gram oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT)). Test results were categorized as normal GCT (referent, n=25,535), normal OGTT (n=2,246), abnormal OGTT but not GDM (n=1477), and GDM (n=741). Rate ratios (RRs) were calculated for utilization measures and analyses were age- and BMI-adjusted. RESULTS: Compared to women with normal GCT, rates for obstetrical ultrasound, noninvasive and invasive antenatal testing, and ambulatory visits to the obstetrics department were significantly greater among women with abnormal OGTT (RRs 1.2 [95%CI 1.1, 1.4], 1.3 [1.1, 1.4], 1.7 [1.3, 2.3], and 1.1 [1.1, 1.1], respectively) and GDM (RRs 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, and 1.3, respectively).

We investigated to identify the scope of the increase and risk factors for infection, evaluate health facilities' capacity to manage MDR-TB, and recommend evidence-based control measures. METHODS: We defined an MDR-TB case-patient as a TB patient attending Arua Regional Referral Hospital (ARRH) during 2013-2017 with a sputum sample yielding Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, confirmed by an approved drug susceptibility test. We reviewed clinical records from ARRH and compared the number of MDR-TB cases during January-August 2017 with the same months in 2013-2016. To identify risk factors specific for MDR-TB among cases with secondary infection, we conducted a case-control study using persons with drug-susceptible TB matched by sub-county of residence as controls. We observed infection prevention and control practices in health facilities and community, and assessed health facilities' capacity to manage TB. RESULTS: We identified 33 patients with MDR-TB, of whom 30 were secondary TB infection cases. The number of cases during January-August 2017 was 10, compared with 3-4 cases in January-August from 2013 to 2016 (p = 0.02). Men were more affected than women (6.5 vs 1.6/100,000, p < 0.01), as were cases >/=18 years old compared to those < 18 years (8.7 vs 0.21/100,000, p < 0.01). In the case-control study, poor adherence to first-line anti-TB treatment (aOR = 9.2, 95% CI: 2.3-37) and initiating treatment > 15 months from symptom onset (aOR = 11, 95% CI: 1.5-87) were associated with MDR-TB. All ten facilities assessed reported stockouts of TB commodities. All 15 ambulatory MDR-TB patients we observed were not wearing masks given to them to minimize community infection. The MDR-TB ward at ARRH capacity was 4 patients but there were 11 patients. CONCLUSION: The number of cases during January-August in 2017 was significantly higher than during the same months in 2013-2016. Poor adherence to TB drugs and delayed treatment initiation were associated with MDR-TB infection. We recommended strengthening directly-observed treatment strategy, increasing access to treatment services, and increasing the number of beds in the MDR-TB ward at ARRH.","1471-2334:Okethwangu, Denis:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8421-6359:Birungi, Doreen:Biribawa, Claire:Kwesiga, Benon:Turyahabwe, Stavia:Ario, Alex R:Zhu, Bao-Ping:GH001353-01/U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief:Journal Article:England:BMC Infect Dis. 2019 May 7;19(1):387. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4014-3.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31064332","Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program, Kampala, Uganda. dokethwangu@musph.ac.ug.:Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program, Kampala, Uganda.:National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program, Ministry of Health, Kampala, Uganda.:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kampala, Uganda.:Division of Global Health Protection, Center for Global Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12879-019-4014-3"

National HIV Behavioral Surveillance among Young Men Who Have Sex with Men (NHBS-YMSM) data among SMM aged 13-18 years were collected in three cities (Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia). Separate log-linked Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations between mental health issues and social support (general and family), and 3 HIV-related sexual risk behavior outcomes: past-year condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with a male partner, past-year sex with >/= 4 partners, and first vaginal or anal sex before age 13. Of 547 adolescent SMM, 22% reported ever attempting suicide and 10% reported past-month suicidal ideation. The majority (52%) reported depression and anxiety. Thirty-nine percent reported CAI, 29% reported >/= 4 sex partners and 22% reported first sex before age 13. Ever attempting suicide, suicidal ideation, and depression and anxiety were associated with CAI. Separately, ever attempting suicide and lack of family support were associated with >/= 4 sex partners. None of the mental health or support measures were associated with having sex before age 13. General social support was not associated with any sexual risk behaviors. Mental health issues are common among adolescent SMM and associated with sexual risk behaviors. Including mental health support in comprehensive HIV prevention for adolescent SMM could potentially reduce HIV risk in this population.","1573-3254:Agnew-Brune, Christine B:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3109-5458:Balaji, Alexandra B:Mustanski, Brian:Newcomb, Michael E:Prachand, Nik:Braunstein, Sarah L:Brady, Kathleen A:Hoots, Brooke E:Smith, Justin S:Paz-Bailey, Gabriela:Broz, Dita:NHBS-YMSM Study Group:Journal Article:United States:AIDS Behav. 2019 May 7. pii: 10.1007/s10461-019-02525-5. doi: 10.1007/s10461-019-02525-5.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065922","Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd., Mailstop E-46, Atlanta, GA, USA.

Aims: Our aim was to examine factors that predict increased dissemination of such messages. Method: We analyzed 10,998 positive messages authored on Twitter and studied factors associated with messages that are shared (re-tweeted) using logistic regression. Characteristics of the account, message, linguistic style, sentiment, and topic were examined. Results: Less than one third of positive messages (31.7%) were shared at least once. In adjusted models, accounts that posted a greater number of messages were less likely to have any single message shared. Messages about military-related topics were 60% more likely to be shared (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.6, 95% CI [1.1, 2.1]) as well as messages containing achievement-related keywords (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.3, 1.9]). Conversely, positive messages explicitly addressing eating/food, appearance, and sad affective states were less likely to be shared. Multiple other message characteristics influenced sharing. Limitations: Only messages on a single platform and over a focused period of time were analyzed. Conclusion: A knowledge of factors affecting dissemination of positive mental health messages may aid organizations and individuals seeking to promote such messages online.","2151-2396:Sumner, Steven A:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3805-7235:Bowen, Daniel A:Bartholow, Brad:Journal Article:Canada:Crisis. 2019 May 8:1-5. doi: 10.1027/0227-5910/a000598.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066310","1 Office of Strategy and Innovation, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA.:2 Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1027/0227-5910/a000598"

RESULTS: Of 248 Nipah virus cases identified, 82 were caused by person-to-person transmission, corresponding to a reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary cases per case patient) of 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.59). The predicted reproduction number increased with the case patient's age and was highest among patients 45 years of age or older who had difficulty breathing (1.1; 95% CI, 0.4 to 3.2). Case patients who did not have difficulty breathing infected 0.05 times as many contacts (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.3) as other case patients did. Serologic testing of 1863 asymptomatic contacts revealed no infections. Spouses of case patients were more often infected (8 of 56 [14%]) than other close family members (7 of 547 [1.3%]) or other contacts (18 of 1996 [0.9%]). The risk of infection increased with increased duration of exposure of the contacts (adjusted odds ratio for exposure of >48 hours vs. </=1 hour, 13; 95% CI, 2.6 to 62) and with exposure to body fluids (adjusted odds ratio, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 11). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age and respiratory symptoms were indicators of infectivity of Nipah virus. Interventions to control person-to-person transmission should aim to reduce exposure to body fluids.

METHODS: Socio-demographic and health characteristics extracted from electronic medical records were compared among pregnant women who enrolled in the study, refused to participate, or were never reached for study invitation. These characteristics plus additional self-reported information were compared between women who enrolled in two study tracks: a prospective cohort vs. women enrolled following an acute respiratory illness (ARI) medical encounter. The characteristics of women who participated in weekly ARI surveillance (cohort enrollees, year one) and a 6-month follow-up interview (all enrollees) were also examined. RESULTS: In year one, we reached 51% (6938/13,655) of the potential participants we tried to contact by telephone, and 20% (1374/6938) of the women we invited agreed to join the prospective cohort. Women with chronic medical conditions, pregnancy complications, and medical encounters for ARI (prior to pregnancy or during the study period) were more likely to be reached for recruitment and more likely to enroll in the cohort. Twenty percent of cohort enrollees never started weekly surveillance reports; among those who did, reports were completed for 55% of the surveillance weeks. Receipt of the influenza vaccine was higher among women who joined the cohort (76%) than those who refused (56%) or were never reached (54%). In contrast, vaccine uptake among medical enrollees in year one (54%; 53/98) and two (52%; 79/151) was similar to other pregnant women in those years. Study site, white race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, and not having a child aged < 13 years at home were most consistently associated with joining as a cohort or medical enrollee and completing study activities after joining. CONCLUSIONS: We observed systematic differences in socio-demographic and health characteristics across different levels of participant engagement and between cohort and medical enrollees. More methodological research and innovation in conducting prospective observational studies in this population are needed, especially when extended participant engagement and ongoing surveillance are required.","1471-2393:Thompson, Mark G:Li, De-Kun:Naleway, Allison L:Ferber, Jeannette R:Henninger, Michelle L:Shifflett, Pat:Sokolow, Leslie Z:Odouli, Roxana:Kauffman, Tia L:Fink, Rebecca V:Bulkley, Joanna:Cragan, Janet D:Bozeman, Sam:200-2010-F-33132/National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases:Journal Article:England:BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2019 May 8;19(1):161. doi: 10.1186/s12884-019-2280-0.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068160","Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA. isq8@cdc.gov.:Division of Research, Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, Oakland, CA, USA.:Department of Health Research and Policy, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA.:Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, OR, USA.:Abt Associates, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.:Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA.:Battelle Memorial Institute, Atlanta, GA, USA.:National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12884-019-2280-0"

METHODS: Using a nationwide survey, associations were analyzed between provider characteristics and perception of safety of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in breastfeeding women >/= 1 month postpartum without other venous thrombosis risk factors and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in breastfeeding women < 1 month postpartum and >/= 1 month postpartum. RESULTS: Approximately 68% of public-sector providers considered COCs safe for breastfeeding women >/= 1 month postpartum without other venous thrombosis risk factors, with lower odds among non-physicians versus physicians (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] range 0.34-0.51) and those with a focus on adolescent health/pediatrics versus reproductive health (aOR 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.99). Most public-sector providers considered DMPA safe for breastfeeding women during any time postpartum, with lower odds among non-physicians versus physicians (aOR range 0.20-0.54) and those with primary clinical focus other than reproductive health (aOR range 0.26-0.65). The majority of office-based physicians considered COCs safe for breastfeeding women >/= 1 month postpartum without other venous thrombosis risk factors, with lower odds among those who did not use, versus those who used, CDC's contraceptive guidance (aOR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.77). Most office-based physicians also considered DMPA safe for breastfeeding women during any time postpartum.

The impact of ACEs on patients with autoimmune disease is unknown. We compared the prevalence of ACEs in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients to population-based survey estimate and investigated relationships between ACEs and SLE outcomes. METHODS: Data derive from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study (CLUES), a sample of adult SLE patients. Participants completed a 10-item ACE questionnaire covering 3 domains (abuse, neglect, household challenges). We estimated ACEs prevalence in 269 CLUES participants compared to 2015 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) geographically matched respondents, standardized (age, sex, race/ethnicity) to CLUES participant characteristics. We examined associations for patient-reported and physician-assessed health status measures with overall ACE levels and domains using multivariable linear regression, controlling for socio-demographics, nephritis, and childhood onset SLE. RESULTS: Though specific domains varied, overall ACE levels were similar for CLUES and BRFSS respondents. Among SLE patients, 63.2% had >/=1 ACE and 19.3% had >/=4. ACEs were more prevalent in those who were older, women, Latino or African American, without college degrees, and with lupus nephritis. In adjusted models, higher ACE levels and ACE domains were associated with worse patient-reported SLE activity, depression, and health status, but were not significantly associated with physician-assessed SLE activity, damage, or severity. CONCLUSIONS: Given the association between ACE levels and important patient-reported outcomes in SLE, our study reinforces the need for prevention of ACEs in childhood and for clinical interventions to promote resilience among adults who have experienced ACEs.

Despite an increase in the 5-year survival rate from 50% in 1955 to approximately 90% in the 2000s, attributed largely to advances in management of SLE (2), premature mortality among SLE patients persists, often as a result of disease severity, infections, and cardiovascular disease.

Incident and prevalent SLE cases matched to the National Death Index through 2016 identified 97 and 401 deaths, respectively. Standardized mortality ratios adjusted for age group, sex, and race were two to three times higher among persons with SLE relative to expected deaths in the general population. Blacks had significantly higher cumulative mortality than did whites, and blacks with both incident and prevalent cases were significantly younger at death (mean age 51.8 and 52.3 years, respectively) than were whites (mean age 64.4 and 65.0 years, respectively). Whites had lower mortality after diagnosis than did blacks; among incident cases, mortality among whites did not occur until 5 years after SLE diagnosis, whereas blacks had significantly and persistently higher mortality from the time of diagnosis.

METHODS: Data from CDC's national Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS) for 2011-2015 were analyzed. Pregnancy-related mortality ratios (pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births; PRMRs) were calculated overall and by sociodemographic characteristics. The distribution of pregnancy-related deaths by timing relative to the end of pregnancy and leading causes of death were calculated. Detailed data on pregnancy-related deaths during 2013-2017 from 13 state maternal mortality review committees (MMRCs) were analyzed for preventability, factors that contributed to pregnancy-related deaths, and MMRC-identified prevention strategies to address contributing factors. RESULTS: For 2011-2015, the national PRMR was 17.2 per 100,000 live births. Non-Hispanic black (black) women and American Indian/Alaska Native women had the highest PRMRs (42.8 and 32.5, respectively), 3.3 and 2.5 times as high, respectively, as the PRMR for non-Hispanic white (white) women (13.0). Timing of death was known for 87.7% (2,990) of pregnancy-related deaths. Among these deaths, 31.3% occurred during pregnancy, 16.9% on the day of delivery, 18.6% 1-6 days postpartum, 21.4% 7-42 days postpartum, and 11.7% 43-365 days postpartum. Leading causes of death included cardiovascular conditions, infection, and hemorrhage, and varied by timing. Approximately sixty percent of pregnancy-related deaths from state MMRCs were determined to be preventable and did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity or timing of death. MMRC data indicated that multiple factors contributed to pregnancy-related deaths. Contributing factors and prevention strategies can be categorized at the community, health facility, patient, provider, and system levels and include improving access to, and coordination and delivery of, quality care. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-related deaths occurred during pregnancy, around the time of delivery, and up to 1 year postpartum; leading causes varied by timing of death. Approximately three in five pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.

By better understanding geologic variations of radon production in states, comprehensive cancer control efforts could be improved. The study purpose was to assess states with the greatest potential for elevated radon and the likelihood of radon-related actions in National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) awardee cancer plans. METHODS: Two state-level variables were derived to approximate potential for elevated radon using the Environmental Protection Agency county map and the 2015 U.S. Census. The association between radon potential and inclusion of radon activity within cancer plans was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of cancer plans recognized an association between radon and cancer risk, and included measurable radon activities. Most states with high radon potential included radon activity in cancer plans. Both measures of radon potential were significantly associated with NCCCP cancer plans including radon activity. CONCLUSIONS: Geospatial analyses help to prioritize radon-related lung cancer activities. In areas with high potential for radon exposure, increasing knowledge about potential for radon exposure may result in increased radon testing, mitigation, or other radon reducing strategies, and ultimately reduction of lung cancer deaths.","1573-7225:Gallaway, Michael Shayne:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7026-2300:Berens, Andrew S:Puckett, Mary C:Foster, Stephanie:Journal Article:Netherlands:Cancer Causes Control. 2019 May 9. pii: 10.1007/s10552-019-01162-6. doi: 10.1007/s10552-019-01162-6.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073874","Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F76, Atlanta, GA, 30341, USA. mgallaway@cdc.gov.:Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (GRASP), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F76, Atlanta, GA, 30341, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1007/s10552-019-01162-6"

We analyzed data from 2008, 2011, and 2014 of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system. African American men who have sex with men (MSM) were surveyed from 19 United States cities using venue-based sampling and tested for HIV infection. We used generalized estimating equations, using year of survey as an independent variable, adjusting for age, to determine differences for selected outcomes regarding healthcare and risk behaviors over time. Among the 1299 African American MSMW interviewed, significant increases were observed in the percent of men who had an HIV test in the previous 12 months (2008: 54%, 2011: 69%, and 2014: 68%, p-value < 0.001). Among HIV-positive men, the percentage of men who were aware of their infection at the time of the interview increased significantly over time (26, 35, and 48%, p-value = 0.002). Among those men, the percentage who reported currently being on antiretroviral therapy also increased significantly over time (46, 69, and 72%, p-value = 0.050). The percentage of men reporting high-risk sexual risk behaviors increased or remained stable. Our findings support the hypothesis that HIV testing and treatment has increased among African American MSM from 2008 to 2014.

METHODS: This study was based on the population-based Michigan Lupus Epidemiology & Surveillance (MILES) Cohort. Estimates of n-3 and n-6 intake were derived from Diet History Questionnaire II items (DHQ II; past year with portion size version). Patient-reported outcomes included self-reported lupus activity (Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire/SLAQ). Multivariable regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, and body mass index, was used to assess associations between absolute intake of n-3 and n-6, as well as the n-6:n-3 ratio, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: Among 456 SLE cases, 425 (93.2%) were female, 207 (45.4%) were black, and mean age was 52.9+/-12.3 years. Controlling for potential confounders, the average SLAQ score was significantly higher by 0.3 points [(95% CI 0.1, 0.6); p=0.013] with each unit increase of the n-6:n-3 ratio. Both lupus activity and PROMIS-Sleep Disturbance scores were lower with each 1g/1000 Kcal increase of n-3 fatty acids [SLAQ regression coefficient beta=-0.8 (95% CI -1.6, 0.0), p=0.055; PROMIS-Sleep beta=-1.1 (95% CI -2.0, -0.2), p=0.017]. Higher n-3 intakes were non-significantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms and comorbid fibromyalgia, and higher quality of life, whereas results for the n6:n3 ratio trended in the opposite direction. CONCLUSION: This population-based study suggests that higher dietary intake of n-3 fatty acids, and lower n-6:n-3 ratios, are favorably associated with patient-reported outcomes in SLE, particularly self-reported lupus activity and sleep quality.

Objective: To provide a status report on the reach and use of diabetes prevention services nationally. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationally representative, population-based cross-sectional analysis of 2016 and 2017 National Health Interview Survey data was conducted from August 3, 2017, through November 15, 2018. Nonpregnant, noninstitutionalized, civilian respondents 18 years or older at high risk for diabetes, defined as those with no self-reported diabetes diagnosis but with diagnosed prediabetes or an elevated American Diabetes Association (ADA) risk score (>5), were included in the analysis. Analyses were conducted for adults with (and in sensitivity analyses, for those without) elevated body mass index. Main Outcomes and Measures: Absolute numbers and proportions of adults at high risk with elevated body mass index receiving advice about diet, physical activity guidance, referral to weight loss programs, referral to diabetes prevention programs, or any of these, and those affirming engagement in each (or any) activity in the past year were estimated. To identify where gaps exist, a prevention continuum diagram plotted existing vs desired goal achievement. Variation in risk-reducing activities by age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, insurance status, history of gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or body mass index was also examined. Results: This analysis included 50912 respondents (representing 223.0 million adults nationally) 18 years or older (mean [SE] age, 46.1 [0.2] years; 48.1% [0.3%] male) with complete data and no self-reported diabetes diagnosis by their health care professional. Of the represented population, 36.0% (80.0 million) had either a physician diagnosis of prediabetes (17.9 million), an elevated ADA risk score (73.3 million), or both (11.3 million). Among those with diagnosed prediabetes, 73.5% (95% CI, 71.6%-75.3%) reported receiving advice and/or referrals for diabetes risk reduction from their health care professional, and, of those, 35.0% (95% CI, 30.5%-39.8%) to 75.8% (95% CI, 73.2%-78.3%) reported engaging in the respective activity or program in the past year. Half of adults with elevated ADA risk scores but no diagnosed prediabetes (50.6%; 95% CI, 49.5%-51.8%) reported receiving risk-reduction advice and/or referral, of whom 33.5% (95% CI, 30.1%-37.0%) to 75.2% (95% CI, 73.4%-76.9%) reported engaging in activities and/or programs. Participation in diabetes prevention programs was exceedingly low. Advice from a health care professional, age range from 45 to 64 years, higher educational attainment, health insurance status, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity were associated with higher engagement in risk-reducing activities and/or programs. Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults at high risk for diabetes, major gaps in receiving advice and/or referrals and engaging in diabetes risk-reduction activities and/or programs were noted. These results suggest that risk perception, health care professional referral and communication, and insurance coverage may be key levers to increase risk-reducing behaviors in US adults. These findings provide a benchmark from which to monitor future program availability and coverage, identification of prediabetes, and referral to and retention in programs.","2574-3805:Ali, Mohammed K:McKeever Bullard, Kai:Imperatore, Giuseppina:Benoit, Stephen R:Rolka, Deborah B:Albright, Ann L:Gregg, Edward W:Journal Article:United States:JAMA Netw Open. 2019 May 3;2(5):e193160. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.3160.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074808","Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.:Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.:Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.3160"

We aimed to compare the estimated impact of PCV on pneumococcal meningitis (PM) to impact of PCV on total invasive pneumococcal disease (tIPD) based on risk reduction after PCV introduction. METHODS: We conducted national, laboratory-based surveillance for tIPD during 2005-2016. We estimated and compared rates of PCV13 and non-PCV13 serotype disease among tIPD and PM in individuals aged <5years and >/=5years, and compared these rates between the 2005-2008 pre-PCV introduction period and two time points after PCV introduction, 2012 and 2016. RESULTS: We enrolled 45,853 tIPD cases; 17,251 (38%) were PM. By 2016, IPD caused by all serotypes decreased 55% (95%CI -57% to -53%) for tIPD, and 54% for PM (95%CI -58% to -51%), 0.7% difference between estimates (p=0.7). No significant differences were observed between PCV7-serotype disease reduction in tIPD and PM in both age groups or the additional 6 serotypes included in PCV13 in <5year olds in 2012 and 2016. In 2012 there was a significant difference between increases in non-PCV13 serotype disease in those >/=5years for tIPD and PM (32% greater increase in PM, p<0.001), but this difference was absent by 2016. There was a significant difference between the estimated decrease in additional PCV13 type disease in 2016 between tIPD and PM for those aged >/=5years (28% greater reduction in PM, p=0.008). CONCLUSION: PM showed similar reductions to tIPD seven years after PCV introduction in vaccine serotype disease in those <5years, and increases in non-vaccine serotype disease in all ages.","1873-2518:Kleynhans, Jackie:Cohen, Cheryl:McMorrow, Meredith:Tempia, Stefano:Crowther-Gibson, Penny:Quan, Vanessa:de Gouveia, Linda:von Gottberg, Anne:for GERMS-SA:Journal Article:Netherlands:Vaccine. 2019 May 7. pii: S0264-410X(19)30590-0. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.090.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076159","Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), Johannesburg, South Africa; South African Field Epidemiology Training Programme, NICD of the NHLS, Johannesburg, South Africa; School of Health Systems and Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.

Each patient was matched to two controls based on age, sex and body mass index. The mononuclear leucocyte mRNA expression of relevant genes and their products were determined. Serum folate, UMFA, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF) concentrations were significantly higher in HS-U compared with matched healthy controls (p<0.001, n=42). HS-NU had lower serum folate concentrations than matched healthy controls (p=0.044, n=12). HS-U and HS-NU presented similar hematological and biochemical markers profiles. No differences were found between HS-U and HS-NU for cytokine serum concentrations and mRNA expression genes. DHFR mRNA expression was higher in HS-U than in HS-NU. The use of high daily doses of FA for treatment of patients with HS may be excessive and is associated with elevated serum UMFA and elevated DHFR mRNA expression. It is not known whether long-term high-dose FA use by patients with HS might have adverse health effects.","1708-8267:Paniz, Clovis:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6676-2970:Lucena, Maylla Rodrigues:Bertinato, Juliano Felix:Lourenco, Felipe Rebello:Barros, Bruna Cipriano A:Gomes, Guilherme Wataru:Figueiredo, Maria Stella:Cancado, Rodolfo Delfini:Blaia-D Avila, Vera Lucia Nascimento:Pfeiffer, Christine M:Fazili, Zia:Green, Ralph:Carvalho, Valdemir Melechco:Guerra-Shinohara, Elvira Maria:Journal Article:England:J Investig Med. 2019 May 9. pii: jim-2019-001025. doi: 10.1136/jim-2019-001025.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076457","Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.:Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.:Farmacia, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.:Secao de Hematologia e Oncologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Santa Casa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.:Divisao de Hematologia, Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo, Sorocaba, Brazil.:CDC, National Center for Environment Health, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UC Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California, USA.:Grupo Fleury, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1136/jim-2019-001025"

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe vitamin D status in the US population in 2011-2014 and trends from 2003 to 2014. METHODS: We used serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D data from NHANES 2011-2014 (n = 16,180), and estimated the prevalence at risk of deficiency (<30 nmol/L) or prevalence at risk of inadequacy (30-49 nmol/L) by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, and dietary intake of vitamin D. We also present trends between 2003 and 2014. RESULTS: In 2011-2014, the percentage aged >/=1 y at risk of vitamin D deficiency or inadequacy was 5.0% (95% CI: 4.1%, 6.2%) and 18.3% (95% CI: 16.2%, 20.6%).

Persons with higher vitamin D dietary intake or who used supplements had lower prevalences of at risk of deficiency or inadequacy. From 2003 to 2014 there was no change in the risk of vitamin D deficiency; the risk of inadequacy declined from 21.0% (95% CI: 17.9%, 24.5%) to 17.7% (95% CI: 16.0%, 19.7%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of at risk of vitamin D deficiency in the United States remained stable from 2003 to 2014; at risk of inadequacy declined. Differences in vitamin D status by race and Hispanic origin warrant additional investigation.","1938-3207:Herrick, Kirsten A:Storandt, Renee J:Afful, Joseph:Pfeiffer, Christine M:Schleicher, Rosemary L:Gahche, Jaime J:Potischman, Nancy:Journal Article:United States:Am J Clin Nutr. 2019 May 10. pii: 5487983. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/nqz037.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076739","National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD.:Peraton Corporation, Herndon, VA.:National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/ajcn/nqz037"

Few studies have evaluated whether benzophenone-3 is associated with reproductive outcomes among women. We studied 304 women undergoing infertility treatment (2007-2017) in the prospective Environment and Reproductive Health cohort study and who underwent 449 treatment cycles (n=788 urines). Generalized linear mixed models were used with random intercepts to account for multiple cycles, and adjusting for confounders including physical activity. Analyses were also stratified by self-reported moderate/heavy outdoor work. The cycle-specific median (IQR) urinary benzophenone-3 concentration was 147 (58, 462) mcg/L, and 98% samples had detectable concentrations. Self-reported sunscreen use, physical activity, and time spent on moderate/heavy outdoor work were positively associated with urinary benzophenone-3. Adjusted probabilities of implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth were higher in increasing quartiles of benzophenone-3, but these associations were restricted to women who reported spending time outdoors performing moderate/heavy work. Specifically, among these women, those in the highest quartile of benzophenone-3 concentrations had 51% higher implantation (p,trend=0.02), 68% higher clinical pregnancy (p,trend=0.01) and 75% higher live birth (p,trend=0.02) adjusted probabilities than women in the lowest quartile. Benzophenone-3 was unrelated to these outcomes among women who did not report doing moderate/heavy work outdoors. These results confirm that sunscreen use is a source of benzophenone-3 exposure, and show positive associations between benzophenone-3 and pregnancy outcomes, especially among women who reported engaging in outdoor work. Since these associations may be subject to important residual confounding by lifestyle factors, further research is needed to confirm these novel results in other populations, and to investigate whether other factors may be affecting the relation of benzophenone-3 with fertility and other health outcomes.","1879-1026:Minguez-Alarcon, Lidia:Chiu, Yu-Han:Nassan, Feiby L:Williams, Paige L:Petrozza, John:Ford, Jennifer B:Calafat, Antonia M:Hauser, Russ:Chavarro, Jorge E:Earth Study Team:Journal Article:Netherlands:Sci Total Environ. 2019 May 2;678:390-398. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.452.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077917","Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

In an effort to build read-across capacity, raise awareness of the state of the science, and work towards a harmonization of read-across approaches across U.S. agencies, a new read-across workgroup was established under the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM).

In this article, we outline the charge and scope of the workgroup and summarize the current applications, tools used, and needs of the agencies represented on the workgroup for read-across. Of the agencies surveyed, the Environmental Protection Agency had the greatest experience in using read-across whereas other agencies indicated that they would benefit from gaining a perspective of the landscape of the tools and available guidance.

Previous studies have primarily focused on risk assessment, with few examining the health outcomes from an economic perspective. To inform environmental health policies, we estimated the economic costs of health outcomes associated with suboptimal temperature in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate attributable fractions/cases for mortality, emergency department visits, and emergency hospitalizations at various suboptimal temperature levels. The analyses were stratified by age group (i.e., youth (0-19 years), adult (20-64 years), and senior (65+ years)). We considered both direct medical costs and loss of productivity during economic cost assessment. Results show that youth have a large number of temperature-related emergency department visits, while seniors have large numbers of temperature-related mortality and emergency hospitalizations. Exposures to extremely low and high temperatures lead to $2.70 billion [95% empirical confidence interval (eCI): $1.91 billion, $3.48 billion] (costs are all based on 2016 USD value) economic costs annually. Moderately and extremely low and high temperature leads to $9.40 billion [eCI: $6.05 billion, $12.57 billion] economic costs. The majority of the economic costs are consistently attributed to cold (>75%), rather than heat exposures and to mortality (>95%), rather than morbidity. Our findings support prioritizing temperature-related health interventions designed to minimize the economic costs by targeting seniors and to reduce attributable cases by targeting youth.","1879-1026:Liu, Yang:Saha, Shubhayu:Hoppe, Brendalynn O:Convertino, Matteo:Journal Article:Netherlands:Sci Total Environ. 2019 Apr 29;678:702-711. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.398.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078861","Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota Twin-Cities, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414, USA.

Our objective was to determine the prevalence of and whether there was an association between psychological distress and disability among older persons affected by conflict in eastern Ukraine. Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomized cross-sectional household survey of persons aged >/=60 years in government and non-government controlled areas (GCA and NGCA) of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in January-March 2016. Psychological distress and dependency (degree of disability) were measured using the Kessler K6 Psychological Distress Scale and Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, respectively. Association between psychological distress and dependency was assessed using logistic regression adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results: Final sample included 758 and 418 persons in GCA and NGCA, respectively. Prevalence of serious psychological distress was 33.6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 28.0-39.7%) in GCA and 42.5% (95%CI, 36.1-49.2%) in NGCA. Overall, 32.2% (95%CI, 27.9-36.7%) of independent persons and 74.0% (95%CI, 65.2-81.2%) of moderately/severely dependent persons reported serious psychological distress (P < .0001). Being dependent, a woman, and having a chronic disease were all significantly associated with psychological distress in a logistic regression model. Conclusions: Prevalence of serious psychological distress was very high compared with rates reported from developed countries and was highly associated with disability.

METHODS: Data were analyzed from the National Inpatient Sample (2000-2015) and 31 publicly available State Inpatient Databases (2000-2015) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Delivery hospitalizations were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes for obstetric delivery. Depressive disorders were identified from ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes classified as depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (291.89, 292.84, 293.83, 296.2-296.26, 296.3-296.36, 300.4, and 311). Prevalence rates and average annual rate change were calculated nationally and across 28 states with at least 3 years of data and age, payer source, and race or ethnicity. RESULTS: The U.S. rate of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations increased from 4.1 diagnoses per 1,000 hospitalizations in 2000 to 28.7 in 2015. Rates significantly increased in 27 of the 28 states. Recent (2014-2015) rates were lowest in Hawaii and Nevada (less than 14/1,000) and highest in Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon, and Wisconsin (greater than 49/1,000). Rates in 2015 were highest among those aged 35 years or older, public insurance recipients, and non-Hispanic white women (greater than 31/1,000). The highest annual rate increases were in Vermont and Maine (3.8/1,000 or greater). Non-Hispanic white women, those 35 years of age or older, and public insurance recipients showed the highest annual rate increases during 2000-2015 (1.7/1,000 or greater). CONCLUSION: During 2000-2015, rates of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations increased nationally, in 27 states with available data, and across all sociodemographic categories.","1873-233x:Haight, Sarah C:Byatt, Nancy:Moore Simas, Tiffany A:Robbins, Cheryl L:Ko, Jean Y:Journal Article:United States:Obstet Gynecol. 2019 May 9. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000003291.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083140","Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; the University of Massachusetts Medical School, UMass Memorial Health Care, Worcester, Massachusetts; and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, Rockville, Maryland.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/aog.0000000000003291"

In these environments, secondhand exposures to high concentrations of e-cigarette emissions are prevalent. Some biomarkers for tobacco smoke exposure may be used to characterize secondhand e-cigarette exposures in such an environment. METHODS: Participants who did not use any tobacco product attended four separate e-cigarette events for approximately six hours. Urine and saliva samples were collected from participants prior to the event, immediately after the event, 4-h after the event, and the next morning (first void). Urine samples from 34 participants were analyzed for cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-N-acetylcysteine (3-HPMA), S-carboxyethyl-N-acetylcysteine (CEMA), select tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), and 8-isoprostane. Saliva samples were analyzed for cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine. RESULTS: Data from 28 of 34 participants were used in the data analysis. Creatinine-adjusted urinary cotinine concentrations increased up to 13-fold and peaked 4-h after completed exposure (range of adjusted geometric means [AGMs]=0.352-2.31mug/g creatinine). Salivary cotinine concentrations were also the highest 4-h after completed exposure (range of AGMs=0.0373-0.167ng/mL). Salivary cotinine and creatinine-corrected concentrations of urinary cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, CEMA, and 3-HPMA varied significantly across sampling times. Urinary and salivary cotinine, urinary trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, and urinary 3-HPMA concentrations also varied significantly across events. CONCLUSION: Secondhand e-cigarette exposures lasting six hours resulted in significant changes in exposure biomarker concentrations of both nicotine and acrolein but did not change exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Additional research is needed to understand the relationship between biomarker concentrations and environmental concentrations of toxicants in e-cigarette emissions.","1618-131x:Johnson, Jona M:Naeher, Luke P:Yu, Xiaozhong:Sosnoff, Connie:Wang, Lanqing:Rathbun, Stephen L:De Jesus, Victor R:Xia, Baoyun:Holder, Cory:Muilenburg, Jessica L:Wang, Jia-Sheng:Journal Article:Germany:Int J Hyg Environ Health. 2019 May 10. pii: S1438-4639(19)30149-X. doi: 10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.04.013.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085112","Environmental Health Science Department, College of Public Health, University of Georgia, 206 Environmental Health Science Building, Athens, GA, 30602, USA.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the uses and expenses of antihypertensive medications among hypertensive adults in the United States. METHODS: Using the 2014-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, adult men and nonpregnant women aged 18 or older who had a diagnosis code of hypertension and used any prescribed antihypertensive medication were included in the study (n=10,971). Adults with hypertension who were using a single antihypertensive medication were defined as single medication users, and those using two or more medications were defined as multiple medication users. Medications were classified into angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), thiazide-type diuretics (TDs), beta-blockers (BBs), and others. The average annual total antihypertensive medication expenses and the expenditures of each medication class were estimated by using generalized linear models with a log link and gamma distribution and were adjusted to 2015 US dollars. RESULTS: Among 10,971 hypertensive adults, 4759 (44.1%) were single medication users, and 6212 (55.9%) were multiple medication users. The average annual total cost for antihypertensive medications was $336 per person (95% confidence interval [CI]=$319-$353); $199 (95% CI=$177-$221) for single medication users and $436 (95% CI=$413-$459) for multiple medication users. The average annual costs for each medication class were estimated at $438 (95% CI=$384-$492) for ARBs and $49 for TDs (95% CI=$44-$55). CONCLUSIONS: Users of multiple medications incurred more than twice the expense than single medication users. When comparing classes of medications, the cost for ARBs was the highest, whereas the cost for TDs was the lowest. This information can be used in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of antihypertension therapies.","1934-8150:Park, Chanhyun:Wang, Guijing:Ng, Boon Peng:Fang, Jing:Durthaler, Jeffrey M:Ayala, Carma:Journal Article:United States:Res Social Adm Pharm. 2019 May 8. pii: S1551-7411(18)31011-8. doi: 10.1016/j.sapharm.2019.05.002.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085142","School of Pharmacy, Bouve College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.

To explore the evolutionary rate and constraints acting on this gene, k13 orthologs from species sharing a recent common ancestor with P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax were analyzed. These comparative studies were followed by genetic polymorphism analyses within P. falciparum using 982 complete Pfk13 sequences from public databases and new data obtained by next-generation sequencing from African and Haitian isolates. Although k13 orthologs evolve at heterogeneous rates, the gene was conserved across the genus with only synonymous substitutions at residues where mutations linked to the delayed parasite clearance phenotype have been reported. This suggests that those residues were under constraint from undergoing non-synonymous changes during the genus evolution. No fixed non-synonymous differences were found between Pfk13 and its orthologs in closely related species found in African Apes. This indicates that all non-synonymous substitutions currently found in Pfk13 are younger than the divergence between P. falciparum and its closely related species. At the population level, no mutations linked to delayed parasite clearance were found in our samples from Africa and Haiti. However, there is a high number of single Pfk13 mutations segregating in P. falciparum populations, and two predominant alleles are distributed worldwide. This pattern is discussed in terms of how changes in the efficacy of natural selection, affected by population expansion, may have allowed for the emergence of mutations tolerant to ACTs.","1098-6596:Pacheco, M Andreina:Kadakia, Esha R:Chaudhary, Zainab:Perkins, Douglas J:Kelley, Julia:Ravishankar, Shashidhar:Cranfield, Michael:Talundzic, Eldin:Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam:Escalante, Ananias A:Journal Article:United States:Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2019 May 13. pii: AAC.02550-18. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02550-18.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085516","Department of Biology/Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine (iGEM), Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.:Center for Global Health, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.:Atlanta Research and Education Foundation, VAMC, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Gorilla Doctors, Wildlife Health Department, University of California Davis, Davis, USA.:Malaria Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Department of Biology/Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine (iGEM), Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA Ananias.Escalante@temple.edu.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1128/aac.02550-18"

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this bacterial dissemination have yet to be elucidated. A study indicated that using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core as a ligand, S. typhimurium was able to bind human DC-SIGN (hCD209a), a HIV receptor that promotes viral dissemination by hijacking antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this study, we showed that S. typhimurium interacted with CD209s, leading to the invasion of APCs and potentially the dissemination to regional lymph nodes, spleen and liver in mice. Shielding of the exposed LPS core through the expression of O-antigen reduces dissemination and infection.

Changes in student knowledge scores from pre- to postcourse were explored using mixed-effects linear models. Teacher characteristics included professional development (PD) attendance, having a dedicated classroom, certification type, educational background, years' experience, and athletic coaching status. RESULTS: Teacher characteristics associated with greater student knowledge gains included: being certified to teach health versus not certified (p < .001), having a dedicated classroom versus no classroom (p = .017), and for middle school teachers, having attended >/=3 PD sessions versus </=2 (p = .023). Less knowledge gain was associated with teachers that coached versus noncoaches (p = .040) and having a health degree versus no health degree (p = .049).

In this study, we tested the role of an uncharacterized ER protein, PfGRP170, in regulating these key functions by generating conditional mutants. Our data show that PfGRP170 localizes to the ER and is essential for asexual growth, specifically required for proper development of schizonts. PfGRP170 is essential for surviving heat shock, suggesting a critical role in cellular stress response. The data demonstrate that PfGRP170 interacts with the Plasmodium orthologue of the ER chaperone, BiP.

One of the main sources of controversy is believed related to errors in estimating sodium intake with urine studies. The recommendations and positions in this manuscript were generated following a series of systematic reviews and analyses by experts in hypertension, nutrition, statistics, and dietary sodium. To assess the population's current 24-hour dietary sodium ingestion, single complete 24-hour urine samples, collected over a series of days from a representative population sample, were recommended. To accurately estimate usual dietary sodium at the individual level, at least 3 non-consecutive complete 24-hour urine collections obtained over a series of days that reflect the usual short-term variations in dietary pattern were recommended. Multiple 24-hour urine collections over several years were recommended to estimate an individual's usual long-term sodium intake. The role of single spot or short duration timed urine collections in assessing population average sodium intake requires more research. Single or multiple spot or short duration timed urine collections are not recommended for assessing an individual's sodium intake especially in relationship to health outcomes. The recommendations should be applied by scientific review committees, granting agencies, editors and journal reviewers, investigators, policymakers, and those developing and creating dietary sodium recommendations. Low-quality research on dietary sodium/salt should not be funded, conducted, or published.","1751-7176:Campbell, Norm R C:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1093-4742:He, Feng J:Tan, Monique:Cappuccio, Francesco P:Neal, Bruce:Woodward, Mark:Cogswell, Mary E:McLean, Rachael:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0005-328X:Arcand, Joanne:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1995-6905:MacGregor, Graham:Whelton, Paul:Jula, Antti:L'Abbe, Mary R:Cobb, Laura K:Lackland, Daniel T:P20GM109036/National Institute of General Medical Sciences:Journal Article:United States:J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2019 May 14. doi: 10.1111/jch.13551.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087778","Department of Medicine, Physiology and Pharmacology, Community Health Sciences, O'Brien Institute for Public Health and Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.:Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.:Division of Health Sciences, WHO Collaborating Centre for Nutrition, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.:The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.:The George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.:Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Chamblee, Georgia.:Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.:Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa Ontario, Canada.:Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana.:Department of Medicine, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana.:Department of Public Health Solutions, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Turku, Finland.:Department of Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.:Resolve to Save Lives, Vital Strategies, New York, NY.:Department of Neurology, Division of Translational Neuroscience and Population Studies, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1111/jch.13551"

Most respondents reported documenting vaccination coverage in electronic systems (85%) and sharing coverage reports with health departments (69%). A total of 41% of school nurses worked with external partners for vaccination efforts, the most common support received from partners being vaccine administration (38%) and providing materials/vaccines (21%). School nurses also reported that 95% of kindergartners were up to date for all vaccines.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Fertility treatment centers. PATIENTS: All live-born infants included in the National Vital Statistics System and resulting from ART cycles reported to the National ART Surveillance System during 2006-14. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Trends in the proportion of male infants in the general population and proportion of males from fresh ART cycles among all ART live-born infants and singletons after single ET. RESULT(S): There were 214,274 live-born infants resulting from fresh ART cycles; 53.5% (5,492/10,266) of infants resulting from PGD/PGS cycles were male, as compared with 50.6% (103,228/204,008) in the non-PGD/PGS group. Among non-PGD/PGS cycles, blastocyst transfer was positively associated with male infants (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.04). Intracytoplasmic sperm injection was negatively associated with male infants (aRR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93-0.95) and for singletons after single ET (aRR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.95), as was transfer of two embryos (aRR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99) or three or more embryos (aRR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99) among all live births from cycles without PGD/PGS use. CONCLUSION(S): The proportion of male live-born infants among ART population did not change during 2006-14, ranging from 50.5% to 51.2%. Factors such as blastocyst transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection use, embryo stage, and number of embryos transferred may be associated with infant sex; further investigation is needed to understand possible underlying causes.","1556-5653:Narvaez, Jennifer L:Chang, Jeani:Boulet, Sheree L:Davies, Michael J:Kissin, Dmitry M:Journal Article:United States:Fertil Steril. 2019 May 11. pii: S0015-0282(19)30317-6. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2019.03.034.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088685","Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Infants Hospital, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.:Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

To evaluate the effect of zoster vaccine live (ZVL) on progression of pain following HZ, we conducted a prospective cohort study of HZ cases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. METHODS: ZVL vaccinated and unvaccinated members aged >/=60years with laboratory-confirmed HZ from January 18, 2012 to February 26, 2015 were followed up within 5days of HZ diagnosis, and at 30, 60, and 90days after diagnosis. Pain was assessed with the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) on a 0-10 scale, using cut-points of >/=3, >/=5, and >/=7, with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) defined as pain >/=3 at 90days. Log binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with pain, comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated HZ patients. RESULTS: We interviewed 509 vaccinated and 509 unvaccinated HZ patients. ZVL was associated with significantly lower risks of HZ-related pain at all time-points. The risk of PHN in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively, was 9.2% and 15.4% (aRR=0.594, 95% CI: 0.413, 0.854); 2.0% and 4.8% of these patients reported pain >/=7 (aRR=0.332, 95% CI: 0.153, 0.721). Irrespective of vaccination, the risk of PHN was lower in adults aged <70years versus those >/=70years and was similar or lower in females versus males. CONCLUSION: We used laboratory confirmation of HZ cases and patient survey to show that aside from preventing HZ, ZVL reduced HZ-related pain and prevented PHN among vaccine recipients who experienced HZ. Observational studies will be needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness of the new recombinant zoster vaccine and its benefits in protecting patients against PHN.","1873-2518:Bruxvoort, Katia J:Liang, Anna S:Harpaz, Rafael:Qian, Lei:Sy, Lina S:LaRussa, Philip:Schmid, D Scott:Luo, Yi:Takhar, Harpreet:Tseng, Hung Fu:Journal Article:Netherlands:Vaccine. 2019 May 11. pii: S0264-410X(19)30615-2. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.095.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088744","Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA, United States.

This paper describes a robust, non-intrusive, straightforward approach to automatically extract spatial and temporal factors necessary for the RNLE using a single video camera in the sagittal plane. The participant's silhouette is segmented by motion information and the novel use of a ghosting effect provides accurate detection of lifting instances, and hand and feet location prediction. Laboratory tests using 6 participants each performing 36 lifts showed that a nominal 640 pixel x480 pixel 2D video, in comparison to 3D motion capture, provided RWL estimations within 0.2 kg (SD =1.0 kg). The linear regression between the video and 3D tracking RWL was R(2)=0.96 (slope =1.0, intercept =0.2 kg). Since low definition video was used in order to synchronize with motion capture, better performance is anticipated using high definition video. Practitioner Summary: An algorithm for automatically calculating the revised NIOSH lifting equation using a single video camera was evaluated in comparison to laboratory 3D motion capture. The results indicate that this method has suitable accuracy for practical use and may be particularly useful when multiple lifts are evaluated.","1366-5847:Wang, Xuan:Hu, Yu Hen:Lu, Ming-Lun:Radwin, Robert G:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7973-0641:Journal Article:England:Ergonomics. 2019 May 16:1-33. doi: 10.1080/00140139.2019.1618500.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092146","a Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , University of Wisconsin - Madison , Madison , Wisconsin , 53706 USA.:b National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Taft Laboratories , Cincinnati , Ohio 45226 , USA.:c Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering , University of Wisconsin - Madison , Madison , Wisconsin , 53706 USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1080/00140139.2019.1618500"

Diagnostic test results, including from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of upper respiratory tract specimens, have been used to estimate prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia. However limitations in test sensitivity and specificity and the specimen types available make establishing a definitive diagnosis challenging. Prevalence estimates for pneumococcal pneumonia could be biased in the absence of a true gold standard reference test for detecting Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: We conducted a case control study to identify etiologies of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from April 2014 through August 2015 in Thailand. We estimated the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia among adults hospitalized for CAP using Bayesian latent class models (BLCMs) incorporating results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing of upper respiratory tract specimens and a urine antigen test (UAT) from cases and controls. We compared the prevalence estimate to conventional analyses using only UAT as a reference test. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia was 8% (95% CI: 5-11%) by conventional analyses. By BLCM, we estimated the prevalence to be 10% (95% CrI: 7-16%) using binary qPCR and UAT results, and 11% (95% CrI: 7-17%) using binary UAT results and qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values. CONCLUSIONS: BLCM suggests a > 25% higher prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia than estimated by a conventional approach assuming UAT as a gold standard reference test. Higher quantities of pneumococcal DNA in the upper respiratory tract were associated with pneumococcal pneumonia in adults but the addition of a second specific pneumococcal test was required to accurately estimate disease status and prevalence. By incorporating the inherent uncertainty of diagnostic tests, BLCM can obtain more reliable estimates of disease status and improve understanding of underlying etiology.","1471-2334:Lu, Ying:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7420-0206:Joseph, Lawrence:Belisle, Patrick:Sawatwong, Pongpun:Jatapai, Anchalee:Whistler, Toni:Thamthitiwat, Somsak:Paveenkittiporn, Wantana:Khemla, Supphacoke:Van Beneden, Chris A:Baggett, Henry C:Gregory, Christopher J:Journal Article:England:BMC Infect Dis. 2019 May 15;19(1):423. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4067-3.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092207","Division of Global Health Protection, Thailand Ministry of Public Health-US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration, Nonthaburi, Thailand. ryluzhang@yahoo.com.:Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.:Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal,Montreal, Montreal, Canada.:Division of Global Health Protection, Thailand Ministry of Public Health-US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration, Nonthaburi, Thailand.:Office of Public Health, Regional Development Mission for Asia, US Agency for International Development, Bangkok, Thailand.:Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, National Institute of Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.:Nakhon Phanom Provincial Hospital, Ministry of Public Health, Nakhon Phanom, Thailand.:Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Division of Global Health Protection, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Present affiliation: Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12879-019-4067-3"

Methods: The study examines age-standardized mortality rates and 10-year trends due to death from cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes in two territories of the United States of America (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and in 20 other English- or Dutch-speaking Caribbean countries or territories, for the most recent, available 10 years of data ranging from 1999 to 2014. For the analysis, the SEER*Stat and Joinpoint software packages were used. Results: These four NCDs accounted for 39% to 67% of all deaths in these 22 countries and territories, and more than half of the deaths in 17 of them. Heart disease accounted for higher percentages of deaths in most of the Caribbean countries and territories (13%-25%), followed by cancer (8%-25%), diabetes (4%-21%), and cerebrovascular disease (1%-13%). Age-standardized mortality rates due to cancer and heart disease were higher for males than for females, but there were no significant mortality trends in the region for any of the NCDs.

Pneumococcal genomic surveys elucidate PCV effects on population structure but are rarely conducted in low-income settings despite the high disease burden. METHODS: We undertook whole genome sequencing of 660 pneumococcal isolates collected through surveys from healthy carriers two years from PCV14 introduction and one-year post-rollout in northern Malawi. We investigated changes in population structure, within-lineage serotype dynamics, serotype diversity, and frequency of antibiotic resistance (ABR) and accessory genes. RESULTS: In the under-fives, frequency and diversity of vaccine serotypes (VT) decreased significantly post-PCV but no significant changes occurred in over-fives. Clearance of VT serotypes was consistent across different genetic backgrounds (lineages). There was an increase of non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) namely 7C, 15B/C, 23A in under-fives but 28F increased in both age groups. While carriage rates have been recently shown to remain stable post-PCV due replacement serotypes, there was no change in diversity of NVTs. Additionally, frequency of intermediate-penicillin-resistant lineages decreased post-PCV. While frequency of ABR genes remained stable, other accessory genes especially those associated with MGEs and bacteriocins showed changes in frequency post-PCV. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate evidence of significant population restructuring post-PCV driven by decreasing frequency of vaccine serotypes and increasing frequency of few NVTs mainly in under-fives. Continued surveillance with WGS remains crucial to fully understand dynamics of the residual VTs and replacement NVT serotypes post-PCV.","1537-6591:Chaguza, Chrispin:Heinsbroek, Ellen:Gladstone, Rebecca A:Tafatatha, Terence:Alaerts, Maaike:Peno, Chikondi:Cornick, Jennifer E:Musicha, Patrick:Bar-Zeev, Naor:Kamng'ona, Arox:Kadioglu, Aras:McGee, Lesley:Hanage, William P:Breiman, Robert F:Heyderman, Robert S:French, Neil:Everett, Dean B:Bentley, Stephen D:Journal Article:United States:Clin Infect Dis. 2019 May 16. pii: 5490137. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz404.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094423","Parasites and Microbes Programme, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK.:Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.:Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, Blantyre, Malawi.:HIV & STI Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, London, UK.:Malawi Epidemiology Intervention Research Unit (formerly KPS), Chilumba, Malawi.:Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.:MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.:Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.:Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.:Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA.:Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Malawi, College of Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi.:Respiratory Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA.:Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Five vat polymerization printers (three stereolithography (SLA) and two digital light processing (DLP) were evaluated individually in a 12.85 m(3) chamber. Aerosols (number, size) and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) were measured using real-time monitors. Carbonyl vapors and particulate matter were collected for offline analysis using impingers and filters, respectively. During printing, particle emission yields (#/g printed) ranged from 1.3 +/- 0.3 to 2.8 +/- 2.6 x 10(8) (SLA printers) and from 3.3 +/- 1.5 to 9.2 +/- 3.0 x 10(8) (DLP printers). Yields for number of particles with sizes 5.6 to 560 nm (#/g printed) were 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(10) and from 1.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.0 +/- 1.2 x 10(10) for SLA and DLP printers, respectively.

Geometric mean mobility particle sizes were 41.1-45.1 nm for SLA printers and 15.3-28.8 nm for DLP printers. Mean particle and TVOC yields were statistically significantly higher and mean particle sizes were significantly smaller for DLP printers compared with SLA printers (p < 0.05). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of individual particles qualitatively identified potential occupational carcinogens (chromium, nickel) as well as reactive metals implicated in generation of reactive oxygen species (iron, zinc). Lung deposition modeling indicates that about 15-37% of emitted particles would deposit in the pulmonary region (alveoli). Benzaldehyde (1.0-2.3 ppb) and acetone (0.7-18.0 ppb) were quantified in emissions from four of the printers and 4-oxopentanal (0.07 ppb) was detectable in the emissions from one printer. Vat polymerization printers emitted nanoscale particles that contained potential carcinogens, sensitizers, and reactive metals as well as carbonyl compound vapors. Differences in emissions between SLA and DLP printers indicate that the underlying technology is an important factor when considering exposure reduction strategies such as engineering controls.","1545-9632:Stefaniak, A B:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3914-1460:Bowers, L N:Knepp, A K:Luxton, T P:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1774-5407:Peloquin, D M:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4489-3475:Baumann, E J:Ham, J E:Wells, J R:Johnson, A R:LeBouf, R F:Su, F-C:Martin, S B:Virji, M A:Journal Article:England:J Occup Environ Hyg. 2019 May 16:1-13. doi: 10.1080/15459624.2019.1612068.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094667","a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , Morgantown , West Virginia.:b U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory , Cincinnati , Ohio.:c Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education , Oak Ridge , Tennessee.:d Pegasus Technical Services , Cincinnati , Ohio.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1080/15459624.2019.1612068"

SETTING: A clinical trial among HIV-infected women in Lilongwe, Malawi, randomized to initiation of depomedroxyprogesterone acetate injectable or levonorgestrel implant, and followed for up to 33 months, with the outcome of HIV shedding in the genital tract. METHODS: We compared the frequency and magnitude of HIV genital shedding before and after initiation of contraception and between study arms among women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Genital HIV RNA was measured in TearFlo Strips using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay. RESULTS: Among 68 HIV-infected Malawian women on ART, randomization to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate compared with the levonorgestrel implant was not associated with genital shedding and neither progestin contraceptive was associated with increased HIV genital shedding, for up to 33 months after contraceptive initiation. Having detectable plasma HIV [adjusted risk ratio (RR) 10.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.18 to 34.7] and detectable genital shedding before contraceptive initiation (adjusted RR 3.53; 95% CI: 1.31 to 9.47) were associated with a higher risk of detectable genital shedding after contraceptive initiation. Higher plasma efavirenz concentrations were associated with a lower risk of detectable genital shedding (adjusted RR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.99, per increase of 1000 ng/mL). CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected women receiving ART, our results provide evidence that progestin contraception does not impact women's risk of transmission of HIV to partners. Our finding that detectable genital shedding before contraceptive initiation independently predicts shedding suggests that there may be other individual-level biological or behavioral factors that increase the risk for shedding.","1944-7884:Kourtis, Athena P:Wiener, Jeffrey:Hurst, Stacey:Nelson, Julie A E:Cottrell, Mackenzie L:Corbett, Amanda:Chinula, Lameck:Msika, Albans:Haddad, Lisa B:Tang, Jennifer H:Journal Article:United States:J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2019 Jun 1;81(2):163-165. doi: 10.1097/QAI.0000000000002011.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095006","U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.:UNC Project-Malawi, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Emory University, Atlanta, GA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/qai.0000000000002011"

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted of eligible systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and relevant governmental reports published between 2011 and 2016. For the physical activity promotion question, articles were first sorted by four social ecological levels of impact (i.e., individual, community, communication environment, and physical environment and policy levels) and then further sorted into more specific categories that emerged during the review process. For the sedentary behavior reduction question, the literature was sorted directly into emergent categories (i.e., youth, adult, and worksite interventions). RESULTS: Effective physical activity promotion strategies were identified at each level of impact, including those based on behavior change theories and those occurring at different settings throughout the community. Effective interventions also included those delivered in person by trained staff or peer volunteers and through different information and communication technologies, such as by phone, Web or Internet, and computer-tailored print. A range of built environment features were associated with more transit-based and recreational physical activity in children and adults. Effective sedentary reduction interventions were found for youth and in the workplace. CONCLUSIONS: A promising number of interventions with demonstrated effectiveness were identified. Future recommendations for research include investigating the most useful methods for disseminating them to real-world settings; incorporating more diverse population subgroups, including vulnerable and underrepresented subgroups; collecting cost data to inform cost-effectiveness comparisons; and testing strategies across different levels of impact to determine which combinations achieve the greatest effects on different modes of physical activity across the week.","1530-0315:King, Abby C:Whitt-Glover, Melicia C:Marquez, David X:Buman, Matthew P:Napolitano, Melissa A:Jakicic, John:Fulton, Janet E:Tennant, Bethany L:2018 physical activity guidelines advisory committee*:Journal Article:United States:Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2019 Jun;51(6):1340-1353. doi: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001945.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095090","Department of Health Research & Policy and the Stanford Prevention Research Center, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.:Gramercy Research Group, Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, NC.:Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.:College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ.:Preventive and Community Health and Exercise and Nutrition Science, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, DC.:Department of Health and Physical Activity, Physical Activity and Weight Management Research Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.:Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:ICF, Fairfax, VA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1249/mss.0000000000001945"

We estimated the proportion of HIV incidence among men who have sex with men attributable to infection with the 2 most common bacterial STIs, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). METHODS: We used a stochastic, agent-based model of a sexual network of MSM with cocirculating HIV, NG, and CT infections. Relative risk (RR) multipliers, specific to anatomic site of infection, modified the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition based on STI status. We estimated the effect of NG and CT on HIV incidence overall and on HIV acquisition and HIV transmission separately. Each scenario was simulated for 10 years. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was determined for each combination of RRs by comparing the incidence in the final year of a scenario to a scenario in which the RRs associated with NG and CT were set to 1.0. RESULTS: Overall, 10.2% (interquartile range [IQR], 7.9-12.4) of HIV infections were attributable to NG/CT infection. Then in sensitivity analyses, the PAF for HIV transmission ranged from 3.1% (IQR, 0.5-5.2) to 20.4% (IQR, 17.8-22.5) and the PAF for HIV acquisition ranged from 2.0% (IQR, -0.7 to 4.3) to 13.8% (IQR, 11.7-16.0). CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges in estimating the causal impact of NG/CT on HIV risk, modeling is an alternative approach to quantifying plausible ranges of effects given uncertainty in the biological cofactors. Our estimates represent idealized public health interventions in which STI could be maximally prevented, setting targets for real-world STI interventions that seek to reduce HIV incidence.","1537-4521:Jones, Jeb:Weiss, Kevin:Mermin, Jonathan:Dietz, Patricia:Rosenberg, Eli S:Gift, Thomas L:Chesson, Harrell:Sullivan, Patrick S:Lyles, Cynthia:Bernstein, Kyle T:Jenness, Samuel M:Journal Article:United States:Sex Transm Dis. 2019 Jun;46(6):357-363. doi: 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000980.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095100","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University at Albany, Albany, NY.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/olq.0000000000000980"

METHODS: Clinic record data and student retrospective self-report surveys (n = 193) tested for differences between the GYT intervention school and a comparison school on a number of outcomes, including human immunodeficiency virus and STD testing. RESULTS: Clinic record data showed that testing increased significantly more for the intervention than the comparison school during the GYT implementation period (B, 2.9; SE, 1.1, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the odds of being tested at the referral clinic were more than 4 times (odds ratio, 4.4) as high for students in the campaign school than for those in the comparison school (95% confidence interval, 2.3-8.2). Survey data did not show increased self-reported testing but, more students in the GYT school (92.7%) were aware of where to receive free, low-cost, or affordable human immunodeficiency virus and STD testing than students in the comparison school (76.0%; P < 0.01). Among sexually experienced students (n = 142), significantly more from the campaign school reported that they intended to test for STDs in the next 3 months (48.4% strongly agree and 33.2% agree) compared with those at the comparison school (27.4% strongly agree and 32.9% agree; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot suggests that a student-led GYT campaign in high schools may successfully increase STD testing of students. Although some of the findings from this pilot evaluation are promising, they are limited, and broader implementation and evaluation is needed. Future evaluation efforts can include more rigorous study designs, multiple schools or districts, longer campaign and evaluation across an entire school or calendar year, or in combination with other school-based testing strategies like a mass school-based screening event.","1537-4521:Liddon, Nicole:Carver, Lisa H:Robin, Leah:Harper, Chris R:Murray, Colleen C:Habel, Melissa A:Lesesne, Catherine A:Journal Article:United States:Sex Transm Dis. 2019 Jun;46(6):383-388. doi: 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000983.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095101","Division of Health, Research, Informatics, and Technology, ICF, Atlanta GA.:Division of STD Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/olq.0000000000000983"

Methods. We analyzed quarterly and yearly changes in heroin overdoses during 2017-2018 by using data from 23 states and jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance program. The analyses included the Pearson chi(2) test to detect significant changes. Results. Both sexes, all age groups, and some states exhibited increases from quarter 1 (Q1) 2017 to Q2 2017 and significant decreases in both quarters from Q3 2017 to Q1 2018 in heroin overdose ED visits. Overall, there was a significant yearly decline of 21.5% in heroin overdose ED visits. Three states had significant yearly increases (Illinois, Indiana, and Utah), and 9 states (Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia had significant decreases. Conclusions. We identified decreases in heroin overdose ED visits from 2017 through 2018, but these declines were not consistent among states. Even with the possibility of a stabilization or slowing of this epidemic, it is important that the field of public health and its partners implement strategies to prevent overdoses and target emerging hot spots.

The purpose of this study was to explore whether patient smoking status and smoking-cessation modalities data in the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) could be augmented by linkage with health claims data. METHODS: The KCR conducted a data linkage with health claims data from Medicare, Medicaid, state employee insurance, Humana, and Anthem. Smoking status was defined as documentation of personal history of tobacco use (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] code V15.82) or tobacco use disorder (ICD-9 305.1) before and after a cancer diagnosis. Use of smoking-cessation treatments before and after the cancer diagnosis was defined as documentation of smoking-cessation counseling (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes 99406, 99407, G0375, and G0376) or pharmacotherapy (eg, nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline). RESULTS: From 2007 to 2011, among 23,703 patients in the KCR, we discerned a valid prediagnosis smoking status for 78%. KCR data only (72%), claims data only (6%), and a combination of both data sources (22%) were used to determine valid smoking status. Approximately 4% of patients with cancer identified as smokers (n = 11,968) and were provided smoking-cessation counseling, and 3% were prescribed pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. CONCLUSION: Augmenting KCR data with medical claims data increased capture of smoking status and use of smoking-cessation modalities. Cancer registries interested in exploring smoking status to influence treatment and research activities could consider a similar approach, particularly if their registry does not capture smoking status for a majority of patients.","2473-4276:Gallaway, Michael Shayne:Huang, Bin:Chen, Quan:Tucker, Tom:McDowell, Jaclyn:Durbin, Eric:Siegel, David:Tai, Eric:Journal Article:United States:JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2019 May;(3):1-8. doi: 10.1200/CCI.19.00011.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095418","1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:2 University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1200/cci.19.00011"

METHODS: In February 2017, we conducted and evaluated a VTTX facilitated via videoconferencing among 26 pediatricians and public health practitioners from 4 states. Using a mixed-methods design, we assessed participants' knowledge and confidence to fulfill targeted federal preparedness capabilities immediately before and after the exercise. We also evaluated the degree to which participants made progress on actions through surveys 1 month (n = 14) and 6 months (n = 14) after the exercise. RESULTS: Participants reported a greater ability to identify their state's pediatric emergency preparedness strengths and weaknesses after the exercise (16 of 18) compared with before the exercise (10 of 18). We also observed increases in (1) knowledge of and confidence in performing most pediatric emergency preparedness capabilities and (2) most dimensions of interprofessional collaboration. From 1 month to 6 months after the exercise, participants (n = 14) self-reported making progress in increasing awareness for potential preparedness partners and in conducting similar pediatric exercises (from 4-7 for both).

This report also describes a toxic chlorine gas incident that occurred at a public pool in New York in 2018. Pool chemical injuries are preventable. CDC's Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is an important resource that operators of public treated recreational water venues (e.g., at hotels, apartment complexes, and waterparks) can use to prevent pool chemical injuries.","1545-861x:Vanden Esschert, Kayla L:Haileyesus, Tadesse:Tarrier, Amanda L:Donovan, Michelle A:Garofalo, Gary T:Laco, Joseph P:Hill, Vincent R:Hlavsa, Michele C:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 May 17;68(19):433-438. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6819a2.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095536",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6819a2"

We aimed to estimate clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness (CE), and budgetary impact (BI) of HCV testing and treatment in United States (U.S.) prisons or linkage to care at release. METHODS: We used individual-based simulation modeling with healthcare and Department of Corrections (DOC) perspectives for CE and BI analyses, respectively. We simulated a U.S. prison cohort at entry using published data and Washington State DOC individual-level data. We considered permutations of testing (risk factor-based, routine at entry or at release, no testing), treatment (if liver fibrosis >/=F3, for all HCV-infected or no treatment) and linkage to care (at release or no linkage). Outcomes included quality adjusted life years (QALY); cases identified, treated and cured; cirrhosis cases avoided; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER); DOC costs (2016 US $); and BI (healthcare cost/prison entrant) to generalize to other states. RESULTS: Compared to ""no testing, no treatment and no linkage to care"", ""test all, treat all, and linkage to care at release"" increased the lifetime sustained virologic response by 23%, reduced cirrhosis cases by 54% at a DOC annual additional cost of $1,440/ prison entrant, and would be cost-effective. At current drug prices, targeted testing and liver fibrosis-based treatment provided worse outcomes at higher cost or worse outcomes at higher cost/QALY gained. In sensitivity analysis, fibrosis-based treatment restrictions were cost-effective at previous higher drug costs. CONCLUSIONS: Although costly, widespread testing and treatment in prisons are considered of good value at current drug prices.","1537-6591:Assoumou, Sabrina A:Tasillo, Abriana:Vellozzi, Claudia:Yazdi, Golnaz Eftekhari:Wang, Jianing:Nolen, Shayla:Hagan, Liesl:Thompson, William:Randall, Liisa M:Strick, Lara:Salomon, Joshua A:Linas, Benjamin P:Journal Article:United States:Clin Infect Dis. 2019 May 16. pii: 5490662. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz383.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095676","Section of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.:Section of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.:Grady Health System, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Prevention Branch, Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GA, USA.:Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.:Division of Allergy & Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.:Washington State Department of Corrections, Tumwater, WA, USA.:Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.:Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/cid/ciz383"

Resulting from Nigeria's decade long conflict with Boko Haram, health officials had been unable to access as much as 60% of the settlements in Borno, hindering vaccination and surveillance efforts. This lack of accessibility made it difficult for the government to assess the current population distribution within Borno. This study aimed to use high resolution, visible band satellite imagery to assess the habitation of inaccessible villages in Borno State. METHODS: Using high resolution (31-50 cm) imagery from DigitalGlobe, analysts evaluated the habitation status of settlements in Borno State identified by Nigeria's Vaccination Tracking System. The analysts looked at imagery of each settlement and, using vegetation (overgrowth vs. cleared) as a proxy for human habitation, classified settlements into three categories: inhabited, partially abandoned, and abandoned. Analysts also classified the intact percentage of each settlement starting at 0% (totally destroyed since last assessment) and increasing in 25% intervals through 100% (completely intact but not expanded) up to 200+% (more than doubled in size) by looking for destroyed buildings. These assessments were then used to adjust previously established population estimates for each settlement. These new population distributions were compared to vaccination efforts to determine the number of children under 5 unreached by vaccination teams. RESULTS: Of the 11,927 settlements assessed 3203 were assessed as abandoned (1892 of those completely destroyed), 662 as partially abandoned, and 8062 as fully inhabited as of December of 2017. Comparing the derived population estimates from the new assessments to previous assessment and the activities of vaccination teams shows that an estimated 180,155 of the 337,411 under five children who were unreached in 2016 were reached in 2017 (70.5% through vaccination efforts in previously inaccessible areas, 29.5% through displacement to accessible areas). CONCLUSIONS: This study's methodology provides important planning and situation awareness information to health workers in Borno, Nigeria, and may serve as a model for future data gathering efforts in inaccessible regions.","1476-072x:Higgins, Jeff:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5837-9066:Adamu, Usman:Adewara, Kehinde:Aladeshawe, Adeshina:Aregay, Aron:Barau, Inuwa:Berens, Andrew:Bolu, Omotayo:Dutton, Nina:Iduma, Nnaemeka:Jones, Bryant:Kaplan, Brian:Meleh, Sule:Musa, Melton:Wa Nganda, Gatei:Seaman, Vincent:Sud, Anupma:Vouillamoz, Stephane:Wiesen, Eric:Journal Article:England:Int J Health Geogr. 2019 May 16;18(1):11. doi: 10.1186/s12942-019-0175-y.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096971","Geospatial Research, Analysis and Services Program (GRASP), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy NE, Atlanta, GA, 30341, USA. mpn7@cdc.gov.:National Polio Emergency Operations Center, Abuja, Nigeria.:eHealth Africa, Maiduguri, Nigeria.:Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA.:World Health Organization, Abuja, Nigeria.:National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Abuja, Nigeria.:Geospatial Research, Analysis and Services Program (GRASP), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy NE, Atlanta, GA, 30341, USA.:Global Immunization Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA.:Solina Health, Maiduguri, Nigeria.:Borno State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Maiduguri, Nigeria.:African Field Epidemiology Network, Maiduguri, Nigeria.:Novel-T Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12942-019-0175-y"

The disease is a recognized problem in canine breeding populations, and the risk to individuals assisting with birthing is well described. Prior to 2015, all cases of canine brucellosis reported to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health were in dogs used for breeding. In 2015, canine brucellosis was identified in eight Minnesota rescue dogs, all originating from specific geographic areas in South Dakota. Our objective was to measure the seroprevalence of B. canis in stray and previously owned dogs entering a large Minnesota animal rescue organization to determine if our observations represented a localized or generalized disease issue among rescue dogs. METHODS: A stratified random sample of stray and previously owned dogs entering the largest Minnesota animal rescue organization between November 1, 2016 and November 7, 2017, was tested for B. canis antibodies by the 2-Mercaptoethanol Rapid Slide Agglutination Test (2ME-RSAT) (Zoetis d-TEC((R)) CB kit). Sample sizes for each strata were calculated using previously published seroprevalence estimates. Blood from selected dogs was collected, serum harvested, and transported to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for testing. Positive samples in the 2ME-RSAT were shipped to Cornell University for confirmation by Agarose Gel Immunodiffusion (AGID) testing. Demographics, state and setting of origin, and health status were collected on study-dogs. RESULTS: Of the 10,654 dogs accepted by AHS during the study period, 943 (8.9%) were selected for testing. Most study dogs arrived from Oklahoma (28%), Alabama (18%), and Minnesota (12%). The median age of study dogs was 1.5 years; 303 (32%) were intact males and 294 (31%) were intact females. Most study dogs were strays (n = 716, 76%). Of the total, 22 (3.1%) stray and eight (3.5%) owner-surrendered dogs were presumptively positive by RSAT; one (0.11%) of the stray dogs was positive by 2ME-RSAT and confirmed by AGID. The positive dog was a healthy-appearing 1 year-old neutered male beagle from Texas. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of canine brucellosis in dogs entering Minnesota for adoption from multiple states was low. Never-the-less, care must to be taken to consider all potential risks and outcomes of interstate and international dog trade, including the spread of infectious diseases such as canine brucellosis.","1873-1716:Whitten, Tory V:Brayshaw, Graham:Patnayak, Devi:Alvarez, Julio:Larson, Christina M:Root Kustritz, Margaret:Holzbauer, Stacy M:Torrison, Jerry:Scheftel, Joni M:Journal Article:Netherlands:Prev Vet Med. 2019 Jul 1;168:90-94. doi: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.04.015.

We report screening outcomes, cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and sensitivity analyses results. RESULTS: Compared with no program and no screening, the NBCCEDP lowers breast cancer mortality and improves QALYs, but raises health care costs.

These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles species mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is occasionally acquired by persons who have not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, laboratory exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to provide information on its occurrence (e.g., temporal, geographic, and demographic), guide prevention and treatment recommendations for travelers and patients, and facilitate transmission control measures if locally acquired cases are identified. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes confirmed malaria cases in persons with onset of illness in 2016 and summarizes trends in previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are reported to local and state health departments by health care providers or laboratory staff members. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), or direct CDC consultations. CDC reference laboratories provide diagnostic assistance and conduct antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on blood samples submitted by health care providers or local or state health departments. This report summarizes data from the integration of all NMSS and NNDSS cases, CDC reference laboratory reports, and CDC clinical consultations. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 2,078 confirmed malaria cases with onset of symptoms in 2016, including two congenital cases, three cryptic cases, and one case acquired through blood transfusion. The number of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States has been increasing since the mid-1970s. However, in 2015 a decrease occurred in the number of cases, specifically from the region of West Africa, likely due to altered travel related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak. The number of confirmed malaria cases in 2016 represents a 36% increase compared with 2015, and the 2016 total is 153 more cases than in 2011, which previously had the highest number of cases (1,925 cases). In 2016, a total of 1,729 cases originated from Africa, and 1,061 (61.4%) of these came from West Africa. P. falciparum accounted for the majority of the infections (1,419 [68.2%]), followed by P. vivax (251 [12.1%]). Fewer than 2% of patients were infected by two species (23 [1.1%]). The infecting species was not reported or was undetermined in 10.8% of cases. CDC provided diagnostic assistance for 12.1% of confirmed cases and tested 10.8% of specimens with P. falciparum infections for antimalarial resistance markers. Of the U.S. resident patients who reported reason for travel, 69.4% were travelers who were visiting friends and relatives. The proportion of U.S. residents with malaria who reported taking any chemoprophylaxis in 2016 (26.3%) was similar to that in 2015 (26.6%), and adherence was poor among those who took chemoprophylaxis. Among the 964 U.S. residents with malaria for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region were known, 94.0% of patients with malaria did not adhere to or did not take a CDC-recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen. Among 795 women with malaria, 50 were pregnant, and one had adhered to mefloquine chemoprophylaxis. Forty-one (2.0%) malaria cases occurred among U.S. military personnel in 2016, a comparable proportion to that in 2015 (23 cases [1.5%]). Among all reported cases in 2016, a total of 306 (14.7%) were classified as severe illnesses, and seven persons died. In 2016, CDC analyzed 144 P. falciparum-positive and nine P. falciparum mixed species samples for surveillance of antimalarial resistance markers (although certain loci were untestable in some samples); genetic polymorphisms associated with resistance to pyrimethamine were identified in 142 (97.9%), to sulfadoxine in 98 (70.5%), to chloroquine in 67 (44.7%), to mefloquine in six (4.3%), and to atovaquone in one (<1.0%). The completeness of key variables (e.g., species, country of acquisition, and resident status) was 79.4% in 2016 and 75.7% in 2015. INTERPRETATION: The number of reported malaria cases in 2016 continued a decades-long increasing trend and is the highest since 1972. The importation of malaria reflects the overall increase in global travel trends to and from areas where malaria is endemic; a transient decrease in the acquisition of cases, predominantly from West Africa, occurred in 2015. In 2016, more cases (absolute number) originated from regions of the world with widespread malaria transmission. Since the early 2000s, worldwide interventions to reduce malaria have been successful; however, progress has plateaued in recent years, the disease remains endemic in many regions, and the use of appropriate prevention measures by travelers remains inadequate. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: The best way to prevent malaria is to take chemoprophylaxis medication during travel to a country where malaria is endemic. Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient's age and medical history, the likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. In 2018, two tafenoquine-based antimalarials were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Arakoda was approved for use by adults for chemoprophylaxis and is available as a weekly dosage that is convenient during travel, which might improve adherence and also can prevent relapses from P. vivax and P. ovale infections. Krintafel was approved for radical cure of P. vivax infections in those >16 years old. In April 2019, intravenous artesunate became the first-line medication for treatment of severe malaria in the United States. Because intravenous artesunate is not FDA approved, it is available from CDC under an investigational new drug protocol. Detailed recommendations for preventing malaria are available to the general public at the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Health care providers should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States and contact the CDC's Malaria Hotline for case management advice when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) and from the Malaria Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713). Persons submitting malaria case reports (care providers, laboratories, and state and local public health officials) should provide complete information because incomplete reporting compromises case investigations and efforts to prevent infections and examine trends in malaria cases. Adherence to recommended malaria prevention strategies is low among U.S. travelers; reasons for nonadherence include prematurely stopping after leaving the area where malaria was endemic, forgetting to take the medication, and experiencing a side effect. Molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html) enables CDC to track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both domestically and internationally. More samples are needed to improve the completeness of antimalarial drug resistance analysis; therefore, CDC requests that blood specimens be submitted for all cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States.","1545-8636:Mace, Kimberly E:Arguin, Paul M:Lucchi, Naomi W:Tan, Kathrine R:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Surveill Summ. 2019 May 17;68(5):1-35. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.ss6805a1.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099769","Malaria Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Center for Global Health, CDC.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.ss6805a1"

However, little is known about sun protection behaviors and sunburn among adults aged 65 years and older. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey to examine the association between sun protection behaviors (sun avoidance, wearing protective clothing, and sunscreen use) and likelihood of having experienced sunburn in the past year. RESULTS: Just over one in ten older adults (13.2%) had experienced sunburn in the past year; sunburn prevalence was nearly twice as high (20.4%) among sun-sensitive older adults. Men, ages 65-69 years, non-Hispanic whites, and those with skin that burns or freckles after repeated sun exposure were more likely to have been sunburned in the past year compared with the respective comparison groups. The only sun protection behavior significantly associated with sunburn was sunscreen use. None of the sun protection behaviors were significantly associated with a decreased risk of sunburn. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The prevalence of sunburn among older adults suggests opportunities to reduce skin cancer risk within this demographic group by preventing overexposure to the sun. The lack of reduced sunburn risk among those who regularly used sun protection may be related to inadequate or inconsistent use of sun protection or the way the sun protection behaviors were measured. Multi-sector approaches to facilitate sun-safety among older adults are warranted and could include targeted efforts focused on those most likely to get sunburned, including men and those with sun-sensitive skin.","1758-5341:Holman, Dawn M:Ding, Helen:Freeman, MaryBeth:Shoemaker, Meredith L:Journal Article:United States:Gerontologist. 2019 May 17;59(Supplement_1):S17-S27. doi: 10.1093/geront/gny173.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100136","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Atlanta, Georgia.:DB Consulting Group Inc., Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/geront/gny173"

OBJECTIVES: We describe EV and PeV infections among children from 2 US study sites aged <1 year and hospitalized with acute infections. For EV- and PeV-negative case-patients, we explored other viral etiologies. METHODS: Participants were aged <1 year, hospitalized during 2016, and had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected for routine diagnostic testing. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical charts, and residual specimens were sent to CDC for confirmatory testing and typing. RESULTS: Of 472 eligible case-patients, CSF specimen was available for 319 (67.6%). Among those, 13 (4.1%) were positive for EV and 11 (3.4%) for PeV. Most case-patients (86.8%, n = 277) were aged <2 months, as were all EV- or PeV-positive case-patients. None of the positive case-patients had underlying conditions, and the chief complaint for 91.7% (n = 22) was fever. Twelve positive case-patients were admitted to intensive care (ICU) and had brief hospital stays (median 2 days). Sequencing revealed a variety of EV types and the predominance of PeV-A3 among the PeV-positive case-patients. CONCLUSIONS: A range of EV and PeV types were associated with acute febrile illnesses leading to hospitalization in children aged <2 months. Approximately half of EV and PeV case-patients were admitted to ICU, but length of hospital stay was brief and illnesses were generally self-limiting. Clinicians should consider EV and PeV infections in infants presenting with febrile illness.","1873-5967:Abedi, Glen R:Messacar, Kevin:Luong, William:Nix, W Allan:Rogers, Shannon:Queen, Krista:Tong, Suxiang:Oberste, M Steven:Watt, James:Rothrock, Gretchen:Dominguez, Samuel:Gerber, Susan I:Watson, John T:Journal Article:Netherlands:J Clin Virol. 2019 Apr 25;116:39-43. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2019.04.005.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100674","Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.

STUDY DESIGN: For this retrospective cohort study, we queried the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia healthcare network's unified electronic health record to identify all 5- to 15-year-old patients who had their first clinical visit for an index concussion at a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia location from July 2012 through June 2013. A 25% random sample (n = 536) were selected. Clinical data were abstracted for their index concussion and all concussion-related visits for 2 years following the index concussion. RESULTS: Overall, 16.2% (n = 87) of patients experienced at least 1 repeat concussion within 2 years of their index concussion. The risk of repeat concussion increased with patient age (9.5% for ages 5-8 years; 10.7% for ages 9-11 years; and 19.8% for ages 12-15 years). After we adjusted for other factors, risk was particularly heightened among patients whose index concussion had a longer clinical course (>30 vs 0-7 days, adjusted risk ratio 1.65 [1.01-2.69]) and greater symptom burden (>11 vs 0-2 symptoms, adjusted risk ratio 2.12 [1.12-3.72]). CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 1 in 6 youth diagnosed with a concussion are diagnosed with a subsequent concussion within 2 years and that several clinical characteristics of the index concussion increase this risk. Identifying factors associated with a repeat injury is essential to inform the clinical management of concussion and direct injury prevention efforts.","1097-6833:Curry, Allison E:Arbogast, Kristy B:Metzger, Kristina B:Kessler, Ronni S:Breiding, Matthew J:Haarbauer-Krupa, Juliet:DePadilla, Lara:Greenspan, Arlene:Master, Christina L:Journal Article:United States:J Pediatr. 2019 May 4. pii: S0022-3476(19)30421-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2019.04.001.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101406","Center for Injury Research and Prevention, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

Ixodes scapularis, commonly referred to as the blacklegged tick, is the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), in the eastern United States. Connecticut has pervasive populations of I. scapularis and remains a hotspot for Lyme disease. A primary aim of this study was to determine if passively collected data on human-biting I. scapularis ticks in Connecticut could serve as a useful proxy for Lyme disease incidence based on the cases reported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH). Data for human-biting I. scapularis ticks submitted to the Tick Testing Laboratory at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES-TTL), and tested for infection with B. burgdorferi s.l., were used to estimate the rate of submitted nymphs, nymphal infection prevalence, and the rate of submitted infected nymphs. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in tick-based measures and Lyme disease incidence with generalized linear and spatial models. In conjunction with land cover and household income data, we used generalized linear mixed effects models to examine the association between tick-based risk estimates and Lyme disease incidence. Between 2007 and 2017, the CAES-TTL received 26,116 I. scapularis tick submissions and the CDPH reported 23,423 Lyme disease cases. The rate of submitted nymphs, nymphal infection prevalence, the rate of submitted infected nymphs, and Lyme disease incidence all decreased over time during this eleven-year period. The rate of submitted nymphs, the rate of submitted infected nymphs, and Lyme disease incidence were spatially correlated, but nymphal infection prevalence was not. Using a mixed modeling approach to predict Lyme disease incidence and account for spatiotemporal structuring of the data, we found the best fitting tested model included a strong, positive association with the rate of submitted infected nymphs and a negative association with the percent of developed land for each county. We show that within counties, submissions of B. burgdorferi s.l. infected nymphs were strongly and positively associated with inter-annual variation in reported Lyme disease cases. Tick-based passive surveillance programs may be useful in providing independent measures of entomological risk, particularly in settings where Lyme disease case reporting practices change substantially over time.","1877-9603:Little, Eliza A H:Anderson, John F:Stafford, Kirby C 3rd:Eisen, Lars:Eisen, Rebecca J:Molaei, Goudarz:Journal Article:Netherlands:Ticks Tick Borne Dis. 2019 Apr 18. pii: S1877-959X(18)30368-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.04.010.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101553","Center for Vector Biology & Zoonotic Diseases, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, 123 Huntington Street, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.:Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO 80521, USA.:Center for Vector Biology & Zoonotic Diseases, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, 123 Huntington Street, New Haven, CT 06511, USA; Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, 60 College Street, PO Box 208034, New Haven, CO 06520-8034, USA.

There are limited publications on national health information systems that continuously generate health data. Given the need to develop these systems, we summarised their current status in low-income and middle-income countries. SETTING: The survey team jointly developed a questionnaire covering policy, planning, legislation and organisation of case reporting, patient monitoring and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems. From January until May 2017, we administered the questionnaire to key informants in 51 Centers for Disease Control country offices. Countries were aggregated for descriptive analyses in Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: Key informants in 15 countries responded to the questionnaire. Several key informants did not answer all questions, leading to different denominators across questions. The Ministry of Health coordinated case reporting, patient monitoring and CRVS systems in 93% (14/15), 93% (13/14) and 53% (8/15) of responding countries, respectively. Domestic financing supported case reporting, patient monitoring and CRVS systems in 86% (12/14), 75% (9/12) and 92% (11/12) of responding countries, respectively. The most common uses for system-generated data were to guide programme response in 100% (15/15) of countries for case reporting, to calculate service coverage in 92% (12/13) of countries for patient monitoring and to estimate the national burden of disease in 83% (10/12) of countries for CRVS. Systems with an electronic component were being used for case reporting, patient monitoring, birth registration and death registration in 87% (13/15), 92% (11/12), 77% (10/13) and 64% (7/11) of responding countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most responding countries have a solid foundation for policy, planning, legislation and organisation of health information systems. Further evaluation is needed to assess the quality of data generated from systems. Periodic evaluations may be useful in monitoring progress in strengthening and harmonising these systems over time.","2044-6055:Suthar, Amitabh Bipin:Khalifa, Aleya:Joos, Olga:Manders, Eric-Jan:Abdul-Quader, Abu:Amoyaw, Frank:Aoua, Camara:Aynalem, Getahun:Barradas, Danielle:Bello, George:Bonilla, Luis:Cheyip, Mireille:Dalhatu, Ibrahim Tijjani:De Klerk, Michael:Dee, Jacob:Hedje, Judith:Jahun, Ibrahim:Jantaramanee, Supiya:Kamocha, Stanley:Lerebours, Leonel:Lobognon, Legre Roger:Lote, Namarola:Lubala, Leopold:Magazani, Alain:Mdodo, Rennatus:Mgomella, George S:Monique, Lattah Asseka:Mudenda, Mphatso:Mushi, Jeremiah:Mutenda, Nicholus:Nicoue, Aime:Ngalamulume, Rogers Galaxy:Ndjakani, Yassa:Nguyen, Tuan Anh:Nzelu, Charles Echezona:Ofosu, Anthony Adofo:Pinini, Zukiswa:Ramirez, Edwin:Sebastian, Victor:Simanovong, Bouathong:Son, Ha Thai:Son, Vo Hai:Swaminathan, Mahesh:Sivile, Suilanji:Teeraratkul, Achara:Temu, Poruan:West, Christine:Xaymounvong, Douangchanh:Yamba, Abel:Yoka, Denis:Zhu, Hao:Ransom, Ray L:Nichols, Erin:Murrill, Christopher S:Rosen, Daniel:Hladik, Wolfgang:Journal Article:England:BMJ Open. 2019 May 16;9(5):e027689. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027689.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101699","Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:International Statistics Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hanoi, Viet Nam.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Accra, Ghana.:Ministere de la Sante et de l'Hygiene Publique, Abidjan, Lagunes, Cote d'Ivoire.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pretoria, South Africa.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lusaka, Zambia.:Ministry of Health, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abuja, Nigeria.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Windhoek, Namibia.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.:Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok, Thailand.:National Department of Health, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.:Ministere de la Sante Publique, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania.:Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania.:Ministry of Health and Social Services, Windhoek, Namibia.:Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, Nigeria.:Ghana Health Service, Accra, Greater Accra, Ghana.:National Department of Health, Pretoria, South Africa.:Servicio Nacional de Salud, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.:Ministry of Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.:Ministry of Health, Hanoi, Viet Nam.:Ministry of Health, Lusaka, Zambia.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Bangkok, Thailand.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027689"

As a consequence, organs from donors showing symptoms of encephalitis (increased probability of infectious encephalitis (IPIE) organs) might be declined. We had previously characterized the risk of IPIE organs using data available to most transplant teams and not requiring special diagnostic tests. If the probability of infection is low, the benefits of a transplant from a donor with suspected infectious encephalitis might outweigh the risk and could be lifesaving for some transplant candidates. METHODS: Using organ transplant data and Cox Proportional Hazards models, we determined liver donor and recipient characteristics predictive of post-transplant or waitlist survival and generated 5-year survival probability curves. We also calculated expected waiting times for an organ offer based on transplant candidate characteristics. Using a limited set of actual cases of infectious encephalitis transmission via transplant, we estimated post-transplant survival curves given an organ from an IPIE donor. RESULTS: 54% (1,256) of patients registered from 2002-2006 who died or were removed from the waiting list due to deteriorated condition within 1 year could have had an at least marginal estimated benefit by accepting an IPIE liver with some probability of infection, with the odds increasing to 86% of patients if the probability of infection was low (5% or less). Additionally, 54% (1,252) were removed from the waiting list prior to their estimated waiting time for a non-IPIE liver and could have benefited from an IPIE liver. CONCLUSION: Improved allocation and utilization of IPIE livers could be achieved by evaluating the patient-specific trade-offs between (i) accepting an IPIE liver and (ii) remaining on the waitlist and accepting a non-IPIE liver after the estimated waiting time.

METHODS: We estimated changes in monthly numbers of visitors to the Republic of Korea (ROK) in 2015 compared to projected values by selected areas. We tested whether areas' experience of a previous SARS outbreak of >/=100 cases or distance to the ROK had a significant effect on travel to the ROK during the MERS outbreak using t-tests and regression models. RESULTS: The percentage changes in visitors from areas with a previous SARS outbreak of >/=100 cases decreased more than the percentage changes in visitors from their counterparts in June (52.4% vs. 23.3%) and July (60.0% vs. 31.4%) during the 2015 MERS outbreak. The percentage changes in visitors from the close and intermediate categories decreased more than the far category. The results from regression models and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that areas with >/=100 SARS cases and closer proximity to the ROK had significantly larger decreases in traveler volumes during the outbreak.

A grounded theory coding approach was used to analyze focus group data from 77 participants. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: economic vulnerability, psychosocial stressors, and health and safety effects. Although workers are aware of the safety hazards associated with their jobs, they believe their immigration status limits employment opportunities leading them to accept poor working conditions. They work through injuries and cope psychologically through minimizing negative health impacts and normalizing work-related injuries and illnesses.

We aimed to compare the immunogenicity of two fIPV doses versus one IPV dose for routine immunisation, and also assessed the immunogenicity of an fIPV booster dose for an outbreak response. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, controlled, inequality, non-inferiority trial in two clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Healthy infants were randomly assigned at 6 weeks to one of four groups: group A received IPV at age 14 weeks and IPV booster at age 22 weeks; group B received IPV at age 14 weeks and fIPV booster at age 22 weeks; group C received IPV at age 6 weeks and fIPV booster at age 22 weeks; and group D received fIPV at 6 weeks and 14 weeks and fIPV booster at age 22 weeks. IPV was administered by needle-syringe as an intramuscular full dose (0.5 mL), and fIPV was administered intradermally (0.1 mL of the IPV formulation was administered using the 0.1 mL HelmJect auto-disable syringe with a Helms intradermal adapter). Both IPV and fIPV were administered on the outer, upper right thigh of infants. The primary outcome was vaccine response to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 at age 22 weeks (routine immunisation) and age 26 weeks (outbreak response). Vaccine response was defined as seroconversion from seronegative (<1:8) at baseline to seropositive (>/=1:8) or four-fold increase in reciprocal antibody titres adjusted for maternal antibody decay and was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (infants who received polio vaccines per group assignment and polio antibody titre results to serotypes 1, 2, and 3 at 6, 22, 23, and 26 weeks of age). The non-inferiority margin was 12.5%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02847026. FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2016 and May 2, 2017, 1076 participants were randomly assigned and included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis: 271 in Group A, 267 in group B, 268 in group C, and 270 in group D. Vaccine response at 22 weeks to two doses of fIPV (group D) was significantly higher (p<0.0001) than to one dose of IPV (groups A and B) for all three poliovirus serotypes: the type 1 response comprised 212 (79% [95% CI 73-83]) versus 305 (57% [53-61]) participants, the type 2 response comprised 173 (64% [58-70]) versus 249 (46% [42-51]) participants, and the type 3 response comprised 196 (73% [67-78]) versus 196 (36% [33-41]) participants. At 26 weeks, the fIPV booster was non-inferior to IPV (group B vs group A) for serotype 1 (-1.12% [90% CI -2.18 to -0.06]), serotype 2 (0.40%, [-2.22 to 1.42]), and serotype 3 (1.51% [-3.23 to -0.21]). Of 129 adverse events, 21 were classified as serious including one death; none were attributed to IPV or fIPV.

Striking changes occurred in the immunoglobulin repertoire, with massive recruitment of naive B cells that subsequently underwent hypermutation. We characterized a large panel of EBOV glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Only a small subset of mAbs that bound glycoprotein by ELISA recognized cell-surface glycoprotein. However, this subset contained all neutralizing mAbs. Several mAbs protected against EBOV disease in animals, including one mAb that targeted an epitope under evolutionary selection during the 2014 outbreak.

RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses indicated the measures reflected the theory. Factorial ANOVAs suggested female teachers had statistically significantly lower mean self-efficacy scores than did male teachers to teach workplace safety and health. Male occupational career and technical education teachers demonstrated higher mean knowledge scores than male teachers in other subjects. Participants not injured at work had higher knowledge scores than those who had been injured.

Gloves (mining or chemical) and headgear (helmet or powered air-purifying respirator) were removed during recovery with hydration ad libitum. Rectal temperature (Tre), skin temperature (Tsk), physiological heat strain (PSI), perceptual heat strain (PeSI), and body heat content were calculated. At the end of the 2-hr trials, Tre remained below 38 degrees C and the magnitude of Tre elevation was not greater than 1 degrees C in all conditions (WD: 0.9, WH: 0.8, WH: 0.7, and PD: 0.6 degrees C).

The increase in Tsk was the highest in WD followed by PD, WH, and PH conditions (all p </= 0.001). Although PSI and PeSI did not indicate severe heat strain during the 2-hr intermittent work period, PSI and PeSI were significantly increased over time (p </= 0.001).

The objective of this study was to evaluate if the test methods being developed for half-facepiece respirators can reasonably be applied to nonpowered full-facepiece-air-purifying respirators (FF-APR). Benchmark RFC test data were collected for three families of FF-APRs (a one-size-only family, a two-size family, and a three-size family). All respirators were equipped with P100 class particulate filters. Respirators were outfitted with a sampling probe to collect an in-mask particle concentration sample in the breathing zone of the wearer. Each of the six respirator facepieces was tested on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 25-subject Bivariate Panel. The RFC test assessed face seal leakage using a PortaCount fit test. Subjects followed the corresponding Occupational Safety and Health Administration-accepted fit test protocol. Two donnings per subject/respirator model combination were performed. The panel passing rate (PPR) (number or percentage of subjects in the panel achieving acceptable fit on at least one of two donnings) was determined for each respirator family at specified fit factor passing levels of 500, 1,000, and 2,000. As a reasonable expectation based on a previous analysis of alpha and beta fit test errors for various panel sizes, the selected PPR benchmark for our study was >75%. At the fit factor passing level of 500 obtained on at least one of two donnings, the PPRs for three-, two-, and one-size families were 100, 79, and 88%, respectively. As the fit factor passing criterion increased from 500 to 1,000 or 2,000, PPRs followed a decreasing trend. Each of the three tested families of FF-APRs are capable of fitting >/=75% of the intended user population at the 500 fit factor passing level obtained on at least one of two donnings.

AIM: We assessed the relationship between CAC and BMD, which has not been well described among younger to middle-aged HIV-infected persons. METHODS: We studied participants with baseline CAC and BMD measures from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected persons enrolled in the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN) during 2004-2006. We used logistic regression to assess the association between detectable CAC (>0 Agatston score) and BMD (g/cm2, T-score), and adjusted for known traditional and HIV-related risk factors. RESULTS: Among 472 participants (76% male, 30% non-Hispanic black, median age 41 years, 71% with HIV RNA <400 copies/mL), the majority had no detectable CAC (82%), but had baseline osteopenia (53%) or osteoporosis (10%). In univariate analysis, participants with detectable CAC had lower femoral neck/total hip T-scores, lower femoral neck/total hip/lumbar spine BMD, and higher rates of osteopenia/osteoporosis. After adjustment for age, all associations were no longer significant; adjustment for traditional risk factors excluding age and HIV-related variables failed to attenuate these associations. CONCLUSIONS: We found aging attenuates the association between detectable CAC and BMD in this cohort. Aging remains an important contributor to non-AIDS-defining illnesses. These data reinforce the importance of developing screening and prevention strategies for ageing HIV-infected persons given their excess risk across a wide spectrum of end-organ complications.","1944-7884:Escota, Gerome:Baker, Jason:Bush, Tim:Conley, Lois:Brooks, John T:Patel, Pragna:Powderly, William:Presti, Rachel:Overton, E Turner:CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)-SUN (Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy) Investigators:Journal Article:United States:J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2019 May 6. doi: 10.1097/QAI.0000000000002092.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107297","Division of Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.:Department of Infectious Diseases, Hennepin County Medical Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.:Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/qai.0000000000002092"

Decisions about ARVs can be supported by the probability that the child has acquired HIV. METHODS: Using 2005-2010 data from Enhanced Perinatal Surveillance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed a tool for use at birth to help predict HIV acquisition of HIV-exposed infants to support ARV management. A logistic regression model, fit using a fully Bayesian approach, was used to determine maternal variables predictive of infant HIV acquisition. We created a score index from these variables, established the sensitivity and specificity of each possible score, and determined the distribution of scores among infants, with and without HIV, in our study population. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis of data from 8740 HIV-exposed infants (176 infected and 8564 uninfected) yielded 4 maternal variables in the perinatal HIV acquisition prediction model: sexually transmitted infection, substance use, last HIV viral load before delivery and ARV use. Using the regression coefficient estimates, we rescaled each possible score to make the maximum score equal to 100. For each score, sensitivity and specificity were determined; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.79. Median index scores for infants with HIV and without HIV were 43 (first quartile 27 and third quartile 60), and 12 (first quartile, 0 and thirs quartile, 29), respectively.

While LARC methods are highly effective for pregnancy prevention, they, as with all nonbarrier methods, do not protect against STIs, including HIV. Studies of the general adolescent population suggest condom use is lower among LARC vs non-LARC hormonal methods users (birth control pill, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring, or injection). Despite the high use of LARC among postpartum teenagers, no studies have examined whether condom use differs by contraceptive method in this population. Objective: To compare condom use among sexually active postpartum teenagers using LARC vs those using non-LARC hormonal methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis using 2012 to 2015 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a multisite and population-based surveillance system that collects data on maternal attitudes, behaviors, and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. We used data from 37 sites. Using multivariable survey-weighted logistic regression, we assessed the association of condom use by contraceptive methods. Participants were teenage mothers (</=19 years) with a recent live birth reporting LARC or non-LARC hormonal method use. Data were analyzed between March 2018 and April 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Condom use with LARC vs condom use with non-LARC hormonal methods. Results: Among the 5480 (weighted N = 245847) postpartum teenage mothers in our sample, most were aged 18 to 19 years, unmarried, had current Medicaid coverage, were first-time mothers, had reported their pregnancy was unintended, and almost half were non-Hispanic white. Overall, condom use was reported by 28.8% of these teenagers. Users of LARC compared with non-LARC hormonal methods were half as likely to use condoms (17.8% vs 35.6%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41-0.60). Users of IUDs (15.1%) were less likely to report condom use than those using an implant (21.5%; aPR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98), patch, ring, or injection users (24.9%; aPR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.79), and pill users (47.2%; aPR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.25-0.40). Conclusions and Relevance: Self-reported condom use was low overall among postpartum teenage mothers and lower among users of LARC vs non-LARC hormonal methods. Given the high rates of STIs among teenage mothers combined with higher use of LARC among postpartum teenaged mothers, interventions to promote condom use for STI/HIV prevention during the postpartum period are critically important.","2168-6211:Kortsmit, Katherine:Williams, Letitia:Pazol, Karen:Smith, Ruben A:Whiteman, Maura:Barfield, Wanda:Koumans, Emilia:Kourtis, Athena:Harrison, Leslie:Bauman, Brenda:Warner, Lee:Journal Article:United States:JAMA Pediatr. 2019 May 20. pii: 2733859. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.1136.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107513","Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Research Participation Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.:Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.1136"

The purpose of this report is (1) to review and summarize the recent cancer cost estimates and (2) to illustrate how the estimated cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination might change when these recent cost estimates are applied. Our literature search yielded 6 studies that provided updated medical care cost estimates for 5 HPV-associated cancers. We found that applying the current cancer cost estimates had a notable impact on the estimated medical costs averted by HPV vaccination over an extended time frame (100 years), and a moderate impact on the estimated cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by HPV vaccination. For example, for catch-up vaccination of teenagers and young adults, applying the more recent cancer costs reduced the estimated cost per QALY gained by about $12,400. The cost studies we identified in our literature review are up-to-date and based on reliable data sources from United States settings, and can inform future studies of HPV vaccination cost-effectiveness in the United States.

Our dataset includes young, adult female respondents from questionnaire data collected in the National Center for Health Statistics' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2014. The empirical approach implements a doubly robust estimation procedure, based on inverse probability of treatment weighting. For robustness, we implement several specifications for the propensity model and the outcomes model. We find no consistent association between HPV vaccination and condom usage or frequency of sex. Specifically, we find no evidence that HPV vaccination is associated with condom usage or with whether a person had sex more than 52 or more than 104 times per year. We find inconsistent evidence that HPV vaccination is associated with a person having sex more than 12 times per year.

OBJECTIVE: To measure associations between e-cigarette use in public places and social norms among youth. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: School-based. PARTICIPANTS: 24 353 never tobacco users in US 6th-12th grades who completed the 2016-2017 National Youth Tobacco Surveys. EXPOSURE: Individuals were classified as exposed in public places within the past 30 days to: (1) neither e-cigarette secondhand aerosol (SHA) nor combustible tobacco secondhand smoke (SHS); (2) SHA only; (3) SHS only; and (4) both SHA and SHS. OUTCOMES: Outcomes were overestimation of peer e-cigarette use (a measure of descriptive norms), harm perception and susceptibility. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression (p<0.05). RESULTS: Overall prevalence of SHS and SHA exposure in public places was 46.6% and 18.3%, respectively. SHA exposure in public places was associated with increased odds of overestimating peer e-cigarette use (adjusted OR (AOR): 1.83; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.58) and decreased odds of perceiving e-cigarettes as harmful (AOR: 0.63; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.79), compared with those exposed to neither emission. SHA exposure in public places was also associated with increased susceptibility to using e-cigarettes (AOR: 2.26; 95% CI 1.82 to 2.81) and cigarettes (AOR: 1.51; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.90). E-cigarette harm perception was lower among students in jurisdictions with no comprehensive clean indoor air laws (AOR: 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88) or cigarette-only laws (AOR: 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99) than in those prohibiting both cigarette and e-cigarette use in public places.

We estimated awardee-specific cost per woman served for all activities, clinical screening delivery services, screening promotion interventions, and overarching program support activities. RESULTS: The total cost per woman served by the awardees varied greatly from $205 (10th percentile) to $499 (90th percentile).

However, there is a gap in how often providers counsel patients about SUDEP. One potential solution is to electronically prompt clinicians to provide counseling via automated detection of risk factors in electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated (1) the feasibility and generalizability of using regular expressions to identify risk factors in EMRs and (2) barriers to generalizability. METHODS: Data included physician notes for 3000 patients from one medical center (home) and 1000 from five additional centers (away). Through chart review, we identified three SUDEP risk factors: (1) generalized tonic-clonic seizures, (2) refractory epilepsy, and (3) epilepsy surgery candidacy. Regular expressions of risk factors were manually created with home training data, and performance was evaluated with home test and away test data. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F-measure. Generalizability was defined as an absolute decrease in performance by <0.10 for away versus home test data. To evaluate underlying barriers to generalizability, we identified causes of errors seen more often in away data than home data. To demonstrate how small revisions can improve generalizability, we removed three ""boilerplate"" standard text phrases from away notes and repeated performance. RESULTS: We observed high performance in home test data (F-measure range = 0.86-0.90), and low to high performance in away test data (F-measure range = 0.53-0.81). After removing three boilerplate phrases, away performance improved (F-measure range = 0.79-0.89) and generalizability was achieved for nearly all measures. The only significant barrier to generalizability was use of boilerplate phrases, causing 104 of 171 errors (61%) in away data. SIGNIFICANCE: Regular expressions are a feasible and probably a generalizable method to identify variables related to SUDEP risk. Our methods may be implemented to create large patient cohorts for research and to generate electronic prompts for SUDEP counseling.","1528-1167:Barbour, Kristen:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0293-0108:Hesdorffer, Dale C:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1783-5381:Tian, Niu:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9380-0207:Yozawitz, Elissa G:McGoldrick, Patricia E:Wolf, Steven:McDonough, Tiffani L:Nelson, Aaron:Loddenkemper, Tobias:Basma, Natasha:Johnson, Stephen B:Grinspan, Zachary M:Epilepsy Research Fund (Epilepsy Research Risk Detection and Prevention of Death Fund):U01DP006089/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:Journal Article:United States:Epilepsia. 2019 May 21. doi: 10.1111/epi.15966.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111463","Division of Child Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.:Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Saul R.

METHODS: Data from 1802 HIV-negative children between 1-59 months old enrolled in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study with severe or very severe pneumonia during 2011-14 were used to build a parsimonious multivariable model predicting mortality using backwards stepwise logistic regression. The PERCH severity score, derived from model coefficients, was validated on a second, temporally discrete dataset of a further 1819 cases and compared to other available scores using the c-statistic. RESULTS: Predictors of mortality, across seven low and middle-income countries, were: age <1 year, female sex, 3 or more days of illness prior to presentation to hospital, low weight-for-height, unresponsiveness, deep breathing, hypoxemia, grunting and the absence of cough. The model discriminated well between those who died and those who survived (c-statistic: 0.84), but the predictive capacity of the PERCH 5-stratum score derived from the coefficients was moderate (c=0.76). The performance of the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score was similar (c=0.76). The number of WHO danger signs demonstrated the highest discrimination (c=0.82; 1.5% died if no danger signs, 10% if 1 danger sign and 33% if 2 or more danger signs). CONCLUSIONS: The PERCH severity score could be used to interpret geographic variations in pneumonia mortality and etiology. The number of WHO danger signs on presentation to hospital could be the most useful, of the currently available tools, to aid clinical management of pneumonia.","1537-6591:Gallagher, Katherine E:Knoll, Maria D:Prosperi, Chrissy:Baggett, Henry C:Brooks, W Abdullah:Feiken, Daniel R:Hammitt, Laura L:Howie, Stephen R C:Kotloff, Karen L:Levine, Orin S:Madhi, Shabir A:Murdoch, David R:O'Brien, Katherine L:Thea, Donald M:Awori, Juliet O:Baillie, Vicky L:Ebruke, Bernard E:Goswami, Doli:Kamau, Alice:Maloney, Susan A:Moore, David P:Mwananyanda, Lawrence:Olutunde, Emmanuel O:Seidenberg, Phil:Sissoko, Seydou:Sylla, Mamadou:Thamthitiwat, Somsak:Zaman, Khalequ:Scott, J Anthony G:PERCH Study Group:Journal Article:United States:Clin Infect Dis. 2019 May 6. pii: 5485888. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz350.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111870","Department of infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.:Department of International Health, International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.:Division of Global Health Protection, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Global Disease Detection Center, Thailand Ministry of Public Health-US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration, Nonthaburi, Thailand.:Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.:International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka and Matlab, Bangladesh.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.:Medical Research Council Unit, Basse, The Gambia.:Department of Paediatrics University of Auckland, New Zealand.:Division of Infectious Disease and Tropical Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Vaccine Development, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.:Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington.:Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Department of Science and Technology/National Research Foundation: Vaccine Preventable Diseases Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.:Microbiology Unit, Canterbury Health Laboratories, Christchurch, New Zealand.:Department of Global Health, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.:Division of Global HIV and TB, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:Department of Paediatrics & Child Health, Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital and University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.:Center for Global Health and Development, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.:EQUIP-Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.:Department of Emergency Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.:Centre pour le Developpement des Vaccins (CVD-Mali), Bamako, Mali.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/cid/ciz350"

SETTING: USA, nationally representative survey of 2029 municipalities. PARTICIPANTS: Municipal officials (e.g. city/town managers or planners; n 1853). RESULTS: Overall, 67 % of municipalities reported incentives to support farmers' markets, 34 % reported incentives to encourage opening new supermarkets, and 14 % reported incentives to help existing convenience or corner stores. Municipality characteristics significantly associated with incentive use were larger population size (all settings), location in Midwest v. West (supermarkets, smaller stores), higher poverty level (farmers' markets) and </=50 % of the population non-Hispanic White (supermarkets, smaller stores). The most commonly reported individual incentives were permission of sales on city property for farmers' markets, tax credits for supermarkets and linkage to revitalization projects for smaller stores. CONCLUSIONS: Most municipalities offered food retail incentives for farmers' markets, but fewer used incentives to open new supermarkets or assist existing smaller stores.

Spray polyurethane foam workers have the potential to be exposed to TCPP during application. In this study, we determined exposure to TCPP and concentrations of the urinary biomarker bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCPP) among 29 spray polyurethane foam workers over 2 work days. Work was conducted at residential or commercial facilities using both open-cell (low density) and closed-cell (high density) foam. Study participants provided two personal air samples (Day 1 and Day 2), two hand wipe samples (Pre-shift Day 2 and Post-shift Day 2), and two spot urine samples (Pre-shift Day 1 and Post-shift Day 2). Bulk samples of cured spray foam were also analyzed. Sprayers were found to have significantly higher TCPP geometric mean (GM) concentration in personal air samples (87.1 mug/m(3)), compared to helpers (30.2 mug/m(3); p = 0.025). A statistically significant difference was observed between TCPP pre- and post-shift hand wipe GM concentrations (p = 0.004). Specifically, TCPP GM concentration in post-shift hand wipe samples of helpers (106,000 ng/sample) was significantly greater than pre-shift (27,300 ng/sample; p < 0.001). The GM concentration of the urinary biomarker BCPP (23.8 mug/g creatinine) was notably higher than the adult male general population (0.159 mug/g creatinine, p < 0.001). Urinary BCPP GM concentration increased significantly from Pre-shift Day 1 to Post-shift Day 2 for sprayers (p = 0.013) and helpers (p = 0.009).

The lack of estimates of the sensitivity of collections and lack of a numerical association between relative and the absolute density of adult Ae. aegypti represent a significant gap in vector surveillance. Here, we describe the use of sequential removal sampling to estimate absolute numbers of indoor resting Ae. aegypti and to calculate calibration coefficients for timed Prokopack aspirator collections in the city of Merida, Yucatan State, Mexico. The study was performed in 200 houses that were selected based on recent occurrence of Aedes-borne viral illness in residents. Removal sampling occurred in 10-minute sampling rounds performed sequentially until no Ae. aegypti adult was collected for 3 hours or over 2 consecutive 10-minute periods. RESULTS: A total of 3439 Ae. aegypti were collected. The sensitivity of detection of positive houses in the first sampling round was 82.5% for any adult Ae. aegypti, 78.5% for females, 75.5% for males and 73.3% for blood-fed females. The total number of Ae. aegypti per house was on average ~5 times higher than numbers collected for the first sampling round. There was a positive linear relationship between the relative density of Ae. aegypti collected during the first 10-min round and the absolute density for all adult metrics. Coefficients from the linear regression were used to calibrate numbers from 10-min collections into estimates of absolute indoor Ae. aegypti density for all adults, females and males. CONCLUSIONS: Exhaustive removal sampling represents a promising method for quantification of absolute indoor Ae. aegypti density, leading to improved entomological estimates of mosquito distribution, a key measure in the assessments of the risk pathogen transmission, disease modeling and the evaluation of vector control interventions.","1756-3305:Koyoc-Cardena, Edgar:Medina-Barreiro, Anuar:Cohuo-Rodriguez, Azael:Pavia-Ruz, Norma:Lenhart, Audrey:Ayora-Talavera, Guadalupe:Dunbar, Mike:Manrique-Saide, Pablo:Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo:Usaid:Aid-oaa-f-16-00094/usaid:CDC: OADS BAA 2016-N-17844/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:108412/idrc:Yuc-2017-03-01-556/conacyt:Journal Article:England:Parasit Vectors. 2019 May 21;12(1):250. doi: 10.1186/s13071-019-3503-y.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113454","Unidad Colaborativa de Bioensayos Entomologicos, Campus de Ciencias.

Unfortunately, comprehensive assessments of frailty requiring physical assessments and extensive medical record review are not often feasible in time- and resource-limited settings common to studies of influenza and influenza vaccines. METHODS: We developed a 5-question frailty short interview, and implemented it in a multicenter, hospital-based study of influenza over two years. Frailty status defined by the frailty short interview was compared to a validated frailty index based on medical record review of 59 parameters. Agreement between the two frailty measures was assessed, and multivariable linear regression models were used to explore differences between the measures. The association between each frailty measure and likelihood of influenza vaccination was also assessed. RESULTS: During the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons, 2070 adult patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness were enrolled and included in analyses. Frailty was frequently identified in the study population; 43% of participants were defined as frail by the frailty short interview and 32% by frailty index. Responses to the frailty short interview were only moderately correlated with the frailty index, and agreement between the two frailty measures was low. Women were more likely to be defined as frail by the frailty short interview than men. White individuals were more likely than other races to be defined as frail by the frailty index. Increasing frailty index was associated with increased likelihood of influenza vaccination, but the frailty short interview was not associated with vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The frailty short interview provided a feasible and consistent measure of frailty across study hospitals and study years. However, its modest correlation with the frailty index and differential association with likelihood of influenza vaccination highlight differences in the conceptualization of frailty.","1873-2518:Petrie, Joshua G:Martin, Emily T:Zhu, Yuwei:Wyatt, Dayna G:Kaniclides, Anne:Ferdinands, Jill M:Monto, Arnold S:Trabue, Christopher:Talbot, H Keipp:Journal Article:Netherlands:Vaccine. 2019 May 18. pii: S0264-410X(19)30686-3. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.05.051.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31113675","Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, United States.

STUDY DESIGN: National, random samples of American Academy of Pediatrics members were surveyed in 2006, 2010, and 2017 on practices and attitudes regarding overweight and obesity (analytic n = 655, 592, and 558, respectively). Using logistic regression models (controlling for pediatrician and practice characteristics), we examined survey year with predicted values (PVs), including body mass index (BMI) assessment across 2006, 2010, and 2017 and practices and attitudes in 2006 and 2017. RESULTS: Pediatrician respondents in 2017 were significantly more likely than in 2006 and 2010 to report calculating and plotting BMI at every well-child visit, with 96% of 2017 pediatricians reporting they do this. Compared with 2006, in 2017 pediatricians were more likely to discuss family behaviors related to screen time, sugar-sweetened beverages, and eating meals together, P < .001 for all.

We used retrospective CLSP data to analyze racial/ethnic differences in lupus manifestations and in the timing and risk of developing severe manifestations. METHODS: 724 patients with SLE were retrospectively identified. Prevalence ratios (PR) of SLE manifestations were calculated using Poisson regression models stratified by race/ethnicity and adjusted for sex, age at SLE diagnosis, and disease duration. We studied onset of severe SLE manifestations after SLE diagnosis using Kaplan-Meier methods to examine time-to-event and Cox proportional hazards regressions to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Whites were the referent group in all analyses. RESULTS: Blacks, APIs, and Hispanics had increased prevalence of renal manifestations [PR 1.74 (95%CI: 1.40-2.16), PR 1.68 (95%CI: 1.38-2.05), PR 1.35 (95%CI: 1.05-1.74)], respectively. Furthermore, Blacks had increased prevalence of neurologic manifestations [PR 1.49 (95%CI: 1.12-1.98)] and both Blacks [PR 1.09 (95%CI: 1.04-1.15)] and APIs [PR 1.07 (95%CI: 1.01-1.13)] had increased prevalence of hematologic manifestations. Blacks, APIs, and Hispanics, respectively, had higher risk of developing lupus nephritis [HR 2.4 (95%CI: 1.6-3.8), HR 4.3 (95%CI: 2.9-6.4), HR 2.3 (95%CI: 1.4-3.8)] and thrombocytopenia [HR 2.3 (95%CI: 1.1-4.4), HR 2.3 (95%CI: 1.3-4.2), HR 2.2 (95%CI: 1.1-4.7)]. APIs and Hispanics had higher risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome [HR 2.5 (95%CI: 1.4-4.4), HR 2.6 (95%CI: 1.3-5.1), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first epidemiologic study comparing lupus manifestations among four major racial/ethnic groups. We found 1) substantial differences in the prevalence of several clinical SLE manifestations among racial/ethnic groups, and 2) that Blacks, APIs, and Hispanics are at increased risk of developing several severe manifestations following SLE diagnosis.

PrEP scale-up strategies and clinical practice are currently being informed by modeling studies, which have estimated the impact of PrEP in adult and adolescent MSM populations separately. This partitioning may miss important effects or yield biased estimates by excluding dependencies between populations. METHODS: We combined two published models of HIV transmission among adults and adolescent MSM. We simulated an HIV epidemic among MSM aged 13-39 without PrEP, with PrEP for adult MSM ages (19-39) and with the addition of PrEP for adolescents ages (16-18), comparing percent of incident infections averted (impact), the number of person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence. RESULTS: PrEP use among eligible 19-39 year old MSM averted 29.0% of infections and reduced HIV prevalence from 23.2% to 17.0% over ten years in the population as a whole. Despite being ineligible for PrEP in this scenario, prevalence among sexually active 18 year-olds declined from 6.0% to 4.3% due to reduced transmissions across age cohorts. The addition of PrEP for adolescents ages 16-18 had a small impact on the overall epidemic, further reducing overall prevalence from 17.0% to 16.8%; however prevalence among the sexually active 18 year-olds further declined from 4.3% to 3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP use among adults may significantly reduce HIV prevalence among MSM and may also have significant downstream effects on HIV incidence among adolescents; PrEP targeting adolescents remains an important intervention for HIV prevention.","1932-6203:Hamilton, Deven T:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4334-958X:Rosenberg, Eli S:Jenness, Samuel M:Sullivan, Patrick S:Wang, Li Yan:Dunville, Richard L:Barrios, Lisa C:Aslam, Maria:Goodreau, Steven M:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1009-5763:Journal Article:United States:PLoS One. 2019 May 22;14(5):e0217315. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217315. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116802","Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.:Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University at Albany School of Public Health, State University of New York, Rensselaer, New York, United States of America.:Department of Epidemiology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Department of Global Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Division of Adolescent and School Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Program and Performance Improvement Office National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Department of Anthropology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0217315"

Previous analyses of invasion-related proteins revealed that Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum mainly differed in copy numbers of secreted MEDLE proteins and insulinase-like proteases and sequences of mucin-type glycoproteins. Recently, Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I was identified as a novel zoonotic pathogen in humans. In this study, we sequenced its genome and conducted a comparative genomic analysis. RESULTS: The genome of Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I has gene content and organization similar to C. parvum and other intestinal Cryptosporidium species sequenced to date. A total of 3783 putative protein-encoding genes were identified in the genome, 3525 of which are shared by Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I and three major human-pathogenic Cryptosporidium species, C. parvum, C. hominis, and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. The metabolic pathways are almost identical among these four Cryptosporidium species. Compared with C. parvum, a major reduction in gene content in Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I is in the number of telomeric genes encoding MEDLE proteins (two instead of six) and insulinase-like proteases (one instead of two). Highly polymorphic genes between the two species are mostly subtelomeric ones encoding secretory proteins, most of which have higher dN/dS ratios and half are members of multiple gene families. In particular, two subtelomeric ABC transporters are under strong positive selection. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I possesses genome organization, gene content, metabolic pathways and invasion-related proteins similar to the common human-pathogenic Cryptosporidium species, reaffirming its human-pathogenic nature. The loss of some subtelomeric genes encoding insulinase-like proteases and secreted MEDLE proteins and high sequence divergence in secreted pathogenesis determinants could contribute to the biological differences among human-pathogenic Cryptosporidium species.","1471-2164:Xu, Zhixiao:Guo, Yaqiong:Roellig, Dawn M:Feng, Yaoyu:Xiao, Lihua:31630078/National Natural Science Foundation of China:31602042/National Natural Science Foundation of China:Journal Article:England:BMC Genomics. 2019 May 22;20(1):406. doi: 10.1186/s12864-019-5788-9.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117941","State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China.:Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.:Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.:State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China. yyfeng@scau.edu.cn.:Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China. yyfeng@scau.edu.cn.:Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China. lxiao@scau.edu.cn.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12864-019-5788-9"

Information about those MSM and TGW who do not sell sex is necessary to guide HIV prevention and treatment efforts. METHODS: We conducted respondent-driven sampling (RDS) surveys among MSM and TGW in Port Moresby, Lae, and Mt. Hagen, PNG from in 2016 and 2017. Eligibility criteria was: aged > 12 years, born male, could speak English or Tok Pisin and had oral or anal sex with another person born male in the past 6 months. Participants were interviewed face-to-face and offered rapid HIV testing. Weighted data analysis was conducted using RDS-Analyst (v. 0.62). RESULTS: We enrolled 400 participants in Port Moresby, 352 in Lae, and 111 in Mt. Hagen. In the last six months, 73.2% of MSM/TGW in Port Moresby, 77.9% in Lae, and 75.9% in Mt. Hagen, had a concurrent sexual partnership. Upwards of 70% of MSM/TGW in all three cities had sex with a woman in the same period. Less than half of MSM/TGW had ever tested for HIV. HIV prevalence among MSM/TGW was 8.5% in Port Moresby and 6.9% in Lae. Among participants in Mt. Hagen it was 1.3%. HIV was associated with not having sex with a woman in the last six months and sexually transmitted disease symptoms in the last 12 months in Port Moresby and Lae. In Port Moresby, it was also associated with an uncut foreskin, and in Lae with earning income in the formal sector and being unable to rely on other MSM or TGW to accompany them to healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The large proportion of MSM and TGW with concurrent sexual partnerships, combined with the low testing coverage, indicates strong potential for the spread of HIV. The different correlates of HIV in Port Moresby and Lae highlight the importance of conducting surveys in multiple locations and using data to develop locally appropriate interventions even within a country.","1471-2458:Hakim, Avi J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6754-6241:Coy, Kelsey:Badman, Steven G:Willie, Barne:Narokobi, Rebecca:Gabuzzi, Josephine:Pekon, Simon:Kupul, Martha:Hou, Parker:Aeno, Herick:Boli, Ruthy Neo:Nembari, Joshua:Ase, Sophie:Amos, Angelyne:Dala, Nick:Weikum, Damian:Callens, Steven:Kaldor, John M:Vallely, Andrew J:Kelly-Hanku, Angela:Kauntim mi tu Study Team:Journal Article:England:BMC Public Health. 2019 May 22;19(1):623. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-6942-7.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117978","US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global HIV and Tuberculosis, 1600 Clifton Rd, NE, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA. hxv8@cdc.gov.:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global HIV and Tuberculosis, 1600 Clifton Rd, NE, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.:Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney, Wallace Wurth Building, High St, Kensington, NSW, 2052, Australia.:Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, Homat Street, Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, 441, Papua New Guinea.:Papua New Guinea National Department of Health, AOPI Centre, Waigani Drive, P O Box 807, Waigani, Port Moresby, National Capital District, 131, Papua New Guinea.:University of Ghent, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 25, 9000, Ghent, East Flanders, Belgium.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12889-019-6942-7"

To achieve a greater understanding of the occupational risk factors, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) funded a low back health effects consortium, which performed several surveillance studies throughout the United States. This study combines data from the consortium research groups resulting in a data set with nearly 2000 workers in various regions of the country. The purpose of this paper is to examine prevalence and personal risk factors of low back health effects among these workers. METHODS: There were three common questions regarding history of low back health effects in the past 12 months including 1) have you had LBP lasting 7 days, 2) have you sought medical care for LBP, and 3) have you taken time off work due to LBP. The questionnaire included demographic questions. There were five data collections institutions or sites including NIOSH, Ohio State University, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Texas A&M University, and University of Utah. RESULTS: The 12-month period prevalence of low back pain lasting 7 days, seeking medical care, and lost time due to LBP were 25, 14 and 10%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in gender, age or weight between cases and non-cases for any prevalence measure. The height of workers was significantly greater in the cases compared to non-cases for all three prevalence definitions. There were significant differences among the sites on the prevalence of seeking medical care for LBP and lost time due to LBP. The Ohio State University had significantly higher prevalence rates for seeking medical care and lost time due to LBP than University of Wisconsin, University of Utah, or Texas A&M University. CONCLUSION: LBP, the least severe low back health effect studied, had the highest prevalence (25%) and lost time due to LBP, the most severe low back health effect studied, had the lowest prevalence (10%) among nearly 2000 US manual material handling workers. There was a significant site or regional influence in prevalence rates for seeking medical care and lost time due to LBP.","1471-2474:Ferguson, Sue A:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1193-2869:Merryweather, Andrew:Thiese, Matthew S:Hegmann, Kurt T:Lu, Ming-Lun:Kapellusch, Jay M:Marras, William S:RO1OH010916/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health:Journal Article:England:BMC Musculoskelet Disord. 2019 May 22;20(1):243. doi: 10.1186/s12891-019-2594-0.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118009","Spine Research Institute, The Ohio State University, 210 Baker Systems, 1971 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. ferguson.4@osu.edu.:Rocky Mountain Center for Occupational & Environmental Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah, 391 Chipeta Way, Suite C, Salt Lake City, UT, 84108, USA.:National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Taft Laboratories, 1090 Tusculum Ave. MS C-24, Cincinnati, OH, 45226, USA.:Occupational Science & Technology, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, P.O.

We compare these rates to those of other pediatric populations and identify care disparities within our cohort. OBJECTIVE: Describe the frequency of preventive care services and health behaviors by young people with FXS, and identify disparities in care. METHODS: We assessed four preventive care outcomes and the total number of preventive care guidelines met among individuals under 21 years from the ongoing Fragile X Online Registry with Accessible Research Database (N=406) using data from 2012 to 2015. We used adjusted odds ratios (AORs) from multiple logistic regression models to describe associations between demographic factors and preventive care outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of our sample met dental care guidelines, 55.4% met influenza vaccination guidelines, 92.1% met immunization guidelines, and 24.4% met physical activity (PA) guidelines. Compared to children six to 10 years, younger children were less likely to have seen a dentist as recommended (AOR: 0.26) and young adults aged 16-20 were less likely to have received immunizations (AOR: 0.14) or to have engaged in recommended PA (AOR: 0.29). Black participants (AOR: 0.25) were less likely to have received an influenza vaccination than white participants. Individuals with autism (AOR: 0.25) were less likely to have sufficient PA, while individuals with hypersensitivity were more likely to have sufficient PA (AOR: 2.37) than unaffected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of young people with FXS that meet basic recommendations in preventive care guidelines varies according to health condition and demographic characteristics.

The TODAY clinical trial of youth recently diagnosed with T2D collected healthcare and related cost information from the largest cohort studied to date.

Data were collected by surveys and diaries to document frequency of use of diabetes care (excluding study laboratory tests), non-diabetes care services and treatments, caregiver time, and expenses related to exercise and dietary activities recommended for patients. Economic costs were derived by applying national cost values to the reported utilization frequency data. Annual medical costs in the first year varied by treatment group, averaging $1798 in those assigned to metformin alone (M), $2971 to combination drug therapy with metformin + rosiglitazone (M+R), and $2092 to metformin + an intensive lifestyle and behavior change program (M+L). Differences were primarily due to costs related to combination drug therapy. Adult caregiver support costs were higher for participants in the lifestyle program, which was delivered in weekly sessions in the first six months. Expenses for purchases to enhance diet and exercise change did not vary by treatment assignment. In year 2, medication costs increased in M and M+L due to the initiation of insulin in subjects who failed to maintain glycemic control on the assigned treatment.

Poor inter-assessor agreement with their use poses a concern that may lead to different and dangerous risk conclusions. TREXMO (v1, 2016), a web tool providing parameter translations between six exposure models under REACH, is expected to improve the inter-assessor agreement. In this study, 18 assessors performed exposure assessment for six exposure situations within and outside the framework of this translation tool. In more than half of the evaluated cases, the results showed better agreement between assessors selecting the exposure parameters within the framework of TREXMO than when manually coding. The most affected were the parameters related to activity (such as ""handling types"" of Stoffenmanager) and exposure control (such as local controls). Furthermore, the agreement between the estimates calculated by different assessors was also improved when performing the translations between the models.

WPV type 2 (WPV2) was declared eradicated in 2015; WPV type 3 has not been detected since 2012 (1). After the certification of the eradication of WPV2, a global switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV, containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3) was completed in April 2016.

Afghanistan and Pakistan reported their lowest annual number of WPV cases (22) in 2017; however, 33 WPV1 cases were reported in 2018. During January-March 2019 (as of May 3), 12 WPV1 cases had been reported worldwide, four more than the eight reported during the corresponding period in 2018. The occurrence of polio cases caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is rare and occurs where oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) coverage has been low and vaccine virus reverts to neurovirulence (3). Eight countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, and Syria) reported 210 cVDPV cases during 2017-2019 (as of May 3). Reaching children during supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), accessing mobile populations at high risk, and variations in surveillance performance represent ongoing challenges. Innovative efforts to vaccinate every child and strengthen coordination efforts between Afghanistan and Pakistan will help achieve eradication.

METHODS: We assessed the responses of 1656 cancer survivors to a survey with both closed- and open-ended questions about cancer-related financial sacrifices they and their family experienced and evaluated differences in financial sacrifice by reported levels of cancer-related debt. RESULTS: The most commonly reported financial sacrifices included cutbacks on household budgets, challenges with health care insurance and costs, career/self-advancement constraints, reduction/depletion of assets, and inability to pay bills. Survivors who incurred $10,000 or more in debt were significantly more likely to report social and economic impacts, including housing concerns and strained relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates both the frequency with which cancer survivors and families must make financial sacrifices as a result of their cancer, and the variety of forms that this sacrifice can take, even for individuals who have health insurance. The many types of financial hardship create challenges that are unique to each survivor and family.

HCC prognosis is associated with diagnosis at an early stage. We examined the prevalence and correlates of 6-monthly HCC surveillance in a cohort of HCV-infected cirrhotic patients. METHODS: Data were obtained from the medical records of patients receiving care from four hospitals between January 2011 and December 2016. Frequencies and logistic regression were conducted. RESULTS: Of 2,933 HCV-infected cirrhotic patients, most were >/= 60 years old (68.5%), male (62.2%), White (65.8%), and had compensated cirrhosis (74.2%). The median follow-up period was 3.5 years. Among these patients, 10.9% were consistently screened 6 monthly and 21.4% were never screened. Patients with a longer history of cirrhosis (AOR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.80-0.93) were less likely to be screened 6 monthly while decompensated cirrhotic patients (AOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.06-1.81) and cirrhotic patients between 18 and 44 years (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.07-3.74) were more likely to be screened 6 monthly compared to compensated cirrhotic patients and patients 60 years and older respectively. There were no significant differences by race, gender, or insurance type. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of consistent HCC surveillance remains low despite formalized recommendations. One in five patients was never surveilled. Patients with a longer history of cirrhosis were less likely to be surveilled consistently despite their greater HCC risk. Improving providers' knowledge about current HCC surveillance guidelines, educating patients about the benefits of consistent HCC surveillance, and systemic interventions like clinical reminders and standing HCC surveillance protocols can improve guideline-concordant surveillance in clinical practice.","1941-6636:Abara, Winston E:Spradling, P:Zhong, Y:Moorman, A:Teshale, E H:Rupp, L:Gordon, S C:Schmidt, M:Boscarino, J A:Daida, Y G:Holmberg, S D:CHeCS Investigators:Journal Article:United States:J Gastrointest Cancer. 2019 May 23. pii: 10.1007/s12029-019-00255-4. doi: 10.1007/s12029-019-00255-4.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124041","Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Mailstop G-37, Atlanta, GA, 30333, USA. wabara@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Mailstop G-37, Atlanta, GA, 30333, USA.:Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.:Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, OR, USA.:Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA.:Kaiser Permanente, Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1007/s12029-019-00255-4"

DESIGN: Controlled interrupted time series. METHODS: We convened a CDI prevention collaborative with healthcare facilities in Orange County to reduce CDI incidence in the region. Collaborative participants received onsite infection control and antimicrobial stewardship assessments, interactive learning and discussion sessions, and an interfacility transfer communication improvement initiative during June 2015-June 2016. We used segmented regression to evaluate changes in monthly hospital-onset (HO) and community-onset (CO) CDI rates for ACHs. The baseline period comprised 17 months (January 2014-June 2015) and the follow-up period comprised 28 months (September 2015-December 2017). All 25 Orange County ACHs were included in the CO-CDI model to account for direct and indirect effects of the collaborative. For comparison, we assessed HO-CDI and CO-CDI rates among 27 ACHs in 3 San Francisco Bay Area counties. RESULTS: HO-CDI rates in the 15 participating Orange County ACHs decreased 4% per month (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97; P &lt; .0001) during the follow-up period compared with the baseline period and 3% (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .002) per month compared to the San Francisco Bay Area nonparticipant ACHs. Orange County CO-CDI rates declined 2% per month (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00; P = .03) between the baseline and follow-up periods. This decline was not statistically different from the San Francisco Bay Area ACHs (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00; P = .09).

METHODS: Active prospective surveillance for intussusception was conducted in eight hospitals from September 2013-December 2017. Retrospective case enrolment was done at one hospital from July 2012-August 2013. Demographic characteristics, symptom onset and rotavirus vaccine status were ascertained. Using the self-controlled case-series method, we estimated age-adjusted incidence-rate ratios within 1-7, 8-21, and 1-21 days of rotavirus vaccination in children aged 28-275 days at onset of symptoms. In addition, age-matched controls were enrolled for a subset of cases (n=169), and a secondary analysis performed. RESULTS: There were 346 cases included in the case-series analysis. Post-dose one, there were zero intussusception cases within 1-7 days, and five cases within 8-21 days of vaccination. Post-dose two, 15 cases occurred within 1-7 days, and 18 cases within 8-21 days of vaccination.

Similarly, there was no increased risk 8-21 days after the first (RI: 4.01; 95% CI 0.87-10.56) or second dose (RI: 0.96; 95% CI 0.52-1.60). Results were similar for the case-control analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of intussusception in the 21 days after the first or second dose of RV1 was not higher than the background risk among South Africa infants.","1537-6591:Groome, Michelle J:Tate, Jacqueline E:Arnold, Marion:Chitnis, Milind:Cox, Sharon:de Vos, Corne:Kirsten, Mari:le Grange, Susanna M:Loveland, Jerome:Machaea, Sello:Maharaj, Ashwini:Andrews, Nick:Madhi, Shabir A:Parashar, Umesh D:Journal Article:United States:Clin Infect Dis. 2019 May 24. pii: 5498228. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciz431.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125061","Medical Research Council: Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Department of Science and Technology/National Research Foundation: Vaccine Preventable Diseases, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA.:Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.:Tygerberg Hospital, University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town, South Africa.:East London Hospital Complex, Walter Sisulu University, East London, South Africa.:Steve Biko Academic Hospital/ Kalafong Hospital, University of Pretoria, South Africa.:Universitas Hospital, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.:Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital/Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital, University of Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban, South Africa.:Statistics, Modelling and Economics Department, Public Health England, London, United Kingdom.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/cid/ciz431"

Two frequently used incidence assays are the Sedia HIV-1 LAg-Avidity EIA (LAg) and the Bio-Rad avidity incidence (BRAI) assays with a mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) of 130 and 240 days for subtype B infections, respectively. Little is known about how these assays perform with recombinant HIV-1 strains. We evaluated the concordance of these assays in a population infected mainly with HIV-1 CRF06_cpx. MATERIAL/METHODS: Remnant serum samples (n = 288) collected from confirmed, newly-diagnosed HIV-positive persons from Estonia in 2013 were tested. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from clinical databases. LAg was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol and BRAI testing was done using a validated protocol. Samples with LAg-pending or BRAI-invalid results were reclassified as recent if they were from persons with viral loads <1000 copies/mL or were reclassified as long-term if presenting with AIDS. RESULTS: In total 325 new HIV infections were diagnosed in 2013 in Estonia. Of those 276 persons were tested with both LAg and BRAI. Using assay results only, the recency rate was 44% and 70% by LAg and BRAI, respectively. The majority of samples (92%) recent by LAg were recent by BRAI. Similarly, 89% of samples long-term by BRAI were long-term by LAg. After clinical information was included in the analysis, the recency rate was 44% and 62% for LAg and BRAI, respectively. The majority of samples (86%) recent by LAg were recent by BRAI and 91% of long-term infections by BRAI were long-term by LAg. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of LAg and BRAI results in this mostly CRF06_cpx-infected population showed good concordance for incidence classification. Our finding of a higher recency rate with BRAI in this population is likely related to the longer MDRI for this assay.","1932-6203:Huik, Kristi:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1569-8830:Soodla, Pilleriin:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1445-7653:Pauskar, Merit:Owen, S Michele:Luo, Wei:Murphy, Gary:Jogeda, Ene-Ly:Kallas, Eveli:Rajasaar, Heli:Avi, Radko:Masciotra, Silvina:Lutsar, Irja:CASCADE Collaboration in the EuroCoord:Journal Article:United States:PLoS One. 2019 May 24;14(5):e0217048. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217048. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31125356","Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.:Clinical Retrovirology Section, HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland, United States of America.:Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/HIV AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Virus Reference Department, Public Health England, London, United Kingdom.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0217048"

Serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a specific functional indicator of vitamin B-12 status; however, concentrations increase with impaired renal function. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of serum vitamin B-12 and MMA in US adults, and estimate age-specific reference intervals for serum MMA in a healthy subpopulation with replete vitamin B-12 status and normal renal function. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional data for serum vitamin B-12 and MMA in adults participating in the NHANES from 2011 to 2014. Vitamin B-12 was measured by electrochemiluminescence assay and MMA by isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, age, race/Hispanic origin, and vitamin B-12 supplement use were generally significantly associated with serum vitamin B-12 and MMA concentrations. Serum MMA concentrations increased with age, particularly in persons aged >/=70 y. Non-Hispanic white persons had lower vitamin B-12 and higher MMA concentrations than non-Hispanic black persons. Shorter fasting times and impaired renal function were significantly associated with higher serum MMA concentrations, but not with serum vitamin B-12 concentrations after controlling for covariates. The central 95% reference intervals for serum vitamin B-12 and MMA concentrations were widest for persons aged >/=70 y compared with younger age groups. Compared with the overall population, the central 95% reference intervals for serum MMA concentrations were considerably narrower for a vitamin B-12-replete subpopulation with normal renal function, but still age-dependent. Serum vitamin B-12 showed little, whereas serum MMA showed notable, increases with impaired renal function. CONCLUSIONS: The higher serum MMA concentrations throughout the entire distribution in older persons (especially persons aged >/=70 y) who are vitamin B-12-replete and have normal renal function indicate the need for age-specific MMA reference intervals to better interpret vitamin B-12 status in epidemiologic research.","1938-3207:Mineva, Ekaterina M:Sternberg, Maya R:Zhang, Mindy:Aoki, Yutaka:Storandt, Renee:Bailey, Regan L:Pfeiffer, Christine M:Journal Article:United States:Am J Clin Nutr. 2019 May 25. pii: 5498649. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/nqz045.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127807","National Center for Environmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, GA.:National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, Hyattsville, MD.:Department of Nutrition Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/ajcn/nqz045"

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled adult TB patients and their close contacts at nine United States and Canadian sites. TB patients and contacts were interviewed to identify potential index patient, contact, and exposure risk factors for TB. Contacts were evaluated for latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB, and the effectiveness of LTBI treatment for preventing contact TB was examined. RESULTS: Among 4490 close contacts, multivariable risk factors for TB were age < 5 years, US/Canadian birth, human immunodeficiency virus infection, skin test induration > 10 mm, shared bedroom with an index patient, exposure to more than one index patient, and index patient weight loss (P<.05 for each). Of 1406 skin test-positive contacts, TB developed in 49 (9.8%) of 446 who did not initiate treatment, 8 (1.8%) of 443 who received partial treatment, and 1 (0.2%) of 517 who completed treatment (1951, 290, and 31 cases/100,000 person years, respectively; P<.001).

Medicaid currently covers approximately 80 million low-income Americans, including a high percentage of racial and ethnic minorities. Studies have shown that racial and ethnic minority populations, particularly those with low SES, are at an increased risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease. Therefore, as Medicaid expands, there will likely be a greater demand for sexually transmitted disease services in community-based physician offices. To determine demand for these services among Medicaid enrollees, this study examined how often Medicaid was used to pay for sexually transmitted disease services received in this setting. METHODS: This study combined 2014 and 2015 data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and tested for differences in the proportion of visits with an expected payment source of Medicaid when sexually transmitted disease services were and were not provided. All analyses were conducted in October 2018. RESULTS: During 2014-2015, an estimated 25 million visits received a sexually transmitted disease service. Medicaid paid for a greater percentage of sexually transmitted disease visits (35.5%, 95% CI=22.5%, 51.1%) compared with non-sexually transmitted disease visits (12.1%, 95% CI=10.8%, 13.6%). Logistic regression modeling, controlling for age, sex, and race of the patient, showed that visits covered by Medicaid had increased odds of paying for a sexually transmitted disease service visit (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.12, 3.46), compared with other expected payment sources. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing sexually transmitted disease prevention in Medicaid populations could reduce sexually transmitted disease incidence and resulting morbidity and costs.","1873-2607:Pearson, William S:Spicknall, Ian H:Cramer, Ryan:Jenkins, Wiley D:Journal Article:Netherlands:Am J Prev Med. 2019 May 16. pii: S0749-3797(19)30123-0. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2019.02.019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128954","Division of STD Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

This study examines whether the Dating Matters comprehensive prevention model, compared with a standard of care intervention, prevented negative relationship behaviors and promoted positive relationship behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: This longitudinal, cluster-RCT compared the effectiveness of Dating Matters with standard of care across middle school. Standard of care was an evidence-based teen dating violence prevention curriculum (Safe Dates) implemented in eighth grade. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six middle schools in high-risk urban neighborhoods in four U.S. cities were randomized. Schools lost to follow-up were replaced with new schools, which were independently randomized (71% school retention). Students were surveyed in fall and spring of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades (2012-2016). The analysis sample includes students from schools implementing Dating Matters or standard of care for >2 years who started sixth grade in the fall of 2012 or 2013 and had dated (N=2,349 students, mean age 12 years, 49% female, and 55% black, non-Hispanic, 28% Hispanic, 17% other). INTERVENTION: Dating Matters is a comprehensive, multicomponent prevention model including classroom-delivered programs for sixth to eighth graders, training for parents of sixth to eighth graders, educator training, a youth communications program, and local health department activities to assess capacity and track teen dating violence-related policy and data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported teen dating violence perpetration and victimization, use of negative conflict resolution strategies, and positive relationship skills were examined as outcomes. Imputation and analyses were conducted in 2017. RESULTS: Latent panel models demonstrated significant program effects for three of four outcomes; Dating Matters students reported 8.43% lower teen dating violence perpetration, 9.78% lower teen dating violence victimization, and 5.52% lower use of negative conflict resolution strategies, on average across time points and cohorts, than standard of care students. There were no significant effects on positive relationship behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Dating Matters demonstrates comparative effectiveness, through middle school, for reducing unhealthy relationship behaviors, such as teen dating violence and use of negative conflict resolution strategies, relative to the standard of care intervention.

Studies in European populations to examine the association of PFAS exposure and comprehensive cardiometabolic traits and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are limited. METHODS: In this pilot cross-sectional study of a well-characterized adult population of the island of Hvar, situated off the eastern Adriatic coast of Croatia, we measured PFAS concentrations in plasma samples collected during 2007-2008 and examined their cross-sectional associations with cardiometabolic traits and MetS after adjustment of covariates (n=122). PFAS investigated in this study included perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). RESULTS: The geometric mean (range) was 8.91 (2.36, 33.67) ng/mL for PFOS, 2.87 (1.03, 8.02) ng/mL for PFOA, 0.77 (0.25, 2.40) ng/mL for PFHxS, and 1.29 (0.48, 3.46) ng/mL for PFNA, with frequency of detection at 100%, 100%, 95.9%, and 100%, respectively. PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA concentrations were positively associated with the risk of MetS as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria, with estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals at 1.89 (0.93, 3.86), 2.19 (0.88, 5.44), and 2.95 (1.12, 7.80), respectively, with only PFNA reaching statistical significance. PFNA concentrations were associated with increased risk of overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Background exposure to PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA was marginally associated with increased risk of MetS in this small study, and these results should be confirmed with a larger sample size and longitudinal follow-up.","1879-1026:Chen, Aimin:Jandarov, Roman:Zhou, Li:Calafat, Antonia M:Zhang, Ge:Urbina, Elaine M:Sarac, Jelena:Augustin, Dubravka Havas:Caric, Tonko:Bockor, Luka:Petranovic, Matea Zajc:Novokmet, Natalija:Missoni, Sasa:Rudan, Pavao:Deka, Ranjan:Journal Article:Netherlands:Sci Total Environ. 2019 May 20;683:29-36. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.250.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129329","Division of Epidemiology, Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

Two reviewers will independently abstract data on authors' names, study years, countries, population characteristics and design. To describe and summarise study topics, we will use 19 codes and five categories that were developed from a preliminary study. The five categories are category 1: potential PrEP user/prescriber (behaviours/issues for potential PrEP takers/healthcare professionals), category 2: considerations while on PrEP (experiences of and problems related to staying on or prescribing PrEP), category 3: PrEP efficacy and safety (biomedical aspects and medication efficacy), category 4: methods of and experiences with PrEP clinical trials (possesses/experiences of clinical trials) and category 5: cost-effectiveness or economic evaluation (cost studies). Data will be analysed with descriptive statistics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings will be presented at HIV-related conferences and published in peer-review journals.","2044-6055:Kamitani, Emiko:Johnson, Adebukola H:Wichser, Megan:Mizuno, Yuko:DeLuca, Julia B:Higa, Darrel H:Journal Article:England:BMJ Open. 2019 May 24;9(5):e024212. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024212.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129574","Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Prevention Research Centers, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.:ICF International Inc, Fairfax, Virginia, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024212"

An essential NITAG function is to ensure that these decisions are grounded in the best available evidence generated through a systematic, transparent process. However, in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), experience with this decision making method is limited. The Task Force for Global Health manages the Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction (PIVI) program in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ministries of Health, corporate partners and others. During 2017, PIVI worked with its country partners and the World Health Organization regional and local offices to assess NITAG strengthening needs and to provide technical assistance in 7 LMIC countries (Laos Peoples Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Vietnam, Armenia, Cote d'Ivoire; Moldova and the Republic of Georgia). Our workshops supported general NITAG capacity building and the evidence-based review process using vaccines of interest to the country. For NITAGs reviewing evidence on seasonal influenza, we developed an influenza resource package to support their review and provide country-relevant information in an easy to use format. Of the seven NITAGs trained, six have applied some of the concepts learnt: revision or development of formal transparent, systematic procedures for their operations; preparation of recommendations on seasonal influenza vaccination using quality-assessed data from systematic searches and local data; and have applied the principles learned for making other new vaccine recommendations. Our experience confirms that LMIC NITAGs are considerably under-resourced without adequate technical support or access to global peer-reviewed literature. Ongoing support from NITAG partners must be secured and creative approaches might be needed to help countries achieve the GVAP 2020 target and support development of sustainable vaccine policies and programs.","1873-2518:Ba-Nguz, Antoinette:Shah, Adeel:Bresee, Joseph S:Lafond, Kathryn E:Cavallaro, Kathy:Shefer, Abigail:Donadel, Morgane:Seward, Jane F:Journal Article:Netherlands:Vaccine. 2019 May 23. pii: S0264-410X(19)30670-X. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.05.046.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130258","Task Force for Global Health, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Task Force for Global Health, Atlanta, GA, USA; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA USA.

Methods: We surveyed children <10 years old at home weekly from August 2012-August 2014, for cough, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, ear discharge, and shortness of breath. Symptomatic children were assessed for ALRI using World Health Organization definitions. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained from all ALRI cases and asymptomatic controls and tested using polymerase chain reaction for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), and influenza viruses (IV). We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using logistic regression to calculate etiologic fractions (EF). We multiplied agent-specific ALRI incidence rates by EF to calculate the adjusted incidence as episodes per child-year. Results: ALRI incidence was 0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.20) episode per child-year. Association between virus and ALRI was strongest for RSV (aOR = 15.9; 95% CI = 7.3-34.7; EF = 94%) and least for IV (aOR = 4.6; 95% CI = 2.0-10.6; EF = 78%).

Results: Of the 1758 participants who completed the survey, 60.9% were male, 62.1% were 50-69 years old, and 95.5% white. Approximately, 72.0% reported initial limb weakness onset of disease, followed by bulbar (22.1%), and trunk/global onset (6.1%). Other symptoms ever experienced included cramps (56.7%), fasciculations (56.3%), and dysarthria (33.0%).

DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two community hospitals and 1 academic medical center. PATIENTS: Hospitalized patients who received >/=1 dose of a systemic antimicrobial agent. METHODS: We collected and reviewed electronic data on inpatient and discharge antimicrobial prescribing from April to September 2016 in 3 pilot hospitals. Inpatient antimicrobial use was obtained from electronic medication administration records. Postdischarge antimicrobial use was calculated from electronic discharge prescriptions. We completed a manual validation to evaluate the ability of electronic prescriptions to capture intended postdischarge antibiotics. Inpatient, postdischarge, and total lengths of therapy (LOT) per admission were calculated to assess durations of antimicrobial therapy attributed to hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 45,693 inpatient admissions were evaluated. Antimicrobials were given during 23,447 admissions (51%), and electronic discharge prescriptions were captured in 7,442 admissions (16%). Manual validation revealed incomplete data capture in scenarios in which prescribers avoided the electronic system. The postdischarge LOT among admissions with discharge antimicrobials was median 8 days (range, 1-360) with peaks at 5, 7, 10, and 14 days. Postdischarge days accounted for 38% of antimicrobial exposure days. CONCLUSION: Discharge antimicrobial therapy accounted for a large portion of antimicrobial exposure related to inpatient hospital stays. Discharge prescription data can feasibly be captured through electronic prescribing records and may aid in designing stewardship interventions at transitions of care.","1559-6834:Dyer, April P:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0360-8172:Dodds Ashley, Elizabeth:Anderson, Deverick J:Sarubbi, Christina:Wrenn, Rebekah:Hicks, Lauri A:Srinivasan, Arjun:Moehring, Rebekah W:Journal Article:United States:Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2019 May 28:1-8. doi: 10.1017/ice.2019.118.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134880","Duke Center for Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Prevention,Duke University School of Medicine,Durham, North Carolina.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1017/ice.2019.118"

There is strong scientific evidence that regulating alcohol outlet density is an effective intervention for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms, but there is no standard method for measuring this exposure. PROGRAM: We overview the strategies available for measuring outlet density, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and provide examples of how they can be applied in practice. IMPLEMENTATION: The 3 main approaches for measuring density are container-based (eg, number of outlets in a county), distance-based (eg, average distance between a college and outlets), and spatial access-based (eg, weighted distance between town center and outlets). EVALUATION: While container-based measures are the simplest to calculate and most intuitive, distance-based or spatial access-based measures are unconstrained by geopolitical boundaries and allow for assessment of clustering (an amplifier of certain alcohol-related harms). Spatial access-based measures can also be adjusted for population size/demographics but are the most resource-intensive to produce. DISCUSSION: Alcohol outlet density varies widely across and between locations and over time, which is why it is important to measure it. Routine public health surveillance of alcohol outlet density is important to identify problem areas and detect emerging ones. Distance- or spatial access-based measures of alcohol outlet density are more resource-intensive than container-based measures but provide a much more accurate assessment of exposure to alcohol outlets and can be used to assess clustering, which is particularly important when assessing the relationship between density and alcohol-related harms, such as violent crime.","1550-5022:Sacks, Jeffrey J:Brewer, Robert D:Mesnick, Jessica:Holt, James B:Zhang, Xingyou:Kanny, Dafna:Elder, Randy:Gruenewald, Paul J:Journal Article:United States:J Public Health Manag Pract. 2019 May 20. doi: 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001023.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136416","Sue Binder Consulting, Inc, Decatur, Georgia (Dr Sacks); Alcohol Program (Drs Brewer and Kanny and Ms Mesnick) and Analytic Methods Team (Dr Holt), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, and Office of Science Quality, Office of the Associate Director for Science (Dr Elder), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture, Washington, District of Columbia (Dr Zhang); and Prevention Research Center, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, Berkeley, California (Dr Gruenewald).",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/phh.0000000000001023"

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare sodium and potassium intake derived from 24-h dietary recall (24HDR) with intake derived from 24-h urinary excretion (24HUE). DESIGN: Data were analyzed from 776 nonpregnant, noninstitutionalized US adults aged 20-69 y who completed 1-to-2 24HUE and 24HDR measures in the 2014 NHANES. A total of 1190 urine specimens and 1414 dietary recalls were analyzed. Mean bias was estimated as mean of the differences between individual mean 24HDR and 24HUE measurements. Correlations and attenuation factors were estimated using the Kipnis joint-mixed effects model accounting for within-person day-to-day variability in sodium excretion. The attenuation factor reflects the degree to which true associations between long-term intake (estimated using 24HUEs) and a hypothetical health outcome would be approximated using a single 24HDR: values near 1 indicate close approximation and near 0 indicate bias toward null. Estimates are reported for sodium, potassium, and the sodium: potassium (Na/K) ratio. Model parameters can be used to estimate correlations/attenuation factors when multiple 24HDRs are available. RESULTS: Overall, mean bias for sodium was -452 mg (95% CI: -646, -259), for potassium -315 mg (CI: -450, -179), and for the Na/K ratio -0.04 (CI: -0.15, 0.07, NS). Using 1 24HDR, the attenuation factor for sodium was 0.16 (CI: 0.09, 0.21), for potassium 0.25 (CI:0.16, 0.36), and for the Na/K ratio 0.20 (CI: 0.10, 0.25). The correlation for sodium was 0.27 (CI: 0.16, 0.37), for potassium 0.35 (CI: 0.26, 0.55), and for the Na/K ratio 0.27 (CI: 0.13, 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 24HUE, using 24HDR underestimates mean sodium and potassium intake but is unbiased for the Na/K ratio. Additionally, using 24HDR as a measure of exposure in observational studies attenuates the true associations of sodium and potassium intake with health outcomes.","1938-3207:Va, Puthiery:Dodd, Kevin W:Zhao, Lixia:Thompson-Paul, Angela M:Mercado, Carla I:Terry, Ana L:Jackson, Sandra L:Wang, Chia-Yih:Loria, Catherine M:Moshfegh, Alanna J:Rhodes, Donna G:Cogswell, Mary E:Journal Article:United States:Am J Clin Nutr. 2019 Jun 1;109(6):1672-1682. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/nqz044.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136657","Epidemic Intelligence Service.:Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention.:National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.:IHRC, Inc., Atlanta, GA.:Division of Diabetes Translation.:National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.:United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/ajcn/nqz044"

This study characterized HPV vaccine attitudes among male and female adolescents, identified factors associated with attitude changes, and examined associations between attitudes and vaccination receipt. Surveys were administered to adolescents aged 15-16 years who had not completed the HPV vaccine series. A modified version of the Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (CHIAS) was employed to assess barriers, harms, ineffectiveness, and uncertainties scores. Surveys were available from 108 participants; 63% were male and 33% had initiated the HPV vaccine series at baseline. CHIAS scores significantly decreased (i.e., became more favorable) between baseline and follow up for barriers (p=0.01) and uncertainties (p<0.01). At least one sociodemographic/clinical factor was associated with changes in each score. Attitude changes were not associated with receipt of HPV vaccine, although adolescents with higher baseline harms scores were significantly less likely to receive an HPV vaccine dose (OR=0.67). Adolescents' HPV vaccine attitudes slightly improved over a one year period during which an intervention was implemented. More research is needed to learn how parent and adolescent HPV vaccine attitudes form, and how best to address concerns about vaccine harms.","2405-8521:Hanson, Kayla E:McLean, Huong Q:Belongia, Edward A:Stokley, Shannon:McNeil, Michael M:Gee, Julianne:VanWormer, Jeffrey J:Journal Article:Netherlands:Papillomavirus Res. 2019 May 25. pii: S2405-8521(18)30150-2. doi: 10.1016/j.pvr.2019.05.001.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136831","Center for Clinical Epidemiology & Population Health, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, 1000 North Oak Avenue, ML2, Marshfield, WI, 54449, USA.:Center for Clinical Epidemiology & Population Health, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, 1000 North Oak Avenue, ML2, Marshfield, WI, 54449, USA.

Here, we show that two lineages, 2.MED and 1.ORI3, spread significantly faster than others, possibly reflecting differences among strains in transmission mechanisms and virulence. Plague spread fastest in regions with low population density and high proportion of pasture- or forestland, findings that should be taken into account for effective plague monitoring and control. Temperature exhibited a nonlinear, U-shaped association with spread speed, with a minimum around 20 degrees C, while precipitation showed a positive association.

Design: We conducted a literature review focusing on PEPFAR's contribution to the HIV response in Ghana. Additionally, we summarized the epidemiology of HIV. We searched both peer-reviewed and grey literature. Setting: Ghana. Results: Overall, HIV prevalence in Ghana is 1.6% with regional variation. Key populations (KPs) are disproportionately affected by HIV in the country. FSW and their clients, and MSM, account for 28% of all new infections. PEPFAR provides technical assistance (TA) to Ghana to maximize the quality, coverage and impact of the national HIV/AIDS response. To ensure adequate supply of antiretrovirals (ARVs), in 2016-2017, PEPFAR invested $23.7 million as a onetime supplemental funding to support Ghana's ARV treatment program. In addition, the National AIDS Control Programme in collaboration with PEPFAR is implementing a scale up of viral load testing. PEPFAR is also implementing a comprehensive package of prevention services in five regions to help reach MSM and FSW and to expand HIV testing services for KPs. Conclusions: Ghana is making changes at both policy and program level in the fight against HIV/AIDS and is working towards achieving the UNAIDS' 90-90-90 targets. PEPFAR is providing TA to ensure these goals can be achieved.

We sequenced MBL2 ""low-producer"" variants rs11003125(""H/L""), rs7096206(""Y/X""), rs1800450Gly54Asp(""B""), rs1800451Gly57Glu(""C""), rs5030737Arg52Cys(""D"") in patients and biologic parents. We measured serum levels and compared complement activity in low-producing homozygotes (""B/B,"" ""C/C"") to HYA/HYA controls. We used a population control of 1,142 healthy children and also analyzed family trios (PBAT/HBAT) to evaluate disease susceptibility, and nested case-control analyses to evaluate severity. Results: We genotyped 420 patients with confirmed influenza-related sepsis: 159 (38%) had acute lung injury (ALI), 165 (39%) septic shock, and 30 (7%) died. Although bacterial co-infection was diagnosed in 133 patients (32%), only MRSA co-infection (n = 33, 8% overall) was associated with death (p < 0.0001), present in 11 of 30 children that died (37%). MBL2 variants predicted serum levels and complement activation as expected. We found no association between influenza-related critical illness susceptibility and MBL2 variants using family trios (633 biologic parents) or compared to population controls. MBL2 variants were not associated with admission illness severity, septic shock, ALI, or bacterial co-infection diagnosis. Carriage of low-MBL producing MBL2 variants was not a risk factor for mortality, but children that died did have higher carriage of one or more B alleles (OR 2.3; p = 0.007), including 7 of 11 with influenza MRSA-related death (vs. 2 of 22 survivors: OR 14.5, p = 0.0002). Conclusions: MBL2 variants that decrease MBL levels were not associated with susceptibility to pediatric influenza-related critical illness or with multiple measures of critical illness severity.

How can technology help to overcome challenges in infection prevention and control (IPC) and to prevent HAI and emerging AMR? Methods: In June 2017, 42 international experts convened in Geneva, Switzerland to discuss four potential domains of technology in IPC and AMR: 1) role and potential contribution of microbiome research; 2) whole genome sequencing; 3) effectiveness and benefit of antimicrobial environmental surfaces; and 4) future research in hand hygiene. Results: Research on the microbiome could expand understanding of antimicrobial use and also the role of probiotics or even faecal transplantation for therapeutic purposes. Whole genome sequencing will provide new insights in modes of transmission of infectious diseases. Although it is a powerful tool for public health epidemiology, some challenges with interpretation and costs still need to be addressed. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobially coated or treated environmental high-touch surfaces requires further research before they can be recommended for routine use. Hand hygiene implementation can be advanced, where technological enhancement of surveillance, technique and compliance are coupled with reminders for healthcare professionals. Conclusions: The four domains of technological innovation contribute to the prevention of HAI and AMR at different levels. Microbiome research may offer innovative concepts for future prevention, whole genome sequencing could detect new modes of transmission and become an additional tool for effective public health epidemiology, antimicrobial surfaces might help to decrease the environment as source of transmission but continue to raise more questions than answers, and technological innovation may have a role in improving surveillance approaches and supporting best practice in hand hygiene.","2047-2994:Zingg, Walter:Park, Benjamin J:Storr, Julie:Ahmad, Raheelah:Tarrant, Carolyn:Castro-Sanchez, Enrique:Perencevich, Eli:Widmer, Andreas:Krause, Karl-Heinz:Kilpatrick, Claire:Tomczyk, Sara:Allegranzi, Benedetta:Cardo, Denise:Pittet, Didier:2017 Geneva IPC-Think Tank:Journal Article:England:Antimicrob Resist Infect Control. 2019 May 22;8:83. doi: 10.1186/s13756-019-0538-y. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139366","Infection control programme and WHO collaborating center, University of Geneva Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, 4 Rue Gabrielle Perret-Gentil, 1211, Geneva 14, Switzerland.:2US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA USA.0000 0001 2163 0069grid.416738.f:3Infection Prevention and Control Global Unit, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.0000000121633745grid.3575.4:4National Institute for Health Research in Healthcare Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, Imperial College London, London, UK.0000 0001 2113 8111grid.7445.2:5Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.0000 0004 1936 8411grid.9918.9:6Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.0000 0004 1936 8294grid.214572.7:7Infection Control Programme, University Hospitals of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1:8Institute of Genetics and Genomics, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.0000 0001 2322 4988grid.8591.5",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s13756-019-0538-y"

Many patients with ME/CFS do not receive appropriate healthcare, partially due to lack of diagnostic tests, and knowledge/attitudes/beliefs about ME/CFS. This study was to assess the utility of US ambulatory healthcare data in profiling demographics, co-morbidities, and healthcare in ME/CFS. Methods: Data came from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) in the U.S. Weighted analysis was performed. We examined 9.06 billion adult visits from 2000 to 2009 NAMCS/NHAMCS data. ME/CFS-related visits were identified by ICD-9-CM code, 780.71, up to tertiary diagnosis. Results: We estimated 2.9 million (95% CI: 1.8-3.9 million) ME/CFS-related visits during 2000-2009, with no statistical evidence (p-trend = 0.31) for a decline or increase in ME/CFS-related visits. Internists, general and family practitioners combined provided 52.12% of these visits. Patients with ME/CFS-related visits were mostly in their 40 and 50 s (47.76%), female (66.07%), white (86.95%), metropolitan/urban residents (92.05%), and insured (87.26%). About 71% of ME/CFS patients had co-morbidities, including depression (35.79%), hypertension (31.14%), diabetes (20.30%), and arthritis (14.11%). As one quality indicator, physicians spent more time on ME/CFS-related visits than non-ME/CFS visits (23.62 vs. 19.38 min, p = 0.065). As additional quality indicators, the top three preventive counseling services provided to patients with ME/CFS-related visits were diet/nutrition (8.33%), exercise (8.21%), and smoking cessation (7.24%). Compared to non-ME/CFS visits, fewer ME/CFS-related visits included counseling for stress management (0.75 vs. 3.14%, p = 0.010), weight reduction (0.88 vs. 4.02%, p = 0.002), injury prevention (0.04 vs. 1.64%, p < 0.001), and family planning/contraception (0.17 vs. 1.45%, p = 0.037). Conclusions: Visits coded with ME/CFS did not increase from 2000 to 2009. Almost three quarters of ME/CFS-related visits were made by ME/CFS patients with other co-morbid conditions, further adding to complexity in ME/CFS healthcare. While physicians spent more time with ME/CFS patients, a lower proportion of ME/CFS patients received preventive counseling for weight reduction, stress management, and injury prevention than other patients despite the complexity of ME/CFS. NAMCS/NHAMCS data are useful in evaluating co-morbidities, healthcare utilization, and quality indicators for healthcare in ME/CFS.","Bae, Jaeyong:Lin, Jin-Mann S:Journal Article:Switzerland:Front Pediatr. 2019 May 14;7:185. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00185. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139604","Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.:Department of Health Policy and Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.3389/fped.2019.00185"

METHODS: Performance of 206 ICD-10-CM code assignments indicative of bleeding, five anticoagulant adverse effect/poisoning codes, and five coagulopathy codes (according to Medicare Parts A and B claims) as assessed among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries prescribed anticoagulants between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016 (according to Part D claims). Structured medical record review was the gold standard for validating the presence of anticoagulant-related bleeding. Sensitivity was adjusted to correct for partial verification bias due to sampling design. RESULTS: Based on the study sample of 1166 records (583 cases, 583 controls), 57 of 206 codes yielded the optimal performance for anticoagulant-related bleeding (diagnostic odds ratio, 51; positive predictive value (PPV), 75.7% [95% CI, 72.0%-79.1%]; adjusted sensitivity, 70.0% [95% CI, 63.2%-77.7%]). Codes for intracranial bleeding demonstrated the highest PPV (85.0%) and adjusted sensitivity (91.0%). Bleeding codes in the primary position demonstrated high PPV (86.9%), but low adjusted sensitivity (36.0%). The adjusted sensitivity improved to 69.5% when codes in a secondary position were added. Only one adverse effect/poisoning code was used, appearing in 7.8% of cases and controls (PPV, 71.4% and adjusted sensitivity, 6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Performance of ICD-10-CM code assignments for bleeding among patients prescribed anticoagulants varied by bleed type and code position. Adverse effect/poisoning codes were not commonly used and would have missed over 90% of anticoagulant-related bleeding cases.","1099-1557:Shehab, Nadine:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8700-8539:Ziemba, Robert:Campbell, Kyle N:Geller, Andrew I:Moro, Ruth N:Gage, Brian F:Budnitz, Daniel S:Yang, Tsu-Hsuan:200-2016-91960/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Broad Agency Announcement 2016-N-17812:Journal Article:England:Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2019 May 29. doi: 10.1002/pds.4783.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31144403","Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Pharmacy and Quality Measurement Division, Health Services Advisory Group, Inc., Tampa, Florida.:Northrop Grumman Corporation, contractor to the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1002/pds.4783"

Mold exposure was a serious concern because investigations after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2005) had documented extensive mold growth in flood-damaged homes (2,3). Because mold exposure can cause serious illnesses known as invasive mold infections (4,5), and immunosuppressed persons are at high risk for these infections (6,7), several federal agencies recommend that immunosuppressed persons avoid mold-contaminated sites (8,9). To assess the extent of exposure to mold and flood-damaged areas among persons at high risk for invasive mold infections after Hurricane Harvey, CDC and Texas health officials conducted a survey among 103 immunosuppressed residents in Houston. Approximately half of the participants (50) engaged in cleanup of mold and water-damaged areas; these activities included heavy cleanup (23), such as removing furniture or removing drywall, or light cleanup (27), such as wiping down walls or retrieving personal items. Among immunosuppressed persons who performed heavy cleanup, 43% reported wearing a respirator, as did 8% who performed light cleanup. One participant reported wearing all personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for otherwise healthy persons (i.e., respirator, boots, goggles, and gloves). Immunosuppressed residents who are at high risk for invasive mold infections were exposed to mold and flood-damaged areas after Hurricane Harvey; recommendations from health care providers to avoid exposure to mold and flood-damaged areas could mitigate the risk to immunosuppressed persons.","1545-861x:Chow, Nancy A:Toda, Mitsuru:Pennington, Audrey F:Anassi, Enock:Atmar, Robert L:Cox-Ganser, Jean M:Da Silva, Juliana:Garcia, Bobbiejean:Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P:Ostrosky-Zeichner, Luis:Leining, Lauren M:McCarty, Jennifer:Al Mohajer, Mayar:Murthy, Bhavini Patel:Park, Ju-Hyeong:Schulte, Joann:Shuford, Jennifer A:Skrobarcek, Kimberly A:Solomon, Samantha:Strysko, Jonathan:Chiller, Tom M:Jackson, Brendan R:Chew, Ginger L:Beer, Karlyn D:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 May 31;68(21):469-473. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6821a1.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145717",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6821a1"

Among persons with HIV infection, approximately 75% were aware of their HIV status, leaving 9.4 million persons with undiagnosed infection (1). Index testing, also known as partner notification or contact tracing, is an effective case-finding strategy that targets the exposed contacts of HIV-positive persons for HIV testing services.

During this 18-month period, 1,700,998 HIV tests with 99,201 (5.8%) positive results were reported using index testing. The positivity rate for index testing was 9.8% among persons aged >/=15 years and 1.5% among persons aged <15 years.

Babesiosis can be life threatening, particularly for persons who are asplenic, immunocompromised, or elderly. PERIOD COVERED: 2011-2015. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: CDC has conducted surveillance for babesiosis in the United States since January 2011, when babesiosis became a nationally notifiable condition. Health departments in states in which babesiosis is reportable voluntarily notify CDC of cases through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and submit supplemental case information by using a babesiosis-specific case report form (CRF). As of 2015, babesiosis was a reportable condition in 33 states compared with 22 states in 2011. RESULTS: For the 2011-2015 surveillance period, CDC was notified of 7,612 cases of babesiosis (6,277 confirmed [82.5%] and 1,335 probable [17.5%]). Case counts varied from year to year (1,126 cases for 2011, 909 for 2012, 1,761 for 2013, 1,742 for 2014, and 2,074 for 2015). Cases were reported among residents of 27 states. However, 7,194 cases (94.5%) occurred among residents of seven states with well-documented foci of tickborne transmission (i.e., Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin). Maine (152 cases) and New Hampshire (149 cases) were the only other states that reported >100 cases for the 5-year period, and both states also reported increasing numbers of cases over time. The median age of the 7,173 patients with available information was 63 years (range: <1-99 years; interquartile range: 51-73 years); 4,156 (57.9%) were aged >/=60 years, and 15 (<1%) were aged <1 year. The proportion of patients with symptom onset during June-August was >70% for each of the 5 surveillance years. Approximately half (3,004 of 6,404 [46.9%]) of the patients with available data were hospitalized at least overnight. Hospitalization rates ranged from 16.0% among patients aged 10-19 years (16 of 100) to 72.6% among those aged >/=80 years (552 of 760). Hospitalizations were reported significantly more often among patients who were asplenic than among patients who were not (106 of 126 [84.1%] versus 643 of 1,396 [46.1%]). Fifty-one cases of babesiosis among recipients of blood transfusions were classified by the reporting health department as transfusion associated. The median intervals from the earliest date associated with each case of babesiosis to the initial report via NNDSS and submission of supplemental CRF data to CDC were approximately 3 months and 1 year, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For the first 5 years of babesiosis surveillance, the reported cases occurred most frequently during June-August in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Maine and New Hampshire reported increasing numbers of cases over time, which suggests that foci of transmission might be expanding. Hospitalizations were common, particularly among patients who were asplenic or elderly. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Persons who live in or travel to regions where babesiosis is endemic should avoid tick-infested areas, apply repellent to skin and clothing, conduct full-body inspections for ticks after being outdoors, and remove attached ticks with fine-tipped tweezers as soon as possible. Prevention measures are especially important for persons at risk for severe babesiosis. Increases in the number and geographic range of reported cases warrant investigation to identify contributory factors (e.g., changes in tick density or in testing or surveillance methods). Complete and timely submission of risk factor data could facilitate assessments of the geographic ranges and transmission routes of Babesia parasites. Efforts to allow for electronic submission of CRF data are under way at CDC; electronic submission is expected to improve the timeliness, uniformity, and completeness of the data.","1545-8636:Gray, Elizabeth B:Herwaldt, Barbara L:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Surveill Summ. 2019 May 31;68(6):1-11. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.ss6806a1.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145719","Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Center for Global Health, CDC.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.ss6806a1"

In 2015, Blued, a Beijing-based media company that operates an online dating application popular among Chinese MSM, launched an ongoing HIV testing campaign that combined its push-notification(dagger) platform and geolocation capabilities to encourage HIV testing among MSM in Beijing. To assess trends in use of HIV testing services, Blued and CDC's China HIV program examined testing at six Blued-operated Beijing HIV testing centers from 2 years before the campaign launch in 2015 through December 31, 2017. A sharp increase in HIV testing followed the launch of Blued's online campaign, indicating that leveraging social media platforms and their geolocation-based text messaging functionality might be useful in increasing HIV testing among MSM, particularly those aged </=35 years.","1545-861x:Wang, Liming:Podson, Dylan:Chen, Zihuang:Lu, Hongyan:Wang, Vania:Shepard, Colin:Williams, John K:Mi, Guodong:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 May 31;68(21):478-482. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6821a3.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145721",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6821a3"

Clusters vary in size and scope, are associated with a diverse range of aerosol-producing devices, including exposures such as whirlpool spas and hotel water systems typically associated with travel, and can occur without an easily identified exposure source. Recently, jurisdictions have begun to use SaTScan spatio-temporal analysis software prospectively as part of routine cluster surveillance. We used data collected by the Active Bacterial Core surveillance platform to assess the ability of SaTScan to detect Legionnaires' disease clusters. We found that SaTScan analysis using traditional surveillance data and geocoded residential addresses was unable to detect many common Legionnaires' disease cluster types, such as those associated with travel or a prolonged time between cases. Additionally, signals from an analysis designed to simulate a real-time search for clusters did not align with clusters identified by traditional surveillance methods or a retrospective SaTScan analysis. A geospatial analysis platform better tailored to the unique characteristics of Legionnaires' disease epidemiology would improve cluster detection and decrease time to public health action.","1932-6203:Edens, Chris:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7563-6201:Alden, Nisha B:Danila, Richard N:Fill, Mary-Margaret A:Gacek, Paul:Muse, Alison:Parker, Erin:Poissant, Tasha:Ryan, Patricia A:Smelser, Chad:Tobin-D'Angelo, Melissa:Schrag, Stephanie J:Journal Article:United States:PLoS One. 2019 May 30;14(5):e0217632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217632. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145765","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Denver, Colorado, United States of America.:Minnesota Department of Health, St. Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.:Tennessee Department of Health, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.:Connecticut Department of Public Health, Hartford, Connecticut, United States of America.:New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York, United States of America.:California Emerging Infections Program, Oakland, California, United States of America.:Oregon Health Authority, Portland, Oregon, United States of America.:Maryland Department of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.:New Mexico Department of Health, Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States of America.:Georgia Department of Public Health, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0217632"

Bats are also known reservoirs for an assortment of zoonotic diseases, including rabies, for which they are commonly tested if identified as sick, behaving abnormally, or in instances where there has been a significant human exposure. In these cases, proper identification of bat species is important to public health experts as it will inform future testing procedures and management practices, as well as broaden our understanding of rabies virus bat variant distributions and disease ecology. Despite the multiple disciplines interested in bats, no key has been developed which includes all species found within the United States. For this reason, a dichotomous key and bat identification guide, designed to differentiate bats to species level, has been developed.

US national vaccine stockpiles are a cornerstone of the influenza pandemic preparedness plans. However, continual genetic and antigenic divergence of A(H5Nx) viruses requires the development of effective vaccination strategies using stockpiled vaccines and adjuvants for pandemic preparedness. Human sera collected from healthy adults who received either homologous (2 doses of a AS03A-adjuvanted A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005, A/Turkey), or heterologous (primed with AS03A-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/5/2005, A/Indo, followed by A/Turkey boost) prime-boost vaccination regimens were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays against 8 wild-type HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses from 6 genetic clades. Molecular, structural and antigenic features of the A(H5Nx) viruses that could influence the cross-clade antibody responses were also explored. Compared with homologous prime-boost vaccinations, priming with a clade 2.1.3.2 antigen (A/Indo) followed by one booster dose of a clade 2.2.1 antigen (A/Turkey) administered 18 months apart did not compromise the antibody responses to the booster vaccine (A/Turkey), it also broadened the cross-clade antibody responses to several antigenically drifted variants from 6 heterologous clades, including an antigenically distant A(H5N8) virus (A/gyrfalcon/Washington/410886/2014, clade 2.3.4.4) that caused recent outbreaks in US poultry. The magnitude and breadth of the cross-clade antibody responses against emerging HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses are associated with genetic, structural and antigenic differences from the vaccine viruses and enhanced by the inclusion of an adjuvant. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination with AS03A adjuvanted vaccine offers a vaccination strategy to use existing stockpiled vaccines for pandemic preparedness against new emerging HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses.","2059-0105:Levine, Min Z:Orcid: 0000-0002-3197-1649:Holiday, Crystal:Jefferson, Stacie:Gross, F Liaini:Liu, Feng:Li, Sheng:Friel, Damien:Boutet, Philippe:Innis, Bruce L:Mallett, Corey P:Tumpey, Terrence M:Stevens, James:Katz, Jacqueline M:Journal Article:England:NPJ Vaccines. 2019 May 29;4:22. doi: 10.1038/s41541-019-0114-8. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149353","1Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA USA.0000 0001 2163 0069grid.416738.f:2Battelle Memorial Institute, Atlanta, GA USA.0000000095689541grid.27873.39:5Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Washington, DC USA.grid.476870.a:Present Address: Sciogen, Los Altos, CA USA.:3GSK Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium.grid.425090.a:GSK Vaccines, Rockville, MD USA.:7Present Address: PATH, Washington, DC USA.0000 0004 0423 0663grid.416809.2",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1038/s41541-019-0114-8"

We examined the association between adiponectin concentration and HIV-associated lipodystrophy, which remains unclear. METHODS: The Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN) was a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected adults conducted in four US cities. Lean body and fat masses were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. Using baseline data from 2004 to 2006, we defined lipodystrophy using a sex-specific fat mass ratio and performed cross-sectional analyses of associated risks using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 440 male participants (median age 42 years; 68% non-Hispanic white; 88% prescribed combination antiretroviral therapy; median CD4 lymphocyte count 468 cells/muL; 76% with viral load < 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL; 5% diabetic; median body mass index 25 kg/m(2) ), median concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were 3.04 ng/L [interquartile range (IQR) 1.77-5.43 ng/L] and 8005 mug/mL (IQR 4950-11 935 mug/mL), respectively. The prevalence of lipodystrophy was 14%. Lipodystrophy was significantly associated with increasing age [prevalence ratio (PR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-2.06, per 10 years], adiponectin < 8005 mug/mL (PR 5.02; 95% CI 2.53-9.95), ever stavudine use (PR 2.26; 95% CI 1.36-3.75), CD4 cell count > 500 cells/muL (PR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61), viral load < 400 copies/mL (PR 3.98; 95% CI 1.25-12.6), highly sensitive C-reactive protein < 1.61 mg/L (PR 1.91; 95% CI 1.11-3.28) and smoking (PR 0.42; 95% CI 0.22-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Among men in this HIV-infected cohort, the prevalence of lipodystrophy was similar to previous estimates for persons living with HIV, and was associated with lower adiponectin levels, potentially indicating increased cardiovascular disease risk.","1468-1293:Klos, B:Patel, P:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1386-8194:Rose, C:Bush, T:Conley, L:Kojic, E M:Henry, K:Brooks, J T:Hammer, J:SUN study investigators:200-2002-00610/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2002-00611/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2002-00612/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2002-00613/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2007-23633/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2007-23634/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2007-23635/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2007-23636/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:Journal Article:England:HIV Med. 2019 May 31. doi: 10.1111/hiv.12754.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149766","Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.:Hennepin County Medical Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.:Denver Infectious Disease Consultants, Denver, CO, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1111/hiv.12754"

Previous American Thoracic Society documents have assessed the contribution of workplace exposures to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on a population level, but not to other chronic respiratory diseases. The goal of this document is to report an in-depth literature review and data synthesis of the occupational contribution to the burden of the major nonmalignant respiratory diseases, including airway diseases; interstitial fibrosis; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; other noninfectious granulomatous lung diseases, including sarcoidosis; and selected respiratory infections. Methods: Relevant literature was identified for each respiratory condition. The occupational population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated for those conditions for which there were sufficient population-based studies to allow pooled estimates. For the other conditions, the occupational burden of disease was estimated on the basis of attribution in case series, incidence rate ratios, or attributable fraction within an exposed group. Results: Workplace exposures contribute substantially to the burden of multiple chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma (PAF, 16%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PAF, 14%); chronic bronchitis (PAF, 13%); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PAF, 26%); hypersensitivity pneumonitis (occupational burden, 19%); other granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis (occupational burden, 30%); pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (occupational burden, 29%); tuberculosis (occupational burden, 2.3% in silica-exposed workers and 1% in healthcare workers); and community-acquired pneumonia in working-age adults (PAF, 10%). Conclusions: Workplace exposures contribute to the burden of disease across a range of nonmalignant lung conditions in adults (in addition to the 100% burden for the classic occupational pneumoconioses). This burden has important clinical, research, and policy implications. There is a pressing need to improve clinical recognition and public health awareness of the contribution of occupational factors across a range of nonmalignant respiratory diseases.","1535-4970:Blanc, Paul D:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9043-175X:Annesi-Maesano, Isabella:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6340-9300:Balmes, John R:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2246-7002:Cummings, Kristin J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5422-9199:Fishwick, David:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5941-090X:Miedinger, David:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4846-7828:Murgia, Nicola:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8180-1018:Naidoo, Rajen N:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2318-4004:Reynolds, Carl J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7415-258X:Sigsgaard, Torben:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2043-7571:Toren, Kjell:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8509-7603:Vinnikov, Denis:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0991-6237:Redlich, Carrie A:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6486-6725:Journal Article:United States:Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2019 Jun 1;199(11):1312-1334. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201904-0717ST.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149852",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1164/rccm.201904-0717ST"

Many regions have insufficient prevention intervention coverage. Using modelling, we investigate the impact of scaling-up prevention and treatment interventions on HCV transmission among PWID in Perry County, Kentucky (PC), and San Francisco, California (SF), where HCV sero-prevalence among PWID is >50%. A greater proportion of PWID access medication-assisted treatment (MAT) or syringe service programs (SSP) in urban SF (established community) than rural PC (young, expanding community). We model the proportion of HCV-infected PWID needing HCV-treatment annually to reduce HCV-incidence by 90% by 2030, with and without MAT scale-up (50% coverage, both settings) and SSP scale-up (PC only) from 2017. With current MAT&SSP coverage during 2017-2030, HCV-incidence will increase in PC (21.3 to 22.6 per 100 person-years (/100pyrs)) and decrease in SF (12.9 to 11.9/100pyrs). With concurrent MAT&SSP scale-up, 5%/year of HCV-infected PWID need HCV-treatment in PC to achieve incidence targets; 13%/year without MAT&SSP scale-up. In SF, a similar proportion need HCV-treatment (10%/year) irrespective of MAT scale-up. Reaching the same impact by 2025 requires increases in treatment rates of 45-82%.

The Health Care Provider Performance Review (HCPPR) is a comprehensive systematic review of the effectiveness and cost of strategies to improve HCP performance in LMICs. We present the HCPPR's methods, describe methodological and contextual attributes of included studies, and examine time trends of study attributes. METHODS: The HCPPR includes studies from LMICs that quantitatively evaluated any strategy to improve HCP performance for any health condition, with no language restrictions. Eligible study designs were controlled trials and interrupted time series. In 2006, we searched 15 databases for published studies; in 2008 and 2010, we completed searches of 30 document inventories for unpublished studies. Data from eligible reports were double-abstracted and entered into a database, which is publicly available. The primary outcome measure was the strategy's effect size. We assessed time trends with logistic, Poisson, and negative binomial regression modeling. We were unable to register with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) because the protocol was developed prior to the PROSPERO launch. RESULTS: We screened 105,299 citations and included 824 reports from 499 studies of 161 intervention strategies. Most strategies had multiple components and were tested by only one study each. Studies were from 79 countries and had diverse methodologies, geographic settings, HCP types, work environments, and health conditions. Training, supervision, and patient and community supports were the most commonly evaluated strategy components. Only 33.6% of studies had a low or moderate risk of bias. From 1958-2003, the number of studies per year and study quality increased significantly over time, as did the proportion of studies from low-income countries. Only 36.3% of studies reported information on strategy cost or cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have reported on the efficacy of many strategies to improve HCP performance in LMICs. However, most studies have important methodological limitations. The HCPPR is a publicly accessible resource for decision-makers, researchers, and others interested in improving HCP performance.","1932-6203:Rowe, Samantha Y:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3729-579X:Peters, David H:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8377-3444:Holloway, Kathleen A:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5032-6357:Chalker, John:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3282-9900:Ross-Degnan, Dennis:Rowe, Alexander K:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1383-4341:Journal Article:United States:PLoS One. 2019 May 31;14(5):e0217617. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217617. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150458","Malaria Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:CDC Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.:World Health Organization, Southeast Asia Regional Office, New Delhi, India.:International Institute of Health Management Research, Jaipur, India.:Pharmaceuticals & Health Technologies Group, Management Sciences for Health, Arlington, Virginia, United States of America.:Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.:Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0217617"

We examined baseline factors predicting falls at follow-up and estimated the impact of falls and balance/walking problems on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), mortality, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). About 23% reported falls and 34% reported balance/walking problems in the past 12months. The strongest predictors of falls were previous falls [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.9] and balance/walking problems (OR=1.7). Many self-reported chronic conditions (e.g., depression, stroke, and diabetes), geriatric symptoms (e.g., urine leakage), and limitations of activities of daily living (e.g., transferring and walking) also predicted falls, but at a smaller magnitude (ORs=1.1-1.3). Having balance/walking problems was associated with a greater decrease in HRQOL scores (0.195 points) than falls (0.077 points), while falls were associated with a greater increase in mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.5] than balance/walking problems (HR=1.1). Falls were associated with a 4.6-year (48%) decrease in QALYs, while balance/walking problems was associated with a 7.3-year (62%) decrease in QALYs. Falls are a major problem for U.S. elderly and will continue to have an even greater impact as the population ages. The nearly 50% decrease in QALYs for falls and >60% decrease for balance or walking problems demonstrates the substantial burden associated with these problems among older Americans.","1096-0260:Jia, Haomiao:Lubetkin, Erica I:DeMichele, Kimberly:Stark, Debra S:Zack, Matthew M:Thompson, William W:Journal Article:United States:Prev Med. 2019 May 28. pii: S0091-7435(19)30199-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.05.025.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150739","Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health and School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America.

Prevention research has focused mainly on collisions fatal to the drivers of large trucks. This analytical observational study addresses gaps in the literature by: conducting a descriptive analysis of motor vehicle claim events involving light-vehicle drivers in a large health care industry fleet; identifying risk factors for work-related MVCs and injuries based on vehicle miles traveled; and providing details on circumstances of these events. The study examined 8068 motor vehicle events resulting in vehicle damage, property damage, or injury reported by 6680 U.S.-based drivers in a light-vehicle sales and service fleet operated by a health care company over a 4 (1/2)-year period (January 2010 through June 2014). Thirty-three percent (n = 2660) of the events were collisions. Collisions were segmented as recoverable or non-recoverable according to whether the company could recover costs from another party, and mileage-based collision and injury rates were calculated by gender, age, tenure, and vehicle type. Differences in collision and injury rates between groups of interest (for example, tenure and age categories) were assessed with Poisson regression techniques adjusted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated observations on the same employee over time. Age, gender, and job tenure were significant collision risk factors, and risk patterns for recoverable and non-recoverable collisions were similar to those for total collisions. Collisions per million miles (CPMM) were significantly higher for drivers 21-24.9 years of age compared to drivers age 25-54.9 years (9.58 CPMM vs 4.96 CPMM, p = .025), drivers employed for less than 2 years compared to those employed 2 or more years (6.22 CPMM vs 4.82 CPMM, p < .001), for female drivers compared to male drivers (6.37 CPMM vs 4.16 CPMM, p < .001), and for drivers of passenger cars compared to all other vehicles (5.27 CPMM vs 4.48 CPMM, p < .001). Among collisions between the employee's vehicle and another vehicle in transport, those where the front of one vehicle hit another vehicle at an angle were the most likely to result in injury to the employee driver or another party (26%), followed by rear-end collisions (25%). Special attention should be given to preventing collisions among newly-hired employees, and to preventing angle and rear-end collisions, which were the most common types of collisions and also were most likely to result in injury than all other collisions combined.","1879-2057:Pratt, Stephanie G:Bell, Jennifer L:Journal Article:England:Accid Anal Prev. 2019 May 28;129:126-135. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2019.05.009.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31150919","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Safety Research, 1095 Willowdale Road, Mail Stop H-1808, Morgantown, WV, 26505, USA.

However, most previous studies were cross-sectional with the risk of reverse causation, suggesting a need for long-term prospective studies. We examined the relationship of baseline plasma PFAS concentrations with repeated measures of blood lipids. We included 888 prediabetic adults from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and DPP Outcomes Study, who had measurements of 6 plasma PFAS concentrations at baseline (1996-1999) and repeated measures of blood lipids over 15years of follow-up, and were initially randomized to placebo or a lifestyle intervention. We used linear regression to examine cross-sectional associations of PFAS concentrations and lipid levels at baseline, and evaluated prospective risks of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia using Cox proportional hazard models, and tested for effect modification by study arm. Participants (65.9% female, 57.0% White, 65.9% aged 40-59years) had comparable PFAS concentrations [e.g., median (IQR) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 4.9ng/mL (3.2)] with the general U.S. population in 1999-2000. We observed higher total cholesterol at baseline per doubling of PFOA (beta: 6.1mg/dL, 95% CI: 3.1, 9.04), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS, beta: 2.2mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.2, 4.3), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, beta: 2.9mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.7, 5.0). Prospectively, baseline concentrations of several PFASs, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA, predicted higher risks of incident hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, but only in the placebo group and not the lifestyle intervention group. For example, participants in the placebo group with PFOA concentration>median (4.9ng/mL) were almost twice as likely (HR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.88) to develop hypertriglyceridemia compared to those </=median.

Some studies suggest peripheral dysfunction while others suggest central auditory dysfunction. Human data are limited in this regard. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible chronic adverse effects of JP-8 combined with noise exposure on the peripheral and central auditory systems in humans. METHODS: Fifty-seven participants who were current personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were selected. Based on their levels of exposure to jet fuels, participants were divided into three exposure groups (low, moderate, high). Groups were also categorised based on their noise exposure levels (low, moderate, high). All participants were evaluated by tympanometry, pure-tone audiometry (1-12 kHz), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), words-in-noise, compressed speech, dichotic digit test, pitch pattern sequence test, duration pattern sequence test and adaptive test of temporal resolution. All auditory tests were carried out after the participants were away from the Air Force base for a minimum of two weeks, thus two weeks without jet fuel and noise exposure. RESULTS: Jet fuel exposure was significantly associated with hearing thresholds at 4 and 8 kHz; average hearing thresholds across frequencies in the better ear; DPOAEs at 2.8, 4 and 6 kHz; ABR wave V latency in the right ear; compressed speech and words-in-noise. Further analyses revealed that participants with low exposure level to jet fuels showed significantly better results for the aforementioned procedures than participants with moderate and high exposure levels. All results were controlled for the covariates of age and noise exposure levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that jet fuel exposure, when combined with noise exposure, has an adverse effect on audibility in humans. Taking all the test results into consideration, jet fuel exposure combined with noise exposure specifically seems to affect the peripheral hearing system in humans.","1471-2458:Fuente, Adrian:Hickson, Louise:Morata, Thais C:Williams, Warwick:Khan, Asaduzzaman:Fuentes-Lopez, Eduardo:APP1027549/National Health and Medical Research Council:Journal Article:England:BMC Public Health. 2019 May 31;19(1):675. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-7038-0.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151392","School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. adrian.fuente@umontreal.ca.:Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de geriatrie de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. adrian.fuente@umontreal.ca.:School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.:National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, OH, USA.:National Acoustic Laboratories, Sydney, NSW, Australia.:Carrera de Fonoaudiologia, Departamento de Ciencias de la Salud, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12889-019-7038-0"

We identified 176 people who had slept primarily in two lodges (Lodges A and B) at the research station, and successfully contacted 165 (93.8%) of these individuals. Risk assessments (RAs) were administered to all 165 individuals to determine degree and type of exposures to bats (e.g., biting or scratching). Exposure status for research station guests was classified as ""non-exposed,"" ""low risk"" or ""high risk,"" and counselling was provided to guide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendations. Prior to public health notification and intervention, 19 persons made the decision to pursue PEP. The healthcare-seeking behaviours of this group were taken to represent outcomes in the absence of public health intervention. (These persons received a RA, and their risk classification was retrospectively assigned.) Approximately 1-2 weeks after conducting the RAs, we conducted a follow-up survey to determine whether recommendations regarding PEP were ultimately followed. The proportion of individuals that unnecessarily pursued PEP was higher among the 19 individuals that sought health care prior to receiving the RA (p < 0.00001). Among those receiving the RA first, all persons classified as high risk followed public health guidance to seek PEP treatment. Despite this, upon re-interview, only 21/79 (26.6%) of guests could accurately recall their risk classification, with most people (55.7%) overestimating their risk. Study findings demonstrate that early public health interventions such as RAs can reduce unnecessary use of PEP and that messaging used during rabies counselling should be clear.","1863-2378:Cote, Andrea:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7750-4416:Wallace, Ryan M:Jackson, David A:Said, Maria A:Musgrave, Karl:Tran, Cuc H:Van Houten, Clayton:Harrist, Alexia:Buttke, Danielle:Busacker, Ashley:Pickens, Veronica:Guagliardo, Sarah Anne J:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4217-8195:Journal Article:Germany:Zoonoses Public Health. 2019 May 31. doi: 10.1111/zph.12585.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152500","Epidemic Intelligence Service, Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Wyoming Department of Health, Cheyenne, Wyoming.:Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Hazard Evaluations and Technical Assistance Branch, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cincinnati, Ohio.:Epidemiology Branch, Office of Public Health, National Park Service, Washington, District of Columbia.:Field Support Branch, Division of Reproductive Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Epidemiology Elective Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1111/zph.12585"

Incidence and severity of pertussis are typically higher in neonates and young infants. As a strategy to protect these young infants, maternal vaccination with Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) has been recommended in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy on the anti-pertussis toxin (PT) IgG response in mothers and their infants at birth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Maternal and cord blood samples were collected from vaccinated (n=243) and unvaccinated (n=75) pregnant women, at the time of delivery, from July 2015 to August 2016 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Anti-PT IgG antibodies were quantified by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and geometric mean concentrations (GMC) were calculated. Relationship between timing of vaccination and antibody concentrations were evaluated. RESULTS: Maternal and cord blood GMCs among the vaccinated group were 5.4 and 5.6 fold higher [66.5 International Units (IU)/mL and 89.8IU/mL] compared to the unvaccinated group (12.4IU/mL and 16.1IU/mL), respectively (p<0.001). Higher anti-PT IgG GMCs were observed when vaccination occurred >/=60days before delivery compared to <60days, suggesting that vaccination early in the third trimester may be more effective than later in pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Tdap maternal vaccination results in significantly higher anti-PT IgG in newborn infants and supports the current recommendation of the Brazilian Immunization Program.","1873-2518:Vaz-de-Lima, Lourdes R A:Sato, Helena Keico:Fernandes, Eder Gatti:Sato, Ana Paula Sayuri:Pawloski, Lucia C:Tondella, Maria Lucia:de Brito, Cyro A:Luna, Expedito J A:Carvalhanas, Telma Regina M P:de Castilho, Euclides A:Maternal Pertussis Vaccine Working Group:Journal Article:Netherlands:Vaccine. 2019 May 29. pii: S0264-410X(19)30567-5. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.079.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31153689","Centro de Imunologia, Instituto Adolfo Lutz, Brazil.

We estimated direct and indirect costs associated with severe ARI resulting in hospitalization among children aged <10 years in El Salvador and Panama through the societal perspective. METHODS: During 2012 and 2013, we surveyed caregivers of children hospitalized with ARI about their direct medical (i.e. outpatient consultation, medications, hospital fees), non-medical (transportation, childcare), and indirect costs (lost wages) at discharge and 7 days after discharge. We multiplied subsidized hospital bed cost derived from administrative data by hospitalization days to estimate provider costs. RESULTS: Overall, 638 children were enrolled with a median age of 12 months (IQR 6-23). Their median length of hospitalization was 4 days (IQR 3-6). In El Salvador, caregivers incurred a median of US$38 (IQR 22-72) in direct and indirect costs per illness episode, while the median government-paid hospitalization cost was US$118 (IQR 59-384) generating an overall societal cost of US$219 (IQR 101-416) per severe ARI episode. In Panama, caregivers incurred a median of US$75 (IQR 39-135) iin direct and indirect costs, and the health-care system paid US$280 (IQR 150-420) per hospitalization producing an overall societal cost of US$393 (IQR 258-552). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of severe ARI to caregivers and the health care system was substantive. Our estimates will inform models to estimate national costs of severe ARI and cost-benefit of prevention and treatment strategies.","1532-2742:Jara, Jorge H:Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo:De Leon, Tirza:Luciani, Kathia:Brizuela, Yarisa Sujey:Estripeaut, Dora:Castillo, Juan Miguel:Barahona, Alfredo:Corro, Mary:Cazares, Rafael:Vergara, Ofelina:Rauda, Rafael:Rodriguez, Rosalba:Franco, Danilo:Widdowson, Marc-Alain:Clara, Wilfrido:Alvis-Estrada, Juan P:Murray, Christian Travis:Ortega-Sanchez, Ismael R:Dawood, Fatimah S:Journal Article:England:J Infect. 2019 May 30. pii: S0163-4453(19)30180-X. doi: 10.1016/j.jinf.2019.05.021.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31153920","Centro de Estudios en Salud, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala.

There is little data available on the safety of an extra dose of vaccine. OBJECTIVE: To assess for the presence of adverse events (AEs) most commonly reported following the administration of excess doses of vaccine in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). METHODS: We searched VAERS for US reports where an excess dose of vaccine was administered to a person received from 1/1/2007 through 1/26/2018. We reviewed medical records for all serious reports and a random sample of non-serious reports. The most common AEs among reports of excess dose of vaccine administered were compared with the corresponding AEs for all vaccines reported to VAERS during the same period. RESULTS: Out of 366,815 total VAERS reports received, 5067 (1.4%) reported an excess dose of vaccine was administered; 3898 (76.9%) did not describe an adverse health event (AHE). The most common vaccines reported were trivalent inactivated influenza (15.4%), varicella (13.9%), hepatitis A (11.4%), and measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (11.1%). Among reports where only AHEs were reported, the most common were pyrexia (12.8%), injection site erythema (9.7%), injection site pain (8.9%), and headache (6.6%). The percentage of AHEs among these reports was comparable to all reports submitted to VAERS during the same study period. CONCLUSION: More than three-fourths of reports of an excess dose of vaccine did not describe an AHE. Among reports where an AHE event was reported, we did not observe any unexpected conditions or clustering of AEs.","1873-2518:Moro, Pedro L:Arana, Jorge:Marquez, Paige L:Ng, Carmen:Barash, Faith:Hibbs, Beth F:Cano, Maria:Journal Article:Netherlands:Vaccine. 2019 May 30. pii: S0264-410X(19)30576-6. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.088.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155414","Immunization Safety Office, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Zoonotic and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA.

In the last 10 years, there have been outbreaks of 2009 influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus disease, and Zika virus. Stigma associated with infectious disease can be a barrier to adopting healthy behaviors, leading to more severe health problems, ongoing disease transmission, and difficulty controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Much has been learned about infectious disease and stigma in the context of nearly 4 decades of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic. In this paper, we define stigma, discuss its relevance to infectious disease outbreaks, including how individuals and communities can be affected. Adapting lessons learned from the rich literature on HIV-related stigma, we propose a strategy for reducing stigma during infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease and Zika virus. The implementation of brief, practical strategies such as the ones proposed here might help reduce stigma and facilitate more effective control of emerging infectious diseases.","1938-744x:Fischer, Leah S:Mansergh, Gordon:Lynch, Jonathan:Santibanez, Scott:Journal Article:United States:Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2019 Jun 3:1-6. doi: 10.1017/dmp.2018.157.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156079","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections,Atlanta, GA.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention,Atlanta, GA.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Emergency Operations,Atlanta, GA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1017/dmp.2018.157"

The antimicrobial activity of all isolates was tested by well-diffusion assay and competitive exclusion on broth against Salmonella Montevideo, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes strain N1-002. Thirty-eight LAB strains showed antagonistic effect against at least one of the pathogens tested in this study. Improved inhibitory effect was observed against L. monocytogenes with zones of inhibition up to 24 mm when LAB overnight cultures were used, and up to 21 mm when cell-free filtrates were used. For E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella maximum inhibitions of 12 and 11.5 mm were observed, respectively. On broth, 43 strains reduced L. monocytogenes up to 9.06 log10 CFU/ml, 41 reduced E. coli O157:H7 up to 0.84 log10 CFU/ml, and 32 reduced Salmonella up to 0.94 log10 CFU/ml 24 h after co-inoculation. Twenty-eight LAB isolates that exhibited the highest inhibitory effect among pathogens were further analyzed to determine their antimicrobial resistance profile, adhesion potential, and cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells. All LAB strains tested were susceptible to ampicillin, linezolid, and penicillin. Twenty-six were able to adhere to Caco-2 cells, five were classified as highly adhesive with > 40 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cells. Low cytotoxicity percentages were observed for the candidate LAB strains with values ranging from -5 to 8%. Genotypic identification by whole genome sequencing confirmed all as members of the LAB group; Enterococcus was the genus most frequently isolated with 21 isolates, followed by Pediococcus with 4, and Lactobacillus with 3. In this study, a systematic approach was used for the improved identification of novel LAB strains able to exert antagonistic effect against important foodborne pathogens. Our findings suggest that the selected panel of LAB probiotic strains can be used as biocontrol cultures to inhibit and/or reduce the growth of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7 in different matrices, and environments.","Ayala, Diana I:Cook, Peter W:Franco, Jorge G:Bugarel, Marie:Kottapalli, Kameswara R:Loneragan, Guy H:Brashears, Mindy M:Nightingale, Kendra K:Journal Article:Switzerland:Front Microbiol. 2019 May 17;10:1108. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.01108. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156609","International Center for Food Industry Excellence, Department of Animal and Food Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States.:Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.:Center for Biotechnology and Genomics, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, United States.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.01108"

However, the lack of a high-quality reference genome has hindered the association of phenotypic traits with their genetic basis in this important mosquito. FINDINGS: Here we present a new high-quality A. funestus reference genome (AfunF3) assembled using 240x coverage of long-read single-molecule sequencing for contigging, combined with 100x coverage of short-read Hi-C data for chromosome scaffolding. The assembled contigs total 446 Mbp of sequence and contain substantial duplication due to alternative alleles present in the sequenced pool of mosquitos from the FUMOZ colony. Using alignment and depth-of-coverage information, these contigs were deduplicated to a 211 Mbp primary assembly, which is closer to the expected haploid genome size of 250 Mbp. This primary assembly consists of 1,053 contigs organized into 3 chromosome-scale scaffolds with an N50 contig size of 632 kbp and an N50 scaffold size of 93.811 Mbp, representing a 100-fold improvement in continuity versus the current reference assembly, AfunF1.

We tested the associations between hyperuricemia and knee OA, and examined the role of obesity, using a cross-sectional, nationally representative dataset. METHOD: NHANES III used a multistage, stratified probability cluster design to select U.S. civilians from 1988 to 1994. Using NHANES III we studied adults > 60 years, with or without hyperuricemia (serum urate > 6.8 mg/dL), excluding individuals with gout (i.e., limiting to asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AH)). Radiographic knee OA (RKOA) was defined as Kellgren-Lawrence grade >/= 2 in any knee, and symptomatic RKOA (sRKOA) was defined as RKOA plus knee pain (most days for 6 weeks) in the same knee. RESULTS: AH prevalence was 17.9% (confidence interval (CI) 15.3-20.5). RKOA prevalence was 37.7% overall (CI 35.0-40.3), and was 44.0% for AH vs 36.3% for normouricemic adults (p = 0.056). sRKOA was more prevalent in AH vs normouricemic adults (17.4% vs 10.9%, p=0.046). In multivariate models adjusting for obesity, model-based associations between AH and knee OA were attenuated (for RKOA, prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.14, 95% CI 0.95, 1.36; for sRKOA, PR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.98, 2.01).

Insufficient human resources was identified as a primary barrier to increasing PITC coverage in Zimbabwe. We evaluated if deployment of supplemental PITC providers at public facilities in Zimbabwe was associated with increased numbers of individuals tested and diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: From July 2016 to May 2017, International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) deployed 138 PITC providers to supplement existing ministry healthcare workers offering PITC at 249 facilities. These supplemental providers were assigned to facilities on a weekly basis. Each week, I-TECH providers reported the number of HIV tests and positive diagnoses they performed. Using routine reporting systems, we obtained from each facility the number of clients tested and diagnosed with HIV per month. Including data both before and during the intervention period, and utilizing the weekly variability in placement locations of the supplemental PITC providers, we employed generalized estimating equations to assess if the placement of supplemental PITC providers at a facility was associated with a change in facility outputs. RESULTS: Supplemental PITC providers performed an average of 62 (SD = 52) HIV tests per week and diagnosed 4.4 (SD = 4.9) individuals with HIV per week. However, using facility reports from the same period, we found that each person-week of PITC provider deployment at a facility was associated with an additional 16.7 (95% CI, 12.2-21.1) individuals tested and an additional 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5-1.2) individuals diagnosed with HIV. We also found that staff placement at clinics was associated with a larger increase in HIV testing than staff placement at polyclinics or hospitals (24.0 vs. 9.8; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This program resulted in increased numbers of individuals tested and diagnosed with HIV. The discrepancy between the average weekly HIV tests conducted by supplemental PITC providers (62) and the increase in facility-level HIV tests associated with one week of PITC provider deployment (16.7) suggests that supplemental PITC providers displaced existing staff who may have been reassigned to fulfil other duties at the facility.","1472-6963:Bochner, Aaron F:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8348-3375:Tippett Barr, Beth A:Makunike, Batsirai:Gonese, Gloria:Wazara, Blessing:Mashapa, Richard:Meacham, Elizabeth:Nyika, Ponesai:Ncube, Gertrude:Balachandra, Shirish:Levine, Ruth:Petracca, Frances:Apollo, Tsitsi:Downer, Ann:Wiktor, Stefan Z:NU2GGH001188/U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief:Journal Article:England:BMC Health Serv Res. 2019 Jun 3;19(1):351. doi: 10.1186/s12913-019-4169-z.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159809","International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. bochner@uw.edu.:Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, 325 9th Ave, Box 359932, Seattle, WA, 98104, USA. bochner@uw.edu.:U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Harare, Zimbabwe.:International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), Harare, Zimbabwe.:International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.:Ministry of Health and Child Care, Harare, Zimbabwe.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12913-019-4169-z"

Due to its rarity, risk factors for Ebstein anomaly remain largely unknown. Using national data, we examined 18 potential risk factors for Ebstein anomaly. METHODS: Using 1997-2011 data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a population-based case-control study, we calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for paternal age, maternal socio-demographics, reproductive history, and modifiable risk factors, and infant characteristics reported by mothers of 135 Ebstein anomaly cases and 11,829 controls. RESULTS: Mothers of Ebstein anomaly cases had 4.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.8, 9.5) times the odds of reporting a family history of CHD compared with mothers of controls. Ebstein anomaly was associated with maternal second-hand cigarette smoke exposure at home (odds ratio = 2.2 [95% confidence interval: 1.1, 4.4]), but not maternal cigarette smoking (odds ratio = 1.3 [95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.1]). Odds were elevated, but the 95% confidence interval included 1.0, for maternal marijuana use (odds ratio = 1.8 [95% confidence interval: 0.9, 3.8]) and paternal age >/=40 years at delivery (odds ratio = 1.9 [95% confidence interval: 1.0, 3.5]). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke at home and a family history of CHD were associated with elevated odds of Ebstein anomaly.

METHODS: We determined type-specific HPV in cytology specimens from women aged 20-29years screened for cervical cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northwest in 2007 and in two vaccine era periods: 2012-2013 and 2015-2016. Detection and typing used L1 consensus PCR with hybridization for 37 types, including quadrivalent vaccine types (HPV 6/11/16/18). RESULTS: Among 20-24year-olds in 2012-2013 and 2015-2016, 44% and 64% had a history of >/=1-dose vaccination. VT prevalence decreased from 13.1% in 2007 to 2.9% in 2015-2016 (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.29). HPV 31 prevalence was also lower in the vaccine periods compared with 2007. VT prevalence in 2015-2016 among 20-24year-olds was lower in both vaccinated, 1.3% (PR=0.10; 95% CI 0.06-0.16), and unvaccinated women, 5.8% (PR=0.45; 95% CI 0.33-0.61). Among 25-29year-olds, 21% and 32% had a history of >/=1-dose vaccination. VT prevalence decreased from 8.1% in 2007 to 5.0% in 2015-2016 (PR=0.62; 95% CI 0.50-0.78). Non-VT high risk prevalence was higher in the vaccine periods compared with the pre-vaccine era in both age groups, however, not in 2015-2016 compared with 2012-2013. CONCLUSION: Within 9-10years of vaccine introduction, VT prevalence decreased 78% among 20-24year-olds and 38% in 25-29year-olds.

A considerable amount of evidence-based measures have been published to address these challenges, but the largest challenge seems to be their implementation. Methods: In June 2017, a total of 42 experts convened at the Geneva IPC-Think Tank to discuss four domains in implementation science: 1) teaching implementation skills; 2) fostering implementation of IPC and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) by policy making; 3) national/international actions to foster implementation skills; and 4) translational research bridging social sciences and clinical research in infection prevention and control (IPC) and AMR. Results: Although neglected in the past, implementation skills have become a priority in IPC and AMS. They should now be part of any curriculum in health care, and IPC career paths should be created. Guidelines and policies should be aligned with each other and evidence-based, each document providing a section on implementing elements of IPC and AMS in patient care. International organisations should be advocates for IPC and AMS, framing them as patient safety issues and emphasizing the importance of implementation skills. Healthcare authorities at the national level should adopt a similar approach and provide legal frameworks, guidelines, and resources to allow better implementation of patient safety measures in IPC and AMS. Rather than repeating effectiveness studies in every setting, we should invest in methods to improve the implementation of evidence-based measures in different healthcare contexts. For this, we need to encourage and financially support collaborations between social sciences and clinical IPC research. Conclusions: Experts of the 2017 Geneva Think Tank on IPC and AMS, CDC, and WHO agreed that sustained efforts on implementation of IPC and AMS strategies are required at international, country, and hospital management levels, to provide an adequate multimodal framework that addresses (not exclusively) leadership, resources, education and training for implementing IPC and AMS. Future strategies can build on this agreement to make strategies on IPC and AMS more effective.","2047-2994:Zingg, Walter:Storr, Julie:Park, Benjamin J:Ahmad, Raheelah:Tarrant, Carolyn:Castro-Sanchez, Enrique:Tomczyk, Sara:Kilpatrick, Claire:Allegranzi, Benedetta:Cardo, Denise:Pittet, Didier:2017 Geneva IPC-Think Tank:Journal Article:England:Antimicrob Resist Infect Control. 2019 May 28;8:87. doi: 10.1186/s13756-019-0527-1. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161034","1Infection Control Programme and WHO Collaborating Center, University of Geneva Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine, 4 Rue Gabrielle Perret-Gentil, 1211, 14 Geneva, Switzerland.0000 0001 0721 9812grid.150338.c:2Infection Prevention and Control Global Unit, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.0000000121633745grid.3575.4:3US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA USA.0000 0001 2163 0069grid.416738.f:4National Institute for Health Research in Healthcare Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, Imperial College London, London, UK.0000 0001 2113 8111grid.7445.2:5Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.0000 0004 1936 8411grid.9918.9",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s13756-019-0527-1"

The objective of this study was to estimate the peak, average, and determinants of real-time total volatile organic compound (TVOC) exposure associated with cleaning tasks and product-use. TVOC exposures were measured using monitors equipped with a photoionization detector (PID). A simple correction factor was applied to the real-time measurements, calculated as a ratio of the full-shift average TVOC concentrations from a time-integrated canister and the PID sample, for each sample pair. During sampling, auxiliary information, e.g. tasks, products used, engineering controls, was recorded on standardized data collection forms at 5-min intervals. Five-minute averaged air measurements (n = 10 276) from 129 time-series comprising 92 workers and four hospitals were used to model the determinants of exposures. The statistical model simultaneously accounted for censored data and non-stationary autocorrelation and was fit using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo within a Bayesian context. Log-transformed corrected concentrations (cTVOC) were modeled, with the fixed-effects of tasks and covariates, that were systematically gathered during sampling, and random effect of person-day. The model-predicted geometric mean (GM) cTVOC concentrations ranged from 387 parts per billion (ppb) for the task of using a product containing formaldehyde in laboratories to 2091 ppb for the task of using skin wipes containing quaternary ammonium compounds, with a GM of 925 ppb when no products were used. Peak exposures quantified as the 95th percentile of 15-min averages for these tasks ranged from 3172 to 17 360 ppb. Peak and GM task exposures varied by occupation and hospital unit. In the multiple regression model, use of sprays was associated with increasing exposures, while presence of local exhaust ventilation, large room volume, and automatic sterilizer use were associated with decreasing exposures. A detailed understanding of factors affecting TVOC exposure can inform targeted interventions to reduce exposures and can be used in epidemiologic studies as metrics of short-duration peak exposures.","2398-7316:Virji, M Abbas:Liang, Xiaoming:Su, Feng-Chiao:LeBouf, Ryan F:Stefaniak, Aleksandr B:Stanton, Marcia L:Henneberger, Paul K:Houseman, E Andres:Journal Article:England:Ann Work Expo Health. 2019 Jun 4. pii: 5510588. doi: 10.1093/annweh/wxz043.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161189","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Respiratory Health Division, Mailstop H-2800, Morgantown, WV, USA.:Independent Consultant, La Center, WA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/annweh/wxz043"

However, such associations are frequently idiosyncratic and cannot be generalized for diagnostics. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been shown to be functionally associated with several cancer types. Here, we study the association of intra-host mtDNA diversity with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). RESULTS: UDS mtDNA exome data from blood of patients with HCC (n = 293) and non-cancer controls (NC, n = 391) were used to: (i) measure the genetic heterogeneity of nucleotide sites from the entire population of intra-host mtDNA variants rather than to detect specific mutations, and (ii) apply machine learning algorithms to develop a classifier for HCC detection. Average total entropy of HCC mtDNA is 1.24-times lower than of NC mtDNA (p = 2.84E-47). Among all polymorphic sites, 2.09% had a significantly different mean entropy between HCC and NC, with 0.32% of the HCC mtDNA sites having greater (p < 0.05) and 1.77% of the sites having lower mean entropy (p < 0.05) as compared to NC. The entropy profile of each sample was used to further explore the association between mtDNA heterogeneity and HCC by means of a Random Forest (RF) classifier The RF-classifier separated 232 HCC and 232 NC patients with accuracy of up to 99.78% and average accuracy of 92.23% in the 10-fold cross-validation. The classifier accurately separated 93.08% of HCC (n = 61) and NC (n = 159) patients in a validation dataset that was not used for the RF parameter optimization. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphic sites contributing most to the mtDNA association with HCC are scattered along the mitochondrial genome, affecting all mitochondrial genes. The findings suggest that application of heterogeneity profiles of intra-host mtDNA variants from blood may help overcome barriers associated with the complex association of specific mutations with cancer, enabling the development of accurate, rapid, inexpensive and minimally invasive diagnostic detection of cancer.","1755-8794:Campo, David S:Nayak, Vishal:Srinivasamoorthy, Ganesh:Khudyakov, Yury:Journal Article:England:BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Jun 6;12(Suppl 4):74. doi: 10.1186/s12920-019-0506-7.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167647","Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. fyv6@cdc.gov.:Office of Advanced Molecular Detection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.:CSRA, Inc, Corporate Blvd NE, Atlanta, GA, USA.:Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12920-019-0506-7"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of stages of limitations in ADLs on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the relative severity of each ADL limitation for a large, nationally-representative sample of the U.S. community-dwelling older population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Limited Dataset of the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey Cohort 15 (2012 baseline survey, 2014 follow-up survey). We included respondents aged >/=65 years (n=105,473). We estimated expected QALYs throughout the remaining lifetime of participants stratified by the ADL limitation status and stages of ADL limitations. RESULTS: Overall, the expected QALYs was 5.6 years. QALYs decreased with increasing stages of ADL limitations. The adjusted QALYs for Stage 0 (no limitation) participants were 6.8; for Stage I (mild) participants, 3.9; for Stage II (moderate) participants, 2.2; for Stage III (severe) participants, 1.8; and for Stage IV (complete limitations) participants, 1.5. Differences in QALYs occurred between individual ADL items within an ADL stage. In Stage I, for example, participants who reported only problems with getting in or out of chairs had 6.7 QALYs which was markedly higher than participants who reported only problems with walking (3.8 QALYs). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional evidence that Stineman's ADL stages serve as valid estimates of the overall health of elderly Americans. Self-reported ADL status should be routinely collected as a patient-reported outcome in the elderly population.","1876-7583:Jia, Haomiao:Lubetkin, Erica I:DeMichele, Kimberly:Stark, Debra S:Zack, Matthew M:Thompson, William W:Journal Article:United States:Disabil Health J. 2019 May 21. pii: S1936-6574(19)30096-2. doi: 10.1016/j.dhjo.2019.05.003.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167742","Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health and School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

We conducted area and personal air sampling during three instructional scenarios per day involving the burning of two types (designated as alpha and bravo) of oriented strand board (OSB), pallet and straw, or the use of simulated smoke, over a period of 5 days. Twenty-four firefighters and ten instructors participated. Firefighters participated in each scenario once (separated by about 48 hr) and instructors supervised three training exercise per scenarios (completed in 1 day). Personal air samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen cyanide during live-fire scenarios (excluding simulated smoke). Area air samples were analyzed for acid gases, aldehydes, isocyanates, and VOCs for all scenarios. For the live-fire scenarios, median personal air concentrations of benzene and PAHs exceeded applicable short-term exposure limits and were higher among firefighters than instructors. When comparing results by type of fuel, personal air concentrations of benzene and PAHs were higher for bravo OSB compared to other fuels. Median area air concentrations of aldehydes and isocyanates were also highest during the bravo OSB scenario, while pallet and straw produced the highest median concentrations of certain VOCs and acid gases. These results suggest usage of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) by both instructors and firefighters is essential during training fires to reduce potential inhalation exposure.

METHODS: Using HPTN-067 survey data, we developed scales examining 1) Low Perceived External Support for PrEP: low perceived support by others for PrEP use or perceived negative reactions to the pill case (scoring ranges from 0 to 2) and 2) Participant-Staff Disclosure Challenges Scale which identifies challenges to sharing non-use of PrEP or condoms to study staff (scoring ranges from 0 to 4); these scales are the primary independent variables. Adherence, the dependent variable, was determined using log-transformed plasma TFV concentrations. GEE linear regression was used to assess the association between both scales and adherence. RESULTS: Participants (n=161) included HIV-uninfected women in South Africa, and men who have sex with men and transgender women, in Thailand and the U.S. In multivariable analyses, higher scores in the Participant-Staff Disclosure Challenges Scale were significantly associated with lower PrEP adherence (exp(beta) = 0.62, 95% CI (0.46- 0.84); p=0.002) as were increased days since the last PrEP dose (exp(beta) = 0.73, 95% CI (0.65- 0.83); p</=0.001).

Persons </=17 years of age had a significantly higher prevalence of being retained in care (PR=1.2, 95%CI=1.2-1.3) and virally suppressed (PR=1.4, 95%CI=1.3-1.5) than persons aged 18-25 years. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve care outcomes among persons with PHIV are needed. Enhanced collaboration between pediatric and adult medical providers may ensure continuity of care during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.","1944-7884:Gray, Kristen Mahle:Banez Ocfemia, M Cheryl:Wang, Xiao:Li, Jianmin:Nesheim, Steven R:Journal Article:United States:J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2019 Jun 4. doi: 10.1097/QAI.0000000000002091.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169773","Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:ICF, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/qai.0000000000002091"

For the nearly one in 10 infants born prematurely in the United States annually (1), breast milk is especially beneficial, helping prevent sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis and promoting neurologic development (2). National estimates of newborn feeding practices by gestational age have not been available previously. CDC analyzed 2017 birth certificate data from 48 states and the District of Columbia (3,194,873; 82.7% of all births) to describe receipt of breast milk among extremely preterm (20-27 weeks), early preterm (28-33 weeks), late preterm (34-36 weeks), and term (>/=37 weeks) infants with further stratification by maternal and infant characteristics. The prevalence of infants receiving any breast milk was 83.9% overall and varied by gestational age, with 71.3% of extremely preterm infants, 76.0% of early preterm infants, 77.3% of late preterm infants, and 84.6% of term infants receiving any breast milk. Disparities in receipt of breast milk by several sociodemographic factors, including maternal race/ethnicity, were noted across gestational age groups. These estimates suggest that many infants, particularly infants at high risk for medical complications, might not be receiving breast milk.

To reduce mosquitoborne disease transmission, the USVI Department of Health (VIDOH) is responsible for integrated mosquito management. During January 2016-January 2018, USVI experienced its first Zika outbreak, with most cases reported during January-December 2016, as well as two Category 5 hurricanes (Irma on St. Thomas/St. John on September 6, 2017, and Maria on St. Croix on September 19, 2017). The hurricanes severely damaged mosquito protection-related building structures (e.g., screens, roofs) and infrastructure (e.g., electricity, air conditioning) and might have created an environment more conducive to mosquito breeding. VIDOH, with requested technical assistance from CDC, conducted three Community Assessments for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPERs) to provide rapid community information at the household level. The three CASPERs were conducted to inform 1) the Zika outbreak response, 2) the hurricane response, and 3) the hurricane recovery. The CASPERs assessed mosquito prevention and control-related experiences, attitudes, and practices; household and environmental conditions associated with mosquito breeding, prevention, and control; and other nonmosquito-related information to inform outbreak and disaster response planning. Approximately 40% of households were very concerned about contracting Zika virus during the Zika outbreak and hurricane responses. Environmental conditions were reported to become more favorable for mosquito breeding between the Zika outbreak and hurricane response. Between 75%-80% of the community supported mosquito-spraying in all assessments. VIDOH used these data to support real-time outbreak and hurricane response planning. Mosquito prevention and control community assessments can provide rapid, actionable information to advise both mosquito education and control and emergency response and recovery efforts.

In 2015, this goal was included as a priority in the Eastern Mediterranean Vaccine Action Plan 2016-2020 (2), approved at the 62nd session of the Regional Committee (3). To achieve measles elimination, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean developed the following four-pronged strategy: 1) achieve >/=95% vaccination coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) among children in every district of each country through routine immunization services; 2) achieve >/=95% vaccination coverage with a second MCV dose in every district of each country either through implementation of a routine 2-dose vaccination schedule or through supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)( section sign); 3) conduct high-quality, case-based measles surveillance in all countries; and 4) provide optimal measles clinical case management, including dietary supplementation with vitamin A (4). Pakistan, an EMR country with a population of approximately 200 million, accounts for nearly one third of the overall EMR population. This report describes progress and challenges toward measles elimination in Pakistan during 2000-2018. During the study period, estimated coverage with the first MCV dose (MCV1) increased from 57% in 2000 to 76% in 2017. The second MCV dose (MCV2) was introduced nationwide in 2009, and MCV2 coverage increased from 30% in 2009 to 45% in 2017. During 2000-2018, approximately 232.5 million children received doses of MCV during SIAs.

In 2017 and 2018, the rates of suspected cases discarded as nonmeasles after investigation were 2.1 and 1.5 per 100,000 population, reflecting underreporting of cases. To achieve measles elimination, additional efforts are needed to increase MCV1 and MCV2 coverage, develop strategies to identify and reach communities not accessing immunization services, and increase sensitivity of case-based measles surveillance in all districts.","1545-861x:Mere, Mohammed Osama:Goodson, James L:Chandio, Arshad K:Rana, Muhammad Suleman:Hasan, Quamrul:Teleb, Nadia:Alexander, James P Jr:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 Jun 7;68(22):505-510. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6822a4.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170125",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6822a4"

These cancer survivors face many challenges, including functional limitations, serious psychological distress (2), and other lasting and late effects of cancer treatments. Because of the high cost of cancer therapy, many cancer survivors are more likely to face substantial out-of-pocket health care expenditures and financial hardship, compared with persons without a history of cancer (3,4). Out-of-pocket expenditures and financial hardship associated with cancer have been higher among survivors aged 18-64 years than they have been among older survivors (5). To estimate annual out-of-pocket expenditures and financial hardship among cancer survivors aged 18-64 years, compared with persons without a cancer history, CDC, the American Cancer Society, and the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from the 2011-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).* The average annual out-of-pocket spending per person was significantly higher among cancer survivors ($1,000; 95% confidence interval [CI] = $886-$1,113) than among persons without a cancer history ($622; CI = $606-$639). Financial hardship was common; 25.3% of cancer survivors reported material hardship (e.g., problems paying medical bills), and 34.3% reported psychological hardship (e.g., worry about medical bills). These findings add to accumulating evidence documenting the financial difficulties of many cancer survivors. Mitigating the negative impact of cancer in the United States will require implementation of strategies aimed at alleviating the disproportionate financial hardship experienced by many survivors. These strategies include systematic screening for financial hardship at cancer diagnosis and throughout cancer care, integration of discussions about the potential for adverse financial consequences of treatments in shared treatment decision-making, and linkage of patients and survivors to available resources to ensure access to high-quality evidence-based care.","1545-861x:Ekwueme, Donatus U:Zhao, Jingxuan:Rim, Sun Hee:de Moor, Janet S:Zheng, Zhiyuan:Khushalani, Jaya S:Han, Xuesong:Kent, Erin E:Yabroff, K Robin:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 Jun 7;68(22):494-499. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6822a2.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170127",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6822a2"

Underreporting of HBV and HCV infections has long been identified as a problem. Few reports have described the accuracy of state surveillance case registries for recording clinically-confirmed cases of HBV and HCV infections, or the characteristics of populations associated with lower rates of reporting. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the current study is to estimate the proportion of HBV and HCV infections that went unreported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDoH), among patients in the Geisinger Health System of Pennsylvania. As a secondary objective, we study the association between underreporting of HBV and HCV infections to PDoH, and the select patient characteristics of interest: sex, age group, race/ethnicity, rural status, and year of initial diagnosis. DESIGN: Per medical record review, the study population was limited to Geisinger Health System patients, residing in Pennsylvania, who were diagnosed with a chronic HBV and/or HCV infection, between 2001 and 2015. Geisinger Health System patient medical records were matched to surveillance records of confirmed cases reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDoH). To quantify the extent that underreporting occurred among the Geisinger Health System study participants, we calculated the proportion of study participants that were not reported to PDoH as confirmed cases of HBV or HCV infections. An analysis of adjusted prevalence ratio estimates was conducted to study the association between underreporting of HBV and HCV infections to PDoH, and the select patient characteristics of interest. RESULTS: Geisinger Health System patients living with HBV were reported to PDoH 88.4% (152 of 172) of the time; patients living with HCV were reported to PDoH 94.6% (2,257 of 2,386) of the time; and patients who were co-infected with both viruses were reported to PDoH 72.0% (18 of 25) of the time. Patients living with HCV had an increased likelihood of being reported if they were: less than or equal to age 30 vs ages 65+ {PR = 1.2, [95%CI, (1.1, 1.3)]}, and if they received their initial diagnosis of HCV during the 2010-2015 time period vs the 1990-1999 time period {PR = 1.08, [95%CI, (1.05, 1.12)]}. CONCLUSION: The findings in this study are promising, and suggests that PDoH has largely been successful with tracking and monitoring viral hepatitis B and C infections, among persons that were tested for HBV and/or HCV. Additional efforts should be placed on decreasing underreporting rates of HCV infections among seniors (ages 65 and over), and persons who are co-infected with HBV and HCV.","1932-6203:Roberts, Henry:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4528-0811:Boktor, Sameh W:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9651-7706:Waller, Kirsten:Daar, Zahra S:Boscarino, Joseph A:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9965-6805:Dubin, Perry H:Suryaprasad, Anil:Moorman, Anne C:Journal Article:United States:PLoS One. 2019 Jun 6;14(6):e0217455. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0217455. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170165","Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Pennsylvania Department of Health, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States of America.:Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania, United States of America.:Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.:Mayo Clinic Radiation and Oncology, Jacksonville, Florida, United States of America.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0217455"

METHODS: The evaluation covered the period of 2012-2015 and used different data sources to measure indicators related to data quality and completeness, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, flexibility, stability and utility. RESULTS: During the evaluation period, 485.221 ILI cases were reported among 6.386.621 outpatients at 268 ILI sentinel sites. To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.","1471-2458:Yazidi, Rihab:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1122-1629:Aissi, Wafa:Bouguerra, Hind:Nouira, Mariem:Kharroubi, Ghassen:Maazaoui, Latifa:Zorraga, Mokhtar:Abdeddaiem, Naima:Chlif, Sadok:El Moussi, Awatef:Ben Hadj Kacem, Mohamed Ali:Snoussi, Mohamed Ali:Ghawar, Wissem:Koubaa, Makram:Polansky, Lauren:McCarron, Margaret:Boussarsar, Mohamed:Menif, Khaled:Amine, Slim:Ben Khelil, Jalila:Ben Jemaa, Mounir:Bettaieb, Jihene:Bouafif Ben Alaya, Nissaf:Ben Salah, Afif:1U51IP00822/National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases:Journal Article:England:BMC Public Health. 2019 Jun 6;19(1):694. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-7035-3.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170955","Laboratory of Transmission, Control and Immunobiology of Infections (LR11IPT02), Institut Pasteur de Tunis, 13, Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Tunis-Belvedere, Tunisia. rihabyazidi@yahoo.fr.:University of Carthage, Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, Jarzouna, 7021, Bizerte, Tunisia. rihabyazidi@yahoo.fr.:National Institute of Public Health, 5-7 rue El-Khartoum, Tunis, Tunisia.:Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.:Observatoire National des Maladies Nouvelles et Emergentes de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.:Service of Medical Epidemiology, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, 13, Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Tunis-Belvedere, Tunisia.:Primary Health Care Directorate, Tunis, Tunisia.:National Influenza Centre-Tunis, Unit Virology, Microbiology Laboratory, Charles Nicolle's Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.:Laboratory of Transmission, Control and Immunobiology of Infections (LR11IPT02), Institut Pasteur de Tunis, 13, Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Tunis-Belvedere, Tunisia.:Department of Infectious Diseases, Hedi Chaker University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd NE, Mailstop A20, Atlanta, GA, 30329-4027, USA.:Medical Intensive Care Unit Farhat Hached University Hospital, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.:Research Laboratory, Heart Failure, N LR12SP09 Ibn Al Jazzar Faculty of Medicine, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.:Non Invasive Ventilation Specialized Master Coordinator Ibn Al Jazzar, Faculty of Medicine, 4000, Sousse, Tunisia.:Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital Bechir Hamza of Tunis, Place Bab Saadoun, 1007, Tunis, Tunisia.:Intensive care department Abderrahmen Mami Hospital, Ariana, Tunisia.:Laboratory of Transmission, Control and Immunobiology of Infections (LR11IPT02), Institut Pasteur de Tunis, 13, Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Tunis-Belvedere, Tunisia. afif.bensalah@pasteur.tn.:Service of Medical Epidemiology, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, 13, Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Tunis-Belvedere, Tunisia. afif.bensalah@pasteur.tn.:Department of Family and Community Medicine, College of Medicine and Medical Sciences (CMMS), Arabian Gulf University (AGU), Manama, Bahrain. afif.bensalah@pasteur.tn.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s12889-019-7035-3"

Vector control programs are often directed by national governments, but are carried out at the local level, resulting in the discounting of spatial heterogeneities in ecology and epidemiology. Furthermore, entomological and epidemiological data are often collected by separate governmental entities, which can slow vector control responses to outbreaks. Colombia has adopted several approaches to address these issues. First, a web-based, georeferenced Aedes surveillance system called SIVIEN AEDES was developed to allow field entomologists to record vector abundance and insecticide resistance data. Second, autocidal gravid oviposition (AGO) traps are deployed as an alternative way to measure vector abundance. Third, data collected by SIVIEN AEDES are used to develop mathematical models predicting Ae. aegypti abundance down to a city block, thus allowing public health authorities to target interventions to specific neighborhoods within cities. Finally, insecticide resistance is monitored through bioassays and molecular testing in 15 high-priority cities, providing a comprehensive basis to inform decisions about insecticide use in different regions. The next step will be to synchronize SIVIEN AEDES data together with epidemiological and climatic data to improve the understanding of the drivers of local variations in arbovirus transmission dynamics. By integrating these surveillance data, health authorities will be better equipped to develop tailored and timely solutions to control and prevent Aedes-borne arbovirus outbreaks.","1680-5348:Guagliardo, Sarah Anne J:Ardila Roldan, Susana Carolina:Santacoloma, Liliana:Luna, Cesar:Cordovez Alvarez, Juan Manuel:Rojas Gacha, Juan David:Mansur, Mariana:Levine, Rebecca S:Lenhart, Audrey:Oviedo, Patricia Fuya:Journal Article:United States:Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2019 Jun 7;43:e50. doi: 10.26633/RPSP.2019.50. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171922","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Epidemic Intelligence Service, Atlanta Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemic Intelligence Service, Atlanta Georgia United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Epidemic Intelligence Service, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.:Instituto Nacional de Salud, Grupo de Entomologia Instituto Nacional de Salud, Grupo de Entomologia Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia Bogota Colombia Instituto Nacional de Salud, Grupo de Entomologia, Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia, Bogota, Colombia.:Universidad de los Andes Universidad de los Andes Departamento de Ingenieria Biomedica Bogota Colombia Universidad de los Andes, Departamento de Ingenieria Biomedica, Bogota, Colombia.:Departamento de Matematicas, Universidad Nacional de Colombia Departamento de Matematicas, Universidad Nacional de Colombia Bogota Colombia Departamento de Matematicas, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.:Task Force for Global Health, Decatur Task Force for Global Health, Decatur Georgia United States of America Task Force for Global Health, Decatur, Georgia, United States of America.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Atlanta Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Atlanta Georgia United States of America Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.26633/rpsp.2019.50"

Half of the Syrians were children aged </=18 years. Our study sought to examine undernutrition and overnutrition among a group of Syrian refugee children who underwent medical screening by IOM for resettlement. Methods: This is a retrospective review of Syrian refugee children aged 6 to 59 months from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. The World Health Organization (WHO) Stata package computed Z-scores based on available weight and height data. Prevalence estimates of undernutrition (wasting and stunting) and overnutrition (overweight and obesity) were made using WHO standards. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the factors associated with wasting, stunting, and overnutrition, adjusting for age, sex, family size, and country of health assessment. Results: A total of 14,552 Syrian refugee children aged 6 to 59 months underwent health assessments in Jordan (43.1%), Lebanon (38.8%), Turkey (7.0%), Greece (6.7%), Egypt (2.4%), and Iraq (2.1%). Overall, this group of Syrian refugee children had a low prevalence of wasting (< 5%) and stunting (< 10%), and high prevalence of overweight or obese (10.6%). Differences were observed in the prevalence of wasting by country of health assessment. In the multiple regression analysis, the prevalence of stunting and overnutrition decreased with increasing age, and being male was associated with overnutrition but not wasting and stunting. Conclusions: Findings revealed an overall low prevalence of undernutrition among this group of Syrian children assessed, although prevalence varied by age group. This low prevalence may reflect the effectiveness, as well as expose possible gaps, of refugee nutrition programs or interventions in countries of asylum. Further studies are recommended to evaluate other possible contributors to malnutrition in this refugee group.","Pernitez-Agan, Sweetmavourneen:Wickramage, Kolitha:Yen, Catherine:Dawson-Hahn, Elizabeth:Mitchell, Tarissa:Zenner, Dominik:Journal Article:England:Confl Health. 2019 Jun 4;13:22. doi: 10.1186/s13031-019-0208-y. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171934","Migration Health Division, International Organization for Migration, Manila, Philippines.:Migration Health Division, International Organization for Migration, Washington, DC USA.:3Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA USA.0000000122986657grid.34477.33:4Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA USA.0000 0000 9026 4165grid.240741.4:5Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA USA.0000 0001 2163 0069grid.416738.f:Migration Health Division, International Organization for Migration, Brussels, Belgium.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1186/s13031-019-0208-y"

Between April and August 2017, we conducted an on-line survey of a representative sample of PCPs in six Southeast jurisdictions with high rates of HIV diagnoses (Atlanta; Baltimore; Baton Rouge; District of Columbia; Miami; New Orleans). We defined HIV-related training as self-reported completion of any certified HIV/STD course or continuing education in past 24 months (prior to survey completion). We assessed associations between training and HIV testing practices, familiarity with nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and ever prescribing nPEP or PrEP. There were 820 participants after fielding 4595 surveys (29.6% adjusted response rate). In weighted analyses, 36.3% reported HIV-related training. Using adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) and confidence intervals (CI), we found that PCPs with HIV-related training (compared to those with no training) were more likely to be familiar with nPEP (aPR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.05, 1.67) and PrEP (aPR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.19, 2.38); and to have ever prescribed PrEP to patients (aPR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10, 2.78).

We estimate the cost for evidence-based intervention and non-evidence-based intervention screening promotion activities and examine expenditures on screening promotion activities. We also identify factors associated with the costs of these activities. METHODS: By using cost and resource use data collected from 25 state grantees over multiple years (July 2009 to June 2014), we analyzed the total cost for each screening promotion activity. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the factors associated with screening promotion costs reported by grantees. RESULTS: The promotion activities with the largest allocation of funding across the years and grantees were mass media, patient navigation, outreach and education, and small media. Across all years of the program and across grantees, the amount spent on specific promotion activities varied widely. The factor significantly associated with promotion costs was region in which the grantee was located. CONCLUSION: CDC's CRCCP grantees spent the largest amount of the screening promotion funds on mass media, which is not recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force. Given the large variation across grantees in the use of and expenditures on screening promotion interventions, a systematic assessment of the yield from investment in specific promotion activities could better guide optimal resource allocation.","1545-1151:Tangka, Florence K L:Subramanian, Sujha:Hoover, Sonja:Cole-Beebe, Maggie:DeGroff, Amy:Joseph, Djenaba:Chattopadhyay, Sajal:Journal Article:United States:Prev Chronic Dis. 2019 Jun 6;16:E72. doi: 10.5888/pcd16.180337.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172915","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, 4770 Buford Hwy, NE, MS F-76, Atlanta, GA 30341-3717.

METHODS: We linked cigarette smoking data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) data set to 7 social and physical environmental characteristics: county type (metropolitan designation), primary care physician density, income inequality, percentage of the population that was a racial/ethnic minority, violent crime rate, education, and percentage of county residents with low income and no health insurance, all obtained from several county data sets. Spatial regression and hierarchical logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Results showed that metropolitan counties with a high proportion of non-Hispanic white adults (P < .001), lower education levels (high school graduate or less) (P < .001), and high violent crime rates (P < .001) had a higher adult cigarette smoking prevalence than other metropolitan counties. Spatial models showed 63.3% of the variability in county cigarette smoking prevalence was explained by these 3 factors as well as county type (based on population size of the of metropolitan area), primary care physician density, and percentage of county residents with low income and no health insurance. At an individual level, results showed that as the density (population) of primary care physicians increased in a county, the odds of being a current smoker decreased (OR, 0.980; P = .02). CONCLUSION: We found a significant association between adult cigarette smoking and county social and physical environmental factors. These place-based factors, especially social environmental characteristics, may reveal tobacco-related disparities to be considered when developing strategies to reduce tobacco use.","1545-1151:Caraballo, Ralph S:Rice, Ketra L:Neff, Linda J:Garrett, Bridgette E:Journal Article:United States:Prev Chronic Dis. 2019 Jun 6;16:E71. doi: 10.5888/pcd16.180373.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31172916","Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy, NE, MS S107-7, Atlanta, 30341-3717.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how cervical cancer stage at diagnosis is associated with rurality and race/ethnicity. METHODS: We analyzed 2010 through 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. We compared cervical cancer frequency and age-adjusted incidence for each stage by county-level rurality and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: There were 59,432 incident cases of cervical cancer reported from 2010 through 2014. The most common stage at diagnosis was localized (urban, 43.3%; rural 41.3%). Rural counties had higher incidence than urban counties for localized (rate ratio [RR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.15), regional (RR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.19), and distant (RR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19) stage cervical cancer. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women had higher incidence of regional and distant cervical cancer than non-Hispanic white women. Non-Hispanic white women in rural counties had higher incidence than those in urban counties at every stage. However, incidence for non-Hispanic white women was lower than for non-Hispanic black or Hispanic women. CONCLUSION: Rural counties had higher incidence of cervical cancer than urban counties at every stage.

To address the goals of achieving and maintaining global eradication and minimising the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-derived polioviruses, we tested novel monovalent oral type-2 poliovirus (OPV2) vaccine candidates that are genetically more stable than existing OPVs, with a lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence. Our study represents the first in-human testing of these two novel OPV2 candidates. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines, the presence and extent of faecal shedding, and the neurovirulence of shed virus. METHODS: In this double-blind, single-centre phase 1 trial, we isolated participants in a purpose-built containment facility at the University of Antwerp Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium), to minimise the risk of environmental release of the novel OPV2 candidates. Participants, who were recruited by local advertising, were adults (aged 18-50 years) in good health who had previously been vaccinated with IPV, and who would not have any contact with immunosuppressed or unvaccinated people for the duration of faecal shedding at the end of the study. The first participant randomly chose an envelope containing the name of a vaccine candidate, and this determined their allocation; the next 14 participants to be enrolled in the study were sequentially allocated to this group and received the same vaccine. The subsequent 15 participants enrolled after this group were allocated to receive the other vaccine. Participants and the study staff were masked to vaccine groups until the end of the study period. Participants each received a single dose of one vaccine candidate (candidate 1, S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3; or candidate 2, S2/S15domV/CpG40), and they were monitored for adverse events, immune responses, and faecal shedding of the vaccine virus for 28 days. Shed virus isolates were tested for the genetic stability of attenuation. The primary outcomes were the incidence and type of serious and severe adverse events, the proportion of participants showing viral shedding in their stools, the time to cessation of viral shedding, the cell culture infective dose of shed virus in virus-positive stools, and a combined index of the prevalence, duration, and quantity of viral shedding in all participants. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2017-000908-21 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03430349. FINDINGS: Between May 22 and Aug 22, 2017, 48 volunteers were screened, of whom 15 (31%) volunteers were excluded for reasons relating to the inclusion or exclusion criteria, three (6%) volunteers were not treated because of restrictions to the number of participants in each group, and 30 (63%) volunteers were sequentially allocated to groups (15 participants per group). Both novel OPV2 candidates were immunogenic and increased the median blood titre of serum neutralising antibodies; all participants were seroprotected after vaccination. Both candidates had acceptable tolerability, and no serious adverse events occurred during the study. However, severe events were reported in six (40%) participants receiving candidate 1 (eight events) and nine (60%) participants receiving candidate 2 (12 events); most of these events were increased blood creatinine phosphokinase but were not accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms. Vaccine virus was detected in the stools of 15 (100%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 1 and 13 (87%) participants receiving vaccine candidate 2. Vaccine poliovirus shedding stopped at a median of 23 days (IQR 15-36) after candidate 1 administration and 12 days (1-23) after candidate 2 administration. Total shedding, described by the estimated median shedding index (50% cell culture infective dose/g), was observed to be greater with candidate 1 than candidate 2 across all participants (2.8 [95% CI 1.8-3.5] vs 1.0 [0.7-1.6]). Reversion to neurovirulence, assessed as paralysis of transgenic mice, was low in isolates from those vaccinated with both candidates, and sequencing of shed virus indicated that there was no loss of attenuation in domain V of the 5'-untranslated region, the primary site of reversion in Sabin OPV. INTERPRETATION: We found that the novel OPV2 candidates were safe and immunogenic in IPV-immunised adults, and our data support the further development of these vaccines to potentially be used for maintaining global eradication of neurovirulent type-2 polioviruses.

We investigated the effects of this introduction on pneumococcal colonisation and invasive disease in children aged <5 years. METHODS: Six colonisation surveys were done between January 2014 and January 2018 in children attending the outpatient department of a non-governmental paediatric hospital in Siem Reap. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed by phenotypic and genotypic methods to detect pneumococcal serotypes and antimicrobial resistance. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) data for January 2012 - December 2018 were retrieved from hospital databases. Pre-PCV IPD data and pre-/post-PCV colonisation data were modelled to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE). RESULTS: Comparing 2014 with 2016-2018, and using adjusted prevalence ratios, vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for colonisation were 16.6% (95% CI 10.6-21.8) for all pneumococci and 39.2% (26.7-46.1) for vaccine serotype (VT) pneumococci. There was a 26.0% (17.7-33.0) decrease in multi-drug resistant pneumococcal colonisation. IPD incidence was estimated to have declined by 26.4% (14.4-35.8) by 2018, with a decrease of 36.3% (23.8-46.9) for VT IPD and an increase of 101.4% (62.0-145.4) for non-vaccine serotype IPD. CONCLUSIONS: Following PCV13 introduction into the Cambodian immunisation schedule there have been declines in VT pneumococcal colonisation and disease in children aged <5 years.

Among all students, past-7-day SHS exposures were: vehicle (21.4%, 5.56 million); home (21.7%, 5.64 million); home or vehicle (29.0%, 7.50 million); vehicle and home (14.0%, 3.63 million). By household tobacco-use status, home or vehicle SHS exposure was: tobacco-free households, 8.4%; households with combustible-only tobacco users, 59.8%; households with smokeless tobacco/e-cigarette-only users, 21.8%; and households with combined tobacco products usage, 73.9%. Where only the youth respondent but no other household member(s) used tobacco, the measure of association (vs. tobacco-free households) was ~two-fold higher for vehicle SHS exposures (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=6.09; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=4.93-7.54 than for home SHS exposures (AOR=3.16; 95%CI=2.35-4.25). Conversely, where only household member(s) but not the youth respondent used tobacco, the measure of association was over two-fold higher for home SHS exposures (AOR=22.15; 95%CI=19.12-25.67) than for vehicle SHS exposure (AOR=7.91; 95%CI=6.96-8.98). In summary, nearly one-third of U.S. youth (7.50 million) were exposed to either home or vehicle SHS. Among non-tobacco-using youth with tobacco-using household member(s), the home was a dominant SHS exposure source; among tobacco-using youth with non-tobacco-using household member(s), a vehicle was a dominant exposure source, possibly peers'. Smoke-free environments, including homes and cars, can reduce youth SHS exposure.","1096-0260:Agaku, Israel:Odani, Satomi:King, Brian A:Brian, Armour:Journal Article:United States:Prev Med. 2019 Jun 5. pii: S0091-7435(19)30207-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.06.003.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31175879","Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States of America.

There is now a large body of evidence on the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines in different settings, but these data have never been synthesised to obtain robust estimates of efficacy by duration of follow-up. Our aim is to estimate the efficacy of live oral rotavirus vaccines at each point during follow-up and by mortality stratum. METHODS: In our meta-regression study, we identified all randomised controlled trials of rotavirus vaccines published until April 4, 2018, using the results of a Cochrane systematic review, and cross checked these studies against those identified by another systematic review. We excluded trials that were based on special populations, trials without an infant schedule, and trials without clear reporting of numbers of enrolled infants and events in different periods of follow-up. For all reported periods of follow-up, we extracted the mean duration of follow-up (time since administration of the final dose of rotavirus vaccination), the number of enrolled infants, and case counts for rotavirus-positive severe gastroenteritis in both non-vaccinated and vaccinated groups. We used a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson meta-regression model to estimate the pooled cumulative vaccine efficacy (VE) and its waning with time for three mortality strata. We then converted these VE estimates into instantaneous VE (iVE). FINDINGS: In settings with low mortality (15 observations), iVE pooled for infant schedules of Rotarix and RotaTeq was 98% (95% credibility interval 93-100) 2 weeks following the final dose of vaccination and 94% (87-98) after 12 months. In medium-mortality settings (11 observations), equivalent estimates were 82% (74-92) after 2 weeks and 77% (67-84) after 12 months. In settings with high mortality (24 observations), there were five different vaccines with observation points for infant schedules. The pooled iVE was 66% (48-81) after 2 weeks of follow-up and 44% (27-59) after 12 months. INTERPRETATION: Rotavirus vaccine efficacy is lower and wanes more rapidly in high-mortality settings than in low-mortality settings, but the earlier peak age of disease in high-mortality settings means that live oral rotavirus vaccines are still likely to provide substantial benefit.

This analysis evaluates the impact of EM on the health of women with CFS by comparing selected health characteristics and laboratory parameters in women with CFS with and without EM (CFS+EM and CFS-only). Methods: This secondary analysis included all 36 women with CFS from a cross-sectional study of CFS in Wichita, KS, conducted between 2002 and 2003. The health characteristics and laboratory parameters of interest included functioning, fatigue, CFS-related symptoms, gynecologic history, routine laboratory parameters, inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, allostatic load, and sleep parameters (overnight polysomnography). We used parametric or non-parametric tests to compare group differences in the selected health characteristics and laboratory parameters. For examining the association between EM and variables of interest, logistic regression models were performed and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for the magnitude of associations. Statistical significance was set at 0.05 (two-sided). Results: The mean age of this study sample was 50.9 years. Of women with CFS, 36.1% reported having EM. Age and body mass index (BMI) did not differ between CFS+EM and CFS-only groups. When examining the impact of EM, compared to women with CFS-only, women with both CFS and EM were more likely to report chronic pelvic pain [OR = 9.00 (95% CI, 1.47-55.25)] and hysterectomy [OR = 10.3 (1.82-58.39)], had more CFS symptoms (6.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.3, p = 0.02), younger mean age at menopause onset (36.4 +/- 3.0 vs. 47.0 +/- 2.7 years, p = 0.03), higher mean number of obstructive apnea episodes per hour (20.3 vs. 4.4, p = 0.05) and reported more negative life events (15.8 vs. 4.4, p = 0.05). Other parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions: We found more than a third of women with CFS reported endometriosis as a comorbid condition. The endometriosis comorbidity was associated with chronic pelvic pain, earlier menopause, hysterectomy, and more CFS-related symptoms. However, endometriosis in women with CFS did not appear to further impact functioning, fatigue, inflammatory markers, or other laboratory parameters. Further investigations including younger women are warranted.","Boneva, Roumiana S:Lin, Jin-Mann S:Wieser, Friedrich:Nater, Urs M:Ditzen, Beate:Taylor, Robert N:Unger, Elizabeth R:Journal Article:Switzerland:Front Pediatr. 2019 May 21;7:195. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00195. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179251","Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.:Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.:Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.3389/fped.2019.00195"

Accurate population sodium intake estimates are essential for monitoring progress toward reduction, but data are limited on the amount of sodium consumed from discretionary salt. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare measured sodium intake from salt added at the table with that estimated according to the Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) methodology. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2014 Salt Sources Study, a cross-sectional convenience sample of 450 white, black, Asian, and Hispanic adults living in Alabama, Minnesota, and California. Sodium intake from foods and beverages was assessed for each participant through the use of 24-h dietary recalls. Estimated sodium intake from salt used at the table was assessed from self-reported frequency and estimated amounts from a previous study (HP 2020 methodology). Measured intake was assessed through the use of duplicate salt samples collected on recall days. RESULTS: Among all study participants, estimated and measured mean sodium intakes from salt added at the table were similar, with a nonsignificant difference of 8.9 mg/d (95% CI: -36.6, 54.4 mg/d). Among participants who were non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, had a bachelor's degree or higher education, lived in California or Minnesota, did not report hypertension, or had normal BMI, estimated mean sodium intake was 77-153 mg/d greater than measured intake (P < 0.05). The estimated mean sodium intake was 186-300 mg/d lower than measured intake among participants who were non-Hispanic black, had a high school degree or less, or reported hypertension (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The HP 2020 methodology for estimating sodium consumed from salt added at the table may be appropriate for the general US adult population; however, it underestimates intake in certain population subgroups, particularly non-Hispanic black, those with a high school degree or less, or those with self-reported hypertension.

While community health agents remain at the core of many birth and death reporting efforts, previous literature has not explored elements for their successful integration into CRVS efforts. Objective: To inform future efforts to improve CRVS systems, we conducted a systematic review of literature to understand and describe the design features, resulting data quality, and factors impacting the performance of community health agents involved in tracking vital events. Methods: We reviewed 393 articles; reviewers extracted key information from 58 articles meeting the eligibility criteria: collection of birth and/or death information outside of a clinic environment by a community agent. Reviewers recorded information in an Excel database on various program aspects, and results were summarized into key themes and topic areas. Results: The majority of articles described work in rural areas of Africa or South-East Asia. Nearly all articles (86%) cited some form of household visitation by community health agents. Only one article described a process in which vital events tracking activities were linked to official vital events registers. Other factors commonly described included program costs, relationship of community agents to community, and use of mobile devices. About 1/3 of articles reported quantitative information on performance and quality of vital events data tracked; various methods were described for measuring completeness of reporting, which varied greatly across articles. Conclusions: The multitude of articles on this topic attests to the availability of community health agents to track vital events. Creating a programmatic norm of integrating with CRVS systems the vital events information collected from existing community health programs has the potential to provide governments with information essential for public health decision-making.","1654-9880:Nichols, Erin K:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4917-1412:Ragunanthan, Nina W:Ragunanthan, Braveen:Gebrehiwet, Hermon:Kamara, Karim:Journal Article:United States:Glob Health Action. 2019;12(1):1597452. doi: 10.1080/16549716.2019.1597452.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179875","a National Center for Health Statistics , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Hyattsville , MD , USA.:b Department of Health and Human Services , United States Public Health Service , Washington, DC , USA.:c Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Magee-Womens Hospital , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.:d Department of Pediatrics , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , PA , USA.:e Health Sciences Program , Argosy University , Arlington , VA , USA.:f School of Health Professions , Shenandoah University , Winchester , VA , USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1080/16549716.2019.1597452"

We describe VL suppression in HIV-infected women at four to twenty-six weeks postpartum, factors associated with VL suppression and the impact of VL suppression levels on MTCT. METHODS: HIV-positive mothers at four to twenty-six weeks postpartum were enrolled in a nested cross-sectional study within the ""National Evaluation of Malawi's PMTCT Programme"" cohort study between October 2014 and May 2016. HIV-exposed infants received HIV-1 DNA testing and venous samples determined maternal VL, classified as unsuppressed (>1000 copies/mL), low-detectable (40 to 1000 copies/mL) or undetectable (<40 copies/mL). Socio-demographic and PMTCT indicators were collected. Suboptimal adherence was defined as self-reported >/=2 days missed ART in the month prior to visit. RESULTS: Of the 1274 women, 1191 (93.5%) knew their HIV status and 1154/1191 (96.9%) were on ART.

MTCT ratios among women on ART who had undetectable VL, low-detectable VL and unsuppressed VL were 0.9% (8/902; 95% CI 0.3 to 1.5), 7.0% (6/86; 95% CI 1.5 to 12.5) and 14.0% (19/136; 95% CI 8.1 to 20.0). Unsuppressed VL and low-detectable VL (vs. undetectable VL) increased the risk of MTCT 17-fold (aOR 17.4, 95% CI 7.4 to 41.1; p = 0.002) and ninefold (aOR 8.5, 95% CI 2.9 to 25.2; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Unsuppressed and low-detectable VL was strongly predictive of MTCT among women on ART and associated with suboptimal adherence. This urges further consideration of optimal VL monitoring and target levels to reach elimination of paediatric infection.","1758-2652:Landes, Megan:van Lettow, Monique:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0679-285X:Nkhoma, Ernest:Tippett Barr, Beth:Truwah, Zinenani:Shouten, Erik:Jahn, Andreas:Auld, Andrew:Kalua, Thokozani:van Oosterhout, Joep J:U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief:Journal Article:Switzerland:J Int AIDS Soc. 2019 Jun;22(6):e25290. doi: 10.1002/jia2.25290.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180186","Dignitas International, Zomba, Malawi.:Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.:Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.:Management Sciences for Health, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Harare, Zimbabwe.:Ministry of Health, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lilongwe, Malawi.:Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1002/jia2.25290"

Although PrEP is a private, user-controlled method that empowers women to protect themselves without relying on a partner's behavior, women's PrEP use has been extremely low. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify and summarize factors that may be affecting PrEP implementation for women in the United States. We conducted a search of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis Project database (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and PubMed to identify peer-reviewed studies published between January 2000 and April 2018 that reported U.S. women's or health care providers' PrEP knowledge or awareness, willingness to use or prescribe, attitudes, barriers and facilitators to use or prescription, or PrEP adherence and discontinuation influences. Thirty-nine studies (26 women, 13 providers) met the eligibility criteria. In these studies, 0%-33% of women had heard of PrEP. Between 51% and 97% of women were willing to try PrEP, and 60%-92% of providers were willing to prescribe PrEP to women. Implementation barriers included access, cost, stigma, and medical distrust. Three studies addressed adherence or discontinuation. PrEP knowledge is low among women and providers. However, women and providers generally have positive views when aware of PrEP, including a willingness to use or prescribe PrEP to women. Most of the implementation barriers highlighted in studies were social or structural factors (e.g., access). Additional studies are needed to address research gaps, including studies of PrEP adherence and discontinuation.","1931-843x:Bradley, Erin:Forsberg, Kaitlin:Betts, Joshua E:DeLuca, Julia B:Kamitami, Emiko:Porter, Sarah E:Sipe, Theresa Ann:Hoover, Karen W:Journal Article:United States:J Womens Health (Larchmt). 2019 Jun 10. doi: 10.1089/jwh.2018.7353.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180253","Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1089/jwh.2018.7353"

We assessed flavored product use among current tobacco users; and measured associations between flavored product use and dependence among US adults. METHODS: Data were from the 2014-2015 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, a cross-sectional household-based survey of U.S. adults >/=18 years (n=163,920). Current users of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were asked whether their usual product was menthol or came in any characterizing flavors. Proportions of flavored product users were computed nationally and by state and demographic characteristics. Tobacco dependence was assessed with two proxy measures: daily use and use </=30 minutes after waking. Associations between flavored product use and tobacco dependence were examined using logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and multi tobacco product use. RESULTS: An estimated 41.0% of current users of any tobacco product usually used a flavored product during 2014-2015. The proportion ranged from 22.5% (Maine) to 62.1% (D.C.). By product, the proportion ranged from 28.3% (cigars) to 87.2% (hookah). Flavored product use was associated with: daily tobacco product use among current e-cigarette users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.71), cigar smokers (AOR=1.42), and cigarette smokers (AOR=1.13); and tobacco product use </=30 minutes after waking among current cigar smokers (AOR=1.80), and cigarette smokers (AOR=1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Restricting sales of flavored tobacco products and implementation of proven population-level tobacco control interventions could help reduce tobacco product use among U.S. adults. IMPLICATIONS: During 2014-2015, flavored tobacco products were widely used by U.S. adults with variations across states and demographic characteristics. Use of flavored e-cigarettes, flavored cigars, and menthol cigarettes were associated with daily tobacco use: use of flavored cigars and menthol cigarettes were associated with tobacco use within 30 minutes after waking. These findings suggest associations between flavor use and increased tobacco dependence. Prohibiting sale of flavored products can reduce access to those products, and could help reduce tobacco dependence and promote cessation behaviors among current tobacco product users.","1469-994x:Odani, Satomi:Armour, Brian:Agaku, Israel T:Journal Article:England:Nicotine Tob Res. 2019 Jun 10. pii: 5513285. doi: 10.1093/ntr/ntz092.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180498","Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Northeast, Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/ntr/ntz092"

An industrial accident in 1973-1974 exposed Michigan residents to PBB through contaminated food. We examined whether this exposure to PBB had long-term effects on menstrual cycle function. METHODS: In 2004-06, we recruited reproductive-aged women in the Michigan PBB Registry who were not pregnant, lactating, or taking hormonal medications. Participants kept daily diaries and provided daily urine for up to 6 months. We assayed urine samples for estrone 3-glucuronide (E13G), pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (Pd3G), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). We fit linear mixed models among women aged 35-42 years to describe the relation between serum PBB levels and log-transformed, creatinine-adjusted daily endocrine levels among women who were premenarchal during the exposure incident in 1973-74 (n=70). RESULTS: We observed that high (>3.0 parts per billion (ppb)) and medium (>1.0-3.0 ppb) PBB exposure were associated with lower E13G levels across the menstrual cycle and lower FSH levels during the follicular phase, compared with low PBB exposure (</=1.0 ppb). High PBB exposure was also associated with lower Pd3G levels across the cycle compared with low PBB exposure, whereas Pd3G levels were similar in women with medium and low PBB exposure.

We assessed the laboratory-based performance of a rapid dual HIV/syphilis test using serum collected from patients enrolled in the Zimbabwe Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Etiology study. METHODS: Blood specimens were collected from patients presenting with STI syndromes in six, predominantly urban STI clinics in different regions of Zimbabwe. All specimens were tested at a central research laboratory using the Standard Diagnostics Bioline HIV/Syphilis Duo test. The treponemal syphilis component of the dual rapid test was compared to the Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) as a gold standard comparator, both alone or in combination with a non-treponemal test, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. The HIV component of the dual test was compared to a combination of HIV rapid tests conducted at the research laboratory following the Zimbabwe national HIV testing algorithm. RESULTS: Of 600 men and women enrolled in the study, 436 consented to serological syphilis and HIV testing and had specimens successfully tested by all assays. The treponemal component of the dual test had a sensitivity of 66.2% (95% C.I.: 55.2% - 77.2%) and a specificity of 96.4% (95% C.I.: 94.5% - 98.3%) when compared to TPHA; the sensitivity increased to 91.7% (95% C.I.: 82.6% - 99.9%) when both TPHA and RPR were positive. The HIV component of the dual test had a sensitivity of 99.4% (95% C.I.: 98.4% - 99.9%) and a specificity of 100% (95% C.I. 99.9% - 100%) when compared to the HIV testing algorithm. CONCLUSION: Laboratory performance of the SD Bioline HIV/Syphilis Duo test was high for the HIV component of the test. Sensitivity of the treponemal component was lower than reported from most laboratory-based evaluations in the literature. However, sensitivity of the test increased substantially among patients more likely to have active syphilis for which results of both standard treponemal and non-treponemal tests were positive.","1537-4521:Rietmeijer, Cornelis A:Mungati, More:Kilmarx, Peter H:Barr, Beth Tippett:Gonese, Elizabeth:Kularatne, Ranmini S:Lewis, David A:Klausner, Jeffrey D:Rodgers, Luanne:Handsfield, H Hunter:Journal Article:United States:Sex Transm Dis. 2019 Jun 7. doi: 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001022.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181033","Rietmeijer Consulting, LLC - Denver, CO, USA.:Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA.:Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Lesotho.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global Health and Tuberculosis, Harare, Zimbabwe.:Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Department of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Western Sydney Sexual Health Centre, Western Sydney Local Health District, Parramatta, New South Wales, Australia.:Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity & Westmead Clinical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.:Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Center for World Health, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.:Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.:University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/olq.0000000000001022"

The assay was validated for analytical sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and clinical performance with a geographically diverse collection of viral isolates and respiratory specimens in direct comparison with an established pan-HRSV rRT-PCR reference test. The assay was sensitive, reproducibly detecting as few as 5 to 10 copies/reaction of target RNA. The assay was specific, showing no amplification with a panel of 16 other common respiratory pathogens or predicted by in silico primer/probe analysis.

Distinct from GII.P16 polymerases detected since 2010, this novel GII.P16 was subsequently detected among GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.10 and GII.12 viruses, prompting an investigation on the unique characteristics of these viruses. Norovirus positive samples (n = 1807) were dual-typed, of which a subset (n = 124) was sequenced to yield near-complete genomes. CaliciNet and National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) records were matched to link outbreak characteristics and case outcomes to molecular data and GenBank was mined for contextualization. Recombination with the novel GII.P16 polymerase extended GII.4 Sydney predominance and increased the number of GII.2 outbreaks in the US. Introduction of the novel GII.P16 noroviruses occurred without unique amino acid changes in VP1, more severe case outcomes, or differences in affected population. However, unique changes were found among NS1/2, NS4 and VP2 proteins, which have immune antagonistic functions, and the RdRp. Multiple polymerase-capsid combinations were detected among GII viruses including 11 involving GII.P16. Molecular surveillance of protein sequences from norovirus genomes can inform the functional importance of amino acid changes in emerging recombinant viruses and aid in vaccine and antiviral formulation.","1999-4915:Barclay, Leslie:Cannon, Jennifer L:Wikswo, Mary E:Phillips, Annie R:Browne, Hannah:Montmayeur, Anna M:Tatusov, Roman L:Burke, Rachel M:Orcid: 0000-0002-5678-5826:Hall, Aron J:Vinje, Jan:Journal Article:Switzerland:Viruses. 2019 Jun 8;11(6). pii: v11060535. doi: 10.3390/v11060535.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181749","Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. gvm3@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. flb8@cdc.gov.:National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Inc., Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. flb8@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. ezq1@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. aphillips0619@gmail.com.:National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Inc., Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. aphillips0619@gmail.com.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. mqu6@cdc.gov.:Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA. mqu6@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. xda8@cdc.gov.:Cherokee Nation Assurance, Arlington, VA 22202, USA. xda8@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. yqy9@cdc.gov.:Cherokee Nation Assurance, Arlington, VA 22202, USA. yqy9@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. lxx8@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. esg3@cdc.gov.:Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. ahx8@cdc.gov.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.3390/v11060535"

RESULTS: We used a bead-based serological assay to measure lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aldolase (Aldo), and histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) levels in 196 children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria treated with effective antimalarials and followed for 28 to 42 days as part of therapeutic efficacy studies in Angola. Compared to pre-treatment levels, antigen concentrations two days after treatment declined by 99.7% for LDH, 96.3% for Aldo, and 54.6% for HRP2. After Day 2, assuming a first-order kinetics clearance model, half-lives of the antigens were 1.8 days (95% CI: 1.5-2.3) for LDH, 3.2 days (95% CI: 3.0-3.4) for Aldo, and 4.8 days (95% CI: 4.7-4.9) for HRP2.

Using the combined databases of 6 integrated health care organizations, we examined HZ incidence in children over a 12-year period in the varicella vaccine era. METHODS: This study included children aged 0 through 17 years from 2003 through 2014. Using electronic medical records, we identified HZ cases through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code 053. We calculated HZ incidence rates per 100 000 person years of health plan membership for all children and among children who were vaccinated versus unvaccinated. We calculated rates for the 12-year period and examined temporal trends. Among children who were vaccinated, we compared HZ rates by month and year of age at vaccination. RESULTS: The study included 6 372 067 children with >/=1 month of health plan membership. For the 12-year period, the crude HZ incidence rate for all subjects was 74 per 100 000 person years, and the rate among children who were vaccinated was 38 per 100 000 person years, which was 78% lower than that among children who were unvaccinated (170 per 100 000 person years; P < .0001). Overall HZ incidence declined by 72% (P < .0001) from 2003 through 2014. Annual rates in children who were vaccinated were consistently lower than in children who were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: With this population-based study, we confirm the decline in pediatric HZ incidence and the significantly lower incidence among children who are vaccinated, reinforcing the benefit of routine varicella vaccination to prevent pediatric HZ.","1098-4275:Weinmann, Sheila:Naleway, Allison L:Koppolu, Padma:Baxter, Roger:Belongia, Edward A:Hambidge, Simon J:Irving, Stephanie A:Jackson, Michael L:Klein, Nicola P:Lewin, Bruno:Liles, Elizabeth:Marin, Mona:Smith, Ning:Weintraub, Eric:Chun, Colleen:Journal Article:United States:Pediatrics. 2019 Jun 10. pii: peds.2018-2917. doi: 10.1542/peds.2018-2917.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182552","Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon; sheila.weinmann@kpchr.org.:Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon.:Vaccine Study Center, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.:Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, Wisconsin.:Denver Health, Denver, Colorado.:Kaiser Permanente Washington, Seattle, Washington.:Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; and.:Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (Emeritus), Department of Pediatrics, Northwest Permanente, Portland, Oregon.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1542/peds.2018-2917"

METHODS: We conducted respondent-driven sampling surveys among FSW and MSM/TGW in Port Moresby, PNG from June to October 2016. All participants spoke English or Tok Pisin and were aged >12 years. FSW had to be born female and sell/exchange sex with a male in the past 6 months. MSM/TGW had to be born male and have oral/anal sex with another male-born person in the past 6 months.

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of organized outreach using fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) compared with usual care. METHODS: Patients aged 50-75 years eligible for CRC screening from eight participating primary care safety-net clinics were randomized to outreach intervention with usual care versus usual care alone. The intervention included a mailed postcard and call, followed by a mailed FIT kit, and a reminder phone call if the FIT kit was not returned. The primary outcome was screening participation at one year and a microcosting analysis of the outreach activities with embedded long-term cost-effectiveness of outreach. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: 5,386 patients were randomized to the intervention group and 5,434 to usual care. FIT screening was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (57.9% vs. 37.4%, P < 0.001; difference 20.5%, 95% CI 18.6-22.4%). In the intervention group, FIT completion rate was higher in patients who had previously completed a FIT versus those who had not (71.9% vs. 35.7%, P < 0.001). There was evidence of effect modification of the intervention by race/ethnicity, marital status, language, and clinic. Outreach cost approximately $23/patient and $112/additional patient screened. Projecting long-term outcomes, outreach was estimated to cost $9,200/quality-adjusted life-year gained vs. usual care. CONCLUSION: Population-based management with organized FIT outreach statistically significantly increased CRC screening and was cost-effective in a safety-net system.

METHODS: Programs were classified into three delivery structures: (1) centralized, (2) decentralized, and (3) mixed. Centralized programs offer clinical services in satellite offices, but all other program activities are performed centrally. Decentralized programs contract with other entities to fully manage and provide screening and diagnostic services and other program activities. Programs with mixed service delivery structures have both centralized and decentralized features. Programmatic costs were averaged over a 3 year period (2006-2007, 2008-2009, and 2009-2010). Effectiveness was defined in terms of the average number of women served over the 3 years. We report costs per woman served by program activity and delivery structure and incremental cost effectiveness by program structure and by breast/cervical services. RESULTS: Average costs per woman served were lowest for mixed program structures (breast = $225, cervical = $216) compared to decentralized (breast = cervical = $276) and centralized program structures (breast = $259, cervical = $251). Compared with decentralized programs, for each additional woman served, centralized programs saved costs of $281 (breast) and $284 (cervical). Compared with decentralized programs, for each additional woman served, mixed programs added an additional $109 cost for breast but saved $1,777 for cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed program structures were associated with the lowest screening and diagnostic costs per woman served and had generally favorable incremental costs relative to the other program structures.","1573-7225:Trogdon, Justin G:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5484-7870:Ekwueme, Donatus U:Subramanian, Sujha:Miller, Jacqueline W:Wong, Faye L:Contract No. 200-2002-00575 TO 06/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:200-2008-27958 TO 9/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:Journal Article:Netherlands:Cancer Causes Control. 2019 Jun 11. pii: 10.1007/s10552-019-01190-2. doi: 10.1007/s10552-019-01190-2.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187351","Department of Health Policy and Management, Gillings School of Global Public Health and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 135 Dauer Dr., CB-7411, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA. justintrogdon@unc.edu.:Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA.:RTI International, Waltham, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1007/s10552-019-01190-2"

METHODS: We estimated the cost, absenteeism, and years of life lost (YLL) of medically and non-medically attended influenza-associated mild and severe respiratory, circulatory and non-respiratory/non-circulatory illness in South Africa during 2013-2015 using a modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) worksheet based tool for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza. Additionally, we restricted the analysis to influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI; subsets of all-respiratory illnesses) as suggested in the WHO manual. RESULTS: The estimated mean annual cost of influenza-associated illness was $270.5 million, of which $111.3 million (41%) were government-incurred costs, 40.7 million (15%) were out-of-pocket expenses, and $118.4 million (44%) were indirect costs. The cost of influenza-associated medically attended mild illness ($107.9 million) was 2.3 times higher than that of severe illness ($47.1 million). Influenza-associated respiratory illness costs ($251.4 million) accounted for 93% of the total cost. Estimated absenteeism and YLL were 13.2 million days and 304 867 years, respectively. Among patients with influenza-associated WHO-defined ILI or SARI, the costs ($95.3 million), absenteeism (4.5 million days), and YLL (65 697) were 35%, 34%, and 21% of the total economic and health burden of influenza. CONCLUSION: The economic burden of influenza-associated illness was substantial from both a government and a societal perspective. Models that limit estimates to those obtained from patients with WHO-defined ILI or SARI substantially underestimated the total economic and health burden of influenza-associated illness.","1750-2659:Tempia, Stefano:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4395-347X:Moyes, Jocelyn:Cohen, Adam L:Walaza, Sibongile:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7588-2480:Edoka, Ijeoma:McMorrow, Meredith L:Treurnicht, Florette K:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0853-8011:Hellferscee, Orienka:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9246-8927:Wolter, Nicole:von Gottberg, Anne:Nguweneza, Athermon:McAnerney, Johanna M:Dawood, Halima:Variava, Ebrahim:Cohen, Cheryl:201996000/World Health Organization/International:5U51IP000155/National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases:Journal Article:England:Influenza Other Respir Viruses. 2019 Jun 11. doi: 10.1111/irv.12650.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187609","Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:Influenza Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pretoria, South Africa.:Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, National Institute for Communicable Diseases of the National Health Laboratory Service, Johannesburg, South Africa.:MassGenics, Duluth, Georgia.:Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Expanded Programme on Immunization, Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.:Priority Cost Effectiveness Lessons for System Strengthening South Africa, South Africa Medical Research Council, Wits Center for Health Economic and Decision Science, School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Department of Medicine, Greys Hospital, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.:Caprisa, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.:Department of Medicine, Klerksdorp-Tshepong Hospital Complex, Klerksdorp, South Africa.:Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.:Perinatal HIV Research Unit, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1111/irv.12650"

We conducted this study to better understand asthma-related healthcare use and to examine potential asthma triggers. Methods: We characterized asthma-related healthcare use in 2013 by demographics, region, and date using outpatient, hospital, and emergency department (ED) insurance claims with a primary diagnostic ICD-9-CM code of 493.XX. We examined environmental asthma triggers, including outdoor allergens (i.e., mold and pollen), particulate pollution, and influenza-like illness. Analyses included descriptive statistics and Poisson time-series regression. Results: During 2013, there were 550,655 medical asthma claims reported to the Puerto Rico Healthcare Utilization database, representing 148 asthma claims/1,000 persons; 71% of asthma claims were outpatient visits, 19% were hospitalizations, and 10% were ED visits. Females (63%), children aged </=9 years (77% among children), and adults aged >/=45 years (80% among adults) had the majority of asthma claims. Among health regions, Caguas had the highest asthma claim-rate at 142/1,000 persons (overall health region claim-rate = 108). Environmental exposures varied across the year and demonstrated seasonal patterns. Metro health region regression models showed positive associations between increases in mold and particulate matter <10 microns in diameter (PM10) and outpatient asthma claims. Conclusions: This study provides information about patterns of asthma-related healthcare use across Puerto Rico. Increases in mold and PM10 were associated with increases in asthma claims. Targeting educational interventions on exposure awareness and reduction techniques, especially to persons with higher asthma-related healthcare use, can support asthma control activities in public health and clinical settings.","1532-4303:Lewis, Lillianne M:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0957-2190:Mirabelli, Maria C:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3540-0085:Beavers, Suzanne F:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1592-3644:Kennedy, Caitlin M:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5117-0005:Shriber, Jennifer:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7145-8463:Stearns, Dorothy:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0000-6424:Morales Gonzalez, Jonathan J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1724-0487:Santiago, Marimer Soto:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8783-0554:Felix, Ibis Montalvo:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9186-3503:Ruiz-Serrano, Krystel:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-0572:Dirlikov, Emilio:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4631-2643:Lozier, Matthew J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1000-151X:Sircar, Kanta:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2819-2035:Flanders, W Dana:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4069-3262:Rivera-Garcia, Brenda:Irizarry-Ramos, Jessica:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1350-6185:Bolanos-Rosero, Benjamin:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4340-7006:Journal Article:England:J Asthma. 2019 Jun 12:1-12. doi: 10.1080/02770903.2019.1612907.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187658","a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Asthma and Community Health Branch, National Center for Environmental Health , Atlanta , GA , USA.:b Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Epidemic Intelligence Service , Atlanta , GA , USA.:c Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lead Poisoning Prevention and Environmental Health Tracking Branch, National Center for Environmental Health , Atlanta , GA , USA.:d Puerto Rico Department of Health, Auxiliary Secretariat of Planning and Development , San Juan , Puerto Rico , USA.:e Puerto Rico Department of Health , Office of Epidemiology and Investigation , San Juan , Puerto Rico , USA.:f Puerto Rico Department of Health, Puerto Rico Asthma Program, Division for the Prevention and Control of Chronic Diseases , San Juan , Puerto Rico , USA.:g Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dengue Branch , National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases , Atlanta , GA , USA.:h Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health , Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.:i Department of Microbiology, Medical Sciences Campus , University of Puerto Rico , San Juan , Puerto Rico , USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1080/02770903.2019.1612907"

This UL has been employed in the decision-making process used by more than 80 countries to establish programs to fortify staple foods with folic acid to prevent neural tube birth defects. Some have claimed that this UL is flawed and has become an obstacle to the wider adoption of neural tube defect prevention programs and have called for re-evaluation of the scientific validity of this UL. Case reports cannot establish causality, but they can reveal patterns in the timing of the onset and treatment of patients with pernicious anemia. These patterns can be compared with secular trends of usual medical practice for the treatment of pernicious anemia and with the changes in usage of folic acid preparations, including recommended therapeutic dosage and precautions for its usage surrounding the synthesis of folic acid in 1945 and vitamin B12 in 1948. Folic acid package inserts, early editions of hematology textbooks, and international expert reports provide valuable historical information. The recommended therapeutic daily dosage for folic acid of 5-20 mg was unchanged from 1946 through to 1971. The likely cause of the neurological problems encountered is the development of vitamin B12 neuropathy when pernicious anemia was treated with high-dosage folic acid before vitamin B12 was widely available in the early 1950s. Thus, the historical record does not provide compelling evidence that folic acid can potentially cause neurologic complications among those with low vitamin B12 status and lends support for reconsidering the basis for the UL of folic acid.","1938-3207:Berry, Robert J:Journal Article:United States:Am J Clin Nutr. 2019 Jun 12. pii: 5514146. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/nqz089.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187858","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Division of Congenital and Developmental Disorders, Atlanta, GA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/ajcn/nqz089"

To inform prevention efforts, this study identified correlates of IP homicide among male suicide decedents with known IP problems. METHODS: We examined IP homicide correlates among male suicide decedents aged 18+ years who had known IP problems using 2003-2015 National Violent Death Reporting System data. Prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for demographic, incident, and circumstance variables. IP homicide-suicide narratives were examined to identify additional prevention opportunities. RESULTS: An estimated 1,504 (5.0%) of 30,259 male suicide decedents who had IP problems killed their partner. IP homicide-suicide perpetration was positively correlated with suicide by firearm and precipitating civil legal problems but negatively correlated with mental health/substance abuse treatment. An estimated 33.7% of IP homicide-suicides occurred during a breakup; 21.9% of IP homicide-suicide perpetrators had domestic violence histories.

We describe the prevalence of MSM who reported any STI test and an extragenital STI test in the past 12 months (p12m) in the United States. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2017 American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS), an annual cross-sectional behavioral internet survey of MSM in the United States. We examined the prevalence of MSM who reported any STI test and an extragenital STI test in the p12m and compared the prevalence across demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. RESULTS: Of 10, 049 sexually-active MSM who participated in AMIS 2017, 42% reported any STI test in the p12m and 16% reported an extragenital (rectal or pharyngeal) STI test in the p12m.

In temperate climate countries, including the U.S., influenza activity peaks during the winter months. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons in the U.S. aged 6 months and older, and among those at increased risk for influenza-related complications in other parts of the world (e.g. young children, elderly). Observational studies have reported effectiveness of influenza vaccination to reduce the risks of severe disease requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. A diagnosis of influenza should be considered in critically ill patients admitted with complications such as exacerbation of underlying chronic comorbidities, community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory failure during influenza season. Molecular tests are recommended for influenza testing of respiratory specimens in hospitalized patients. Antigen detection assays are not recommended in critically ill patients because of lower sensitivity; negative results of these tests should not be used to make clinical decisions, and respiratory specimens should be tested for influenza by molecular assays. Because critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract disease may have cleared influenza virus in the upper respiratory tract, but have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, an endotracheal aspirate (preferentially) or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen (if collected for other diagnostic purposes) should be tested by molecular assay for detection of influenza viruses.Observational studies have reported that antiviral treatment of critically ill adult influenza patients with a neuraminidase inhibitor is associated with survival benefit. Since earlier initiation of antiviral treatment is associated with the greatest clinical benefit, standard-dose oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily in adults) for enteric administration is recommended as soon as possible as it is well absorbed in critically ill patients. Based upon observational data that suggest harms, adjunctive corticosteroid treatment is currently not recommended for children or adults hospitalized with influenza, including critically ill patients, unless clinically indicated for another reason, such as treatment of asthma or COPD exacerbation, or septic shock.

This study identified differential gene regulation in human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) grown either in monoculture or in coculture with human microvascular endothelial cells following exposure of the SAECs to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). SAEC genes that either changed their regulation direction from upregulated in monoculture to downregulated in coculture (or vice versa) or had a more than a two-fold changed in the same regulation direction were identified. Genes that changed regulation direction were most often involved in the processes of cellular growth and proliferation and cellular immune response and inflammation. Genes that had a more than a two-fold change in regulation in the same direction were most often involved in the inflammatory response. The direction and fold-change of this differential gene regulation suggests that toxicity testing in monoculture may exaggerate cellular responses to MWCNTs, and coculture of cells may provide a more in-depth assessment of toxicological responses.","2214-7500:Snyder-Talkington, Brandi N:Dong, Chunlin:Castranova, Vincent:Qian, Yong:Guo, Nancy L:Journal Article:Ireland:Toxicol Rep. 2019 May 28;6:482-488. doi: 10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.05.010. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194188","West Virginia University Cancer Institute, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, 26506, United States.:Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, 26506, United States.:National Institute for Occupational and Environmental Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Rd., Morgantown, WV, 26505, United States.:Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, 26506, United States.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.05.010"

The basic principle of the method, the analysis, and interpretation of the data are explained as is its major strengths and limitations. We also describe the benefits and possibilities of the WGS technology to the food industry throughout the farm-to-fork continuum and the prospects of metagenomic sequencing applied directly to the sample specimen with or without pre-enrichment culture.","1556-7125:Brown, Eric:Dessai, Uday:McGarry, Sherri:Gerner-Smidt, Peter:Journal Article:United States:Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2019 Jun 13. doi: 10.1089/fpd.2019.2662.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194586","1 Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, College Park, Maryland.:2 Office of Public Health Science, Food Safety and Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, District of Columbia.:3 Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1089/fpd.2019.2662"

METHODS: We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data (2008, 2011, and 2014) to study trends in the number and partner type composition (main/casual) of male sex partners among US MSM. Changes over time were assessed in Poisson regression models with the link function tailored to the count and binary outcomes. RESULTS: The mean total number of partners in the past year increased, while the mean number of main partners remained stable. The percentage of MSM with both main and casual partners increased, and we observed a shift from having >/=1 main and 0 casual partners to having >/=1 main and >/=2 casual partners. Condomless anal sex in the past year increased regardless of partner composition. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest casual partnering among MSM has increased in recent years, including among those with >/=1 main partners.

We assessed HIV viral suppression and continuity in care after intervention withdrawal to determine the durability of FI on these outcomes. SETTING: A total of 37 HIV test and 39 HIV care sites in the Bronx, New York, and Washington, DC, participated in the study. METHODS: Laboratory data reported to the US National HIV Surveillance System were used to determine site-level viral suppression and continuity in care outcomes. Postintervention effects were assessed for the 3 quarters after discontinuation of FI. Generalized estimation equations were used to compare FI and SOC site-level outcomes after intervention withdrawal. RESULTS: After FI withdrawal, a trend remained for an increase in viral suppression by 2.7% (-0.3%, 5.6%, P = 0.076) at FI versus SOC sites, decreasing from the 3.8% increase noted during implementation of the intervention. The significant increase in continuity in care during the FI intervention was sustained after intervention with 7.5% (P = 0.007) higher continuity in care at FI versus SOC sites. CONCLUSIONS: After the withdrawal of FI, findings at the 9-months postintervention withdrawal from this large study showed evidence of durable effects of FI on continuity in care, with trend for continued higher viral suppression.

Before 1960, dogs were a common reservoir of rabies in the United States; however, increasingly, species of wildlife (e.g., bats, raccoons) are the main reservoirs. This report characterizes human rabies deaths, summarizes trends in rabies mortality, and highlights current rabies risks in the United States. METHODS: Rabies trends in the United States during 1938-2018 were analyzed using national rabies surveillance data. Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for 2006-2014 were used to estimate the number of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) visits per 100,000 persons during 2017-2018. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' average sales price data were used to estimate PEP costs. RESULTS: From 1960 to 2018, a total of 125 human rabies cases were reported in the United States; 36 (28%) were attributed to dog bites during international travel. Among the 89 infections acquired in the United States, 62 (70%) were attributed to bats. In 2018, approximately 55,000 persons sought PEP after contact with a potentially rabid animal. CONCLUSIONS AND COMMENTS: In the United States, wildlife rabies, especially in bats, continues to pose a risk to humans. Travelers also might be exposed to canine rabies in countries where the disease is still present; increased awareness of rabies while traveling abroad is needed. Vaccinating pets, avoiding contact with wildlife, and seeking medical care if one is bitten or scratched by an animal are the most effective ways to prevent rabies. Understanding the need for timely administration of PEP to prevent death is critical.","1545-861x:Pieracci, Emily G:Pearson, Christine M:Wallace, Ryan M:Blanton, Jesse D:Whitehouse, Erin R:Ma, Xiaoyue:Stauffer, Kendra:Chipman, Richard B:Olson, Victoria:Journal Article:United States:MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2019 Jun 14;68(23):524-528. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6823e1.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194721",,,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.15585/mmwr.mm6823e1"

Trends in urban and rural areas, across demographic subgroups, and among subgroups within urban and rural areas have not been reported. CDC analyzed 2008-2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data to examine trends in the age-standardized prevalence of meeting physical activity guidelines among adults aged >/=18 years living in urban and rural areas. Among urban and rural residents, prevalence increased from 19.4% to 25.3% and from 13.3% to 19.6%, respectively. Nationally, all demographic subgroups and regions experienced increases over this period; increases for several groups were not consistent year-to-year. Among urban residents, the prevalence was higher during 2016-2017 than during 2008-2009 for all demographic subgroups and regions. During the same period, prevalence was higher across all rural-dwelling subgroups except Hispanics, adults with a college education, and those living in the South U.S. Census region. Urban and rural communities can implement evidence-based approaches, including improved community design, improved access to indoor and outdoor recreation facilities, social support programs, and community-wide campaigns to make physical activity the safe and easy choice for persons of all ages and abilities (2-4).

ACBC isolates from patients' blood, transfused platelet residuals, and two environmental samples were closely related by whole genome sequencing. S. saprophyticus isolates from two patients' blood, three transfused platelet residuals, and one hospital environmental sample formed two whole genome sequencing clusters. This whole genome sequencing analysis indicated a potential common source of bacterial contamination; investigation into the contamination source continues. All platelet donations were collected using apheresis cell separator machines and collection sets from the same manufacturer; two of three collection sets were from the same lot. One implicated platelet unit had been treated with pathogen-inactivation technology, and two had tested negative with a rapid bacterial detection device after negative primary culture. Because platelets are usually stored at room temperature, bacteria in contaminated platelet units can proliferate to clinically relevant levels by the time of transfusion.

The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable Communities (Call to Action) presents goals and supporting strategies to promote walking. We assessed the presence and prioritization of 4 community supports for walking related to the goals of the Call to Action from the perspective of US adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional web-based survey. SETTING: US adults. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4043 respondents. MEASURES: SummerStyles 2016 survey assessing the reported presence and prioritization of 4 community supports for walking. ANALYSIS: Estimated prevalence of the presence of supports overall and by demographic characteristics, and prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios of their prioritization. RESULTS: The most commonly reported community supports for walking were access to walkable locations (46.5%) and safe streets (29.2%), followed by walking groups (12.9%) and promotional campaigns (9.6%). Access to walkable locations (60.0%) and safe streets (50.6%) were most often prioritized by respondents, followed by promotional campaigns (23.6%) and walking groups (18.8%). Many differences in prioritization by demographic characteristics remained significant after adjusting for presence and other demographic characteristics, such as increased prioritization of all supports with older age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Presence and prioritization of community supports for walking varied widely by type of support and by demographic characteristics.

Although nano-metals have been shown to induce greater lung injury and inflammation than their larger metal counterparts, their size-related effects on the immune system and allergic disease remain largely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly concerning since metals are historically recognized as common inducers of allergic contact dermatitis, occupational asthma, and allergic adjuvancy. The investigation into the potential for adverse immune effects following exposure to metal nanomaterials is becoming an area of scientific interest since these characteristically lightweight materials are easily aerosolized and inhaled, and their small size may allow for penetration of the skin, which may promote unique size-specific immune effects with implications for allergic disease. Additionally, alterations in physicochemical properties of metals in the nano-scale greatly influence their interactions with components of biological systems, potentially leading to implications for inducing or exacerbating allergic disease. Although some research has been directed toward addressing these concerns, many aspects of metal nanomaterial-induced immune effects remain unclear. Overall, more scientific knowledge exists in regards to the potential for metal nanomaterials to exacerbate allergic disease than to their potential to induce allergic disease. Furthermore, effects of metal nanomaterial exposure on respiratory allergy have been more thoroughly-characterized than their potential influence on dermal allergy. Current knowledge regarding metal nanomaterials and their potential to induce/exacerbate dermal and respiratory allergy are summarized in this review.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the pneumococcal lineages behind the predominant serotypes, the mechanism of serotype replacement in disease, as well as the major pneumococcal lineages contributing to invasive pneumococcal disease in the post-vaccine era and their antibiotic resistant traits. METHODS: We whole-genome sequenced 3233 invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from laboratory-based surveillance programmes in Hong Kong (n=78), Israel (n=701), Malawi (n=226), South Africa (n=1351), The Gambia (n=203), and the USA (n=674). The genomes represented pneumococci from before and after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introductions and were from children younger than 3 years. We identified predominant serotypes by prevalence and their major contributing lineages in each country, and assessed any serotype replacement by comparing the incidence rate between the pre-PCV and PCV periods for Israel, South Africa, and the USA. We defined the status of a lineage as vaccine-type GPSC (>/=50% 13-valent PCV [PCV13] serotypes) or non-vaccine-type GPSC (>50% non-PCV13 serotypes) on the basis of its initial serotype composition detected in the earliest vaccine period to measure their individual contribution toward serotype replacement in each country. Major pneumococcal lineages in the PCV period were identified by pooled incidence rate using a random effects model. FINDINGS: The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. The five most prevalent serotypes in the PCV13 period varied between countries, with only serotypes 5, 12F, 15B/C, 19A, 33F, and 35B/D common to two or more countries. These serotypes were associated with more than one lineage, except for serotype 5 (GPSC8). Serotype replacement was mainly mediated by expansion of non-vaccine serotypes within vaccine-type GPSCs and, to a lesser extent, by increases in non-vaccine-type GPSCs. A globally spreading lineage, GPSC3, expressing invasive serotypes 8 in South Africa and 33F in the USA and Israel, was the most common lineage causing non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease in the PCV13 period. We observed that same prevalent non-vaccine serotypes could be associated with distinctive lineages in different countries, which exhibited dissimilar antibiotic resistance profiles. In non-vaccine serotype isolates, we detected significant increases in the prevalence of resistance to penicillin (52 [21%] of 249 vs 169 [29%] of 575, p=0.0016) and erythromycin (three [1%] of 249 vs 65 [11%] of 575, p=0.0031) in the PCV13 period compared with the pre-PCV period. INTERPRETATION: Globally spreading lineages expressing invasive serotypes have an important role in serotype replacement, and emerging non-vaccine serotypes associated with different pneumococcal lineages in different countries might be explained by local antibiotic-selective pressures. Continued genomic surveillance of the dynamics of the pneumococcal population with increased geographical representation in the post-vaccine period will generate further knowledge for optimising future vaccine design.

Using data from the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study, we evaluated the role of RBV and increased DAA treatment duration among patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in routine clinical care. Multivariable analysis of data from 4133 patients receiving any of the following: sofosbuvir (SOF); daclatasvir +SOF; grazoprevir +elbasvir; paritaprevir/ ritonavir +ombitasvir; simeprevir +SOF; and SOF +ledipasvir; SOF +velpatasvir +/-voxilaprevir; and glecaprevir+pibrentasvir-all with/ without RBV. Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to adjust for treatment-selection bias. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined by undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after end of therapy. The overall SVR rate was 95%. Mean treatment duration was 12+/-4.5 weeks. The final model included treatment duration and diabetes, as well as the interaction of RBV with previous treatment status (treatment naive, interferon treatment failure [TF], or previous DAA TF), cirrhosis status, and HCV genotype (GT). Each one month increment of treatment duration increased odds of SVR by 99% (aOR=1.99). Diabetes, previous DAA TF, and decompensated cirrhosis significantly reduced odds of SVR. RBV significantly increased the likelihood of SVR among patients with decompensated cirrhosis (aOR=5.05), previous DAA treatment failure (aOR=5.43), and GT3 (aOR=13.28). Among RBV-free regimens, patients with GT3 were less likely to achieve SVR than those with GT1 or 2 (aOR 0.07). Diabetes, decompensated cirrhosis, and prior DAA TF independently reduced the likelihood of SVR. Longer treatment duration increased likelihood of SVR. RBV increased likelihood of SVR among patients with GT3, previous DAA TF, or decompensated cirrhosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Fruit and vegetable prescription programs improve access to and affordability of health-supporting foods for adults, but their effect on dietary behavior among children is not known. The objective of this study was to describe the extent to which exposure to a fruit and vegetable prescription program was associated with changes in consumption among participants aged 2 to 18. METHODS: We used data from a modified National Cancer Institute screener to calculate fruit and vegetable intake among 883 children who were overweight or had obesity and participated in a 4- to 6-month fruit and vegetable prescription program at federally qualified health centers during 4 years (2012-2015). Secondary analyses in 2017 included paired t tests to compare change in fruit and vegetable consumption (cups/day) between first and last visits and multivariable linear regressions, including propensity dose-adjusted models, to model this change as a function of sociodemographic and program-specific covariates, such as number of clinical visits and value of prescription redemption. RESULTS: We found a dose propensity-adjusted increase of 0.32 cups (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.45 cups) for each additional visit while holding constant the predicted number of visits and site. An equal portion of the change-score increase was attributed to vegetable consumption and fruit consumption (beta = 0.16 for each). CONCLUSION: Fruit and vegetable prescription programs in clinical settings may increase fruit and vegetable consumption among children in low-income households. Future research should use a comparison group and consider including qualitative analysis of site-specific barriers and facilitators to success.","1545-1151:Ridberg, Ronit A:Bell, Janice F:Merritt, Kathryn E:Harris, Diane M:Young, Heather M:Tancredi, Daniel J:Journal Article:United States:Prev Chronic Dis. 2019 Jun 13;16:E73. doi: 10.5888/pcd16.180555.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198165","Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, University of California, Davis, 2450 48th St, Sacramento, CA 95817.

This Treat All policy was based on evidence that ART initiation early in HIV infection as opposed to waiting for the CD4 count to decline to certain levels (e.g., <500 cells/mm(3), per previous guidelines), was associated with reduced morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission (2-4). Further, approximately half of persons enrolled in non-ART care that included monitoring for HIV disease progression (i.e., in pre-ART care) were lost to follow-up before becoming ART-eligible (5). India, the country with the third largest number of persons with HIV infection in the world (2.1 million), adopted the Treat All policy on April 28, 2017. This report describes implementation of Treat All during May 2017-June 2018, by India's National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and partners, by facilitating ART initiation among persons previously in pre-ART care at 46 ART centers supported by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)* in six districts in the states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Partners supported these 46 ART centers in identifying and attempting to contact persons who were enrolled in pre-ART care during January 2014-April 2017, and educating those reached about Treat All.

Combining these complementary methods, we use disease importation and transmission data to improve the accuracy and precision of a priori ecological risk estimates. We demonstrate this approach by estimating the spatiotemporal risks of Zika virus transmission throughout Texas, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our estimates are, on average, 80% lower than published ecological estimates-with only six of 254 Texas counties deemed capable of sustaining a Zika epidemic-and they are consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017. Importantly our method provides a framework for model comparison, as our mechanistic understanding of arbovirus transmission continues to improve.

We describe the impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction on admissions for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in primarily low-income and middle-income countries, using 9 years of data from the WHO-coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance Network (GRSN). METHODS: Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2016, children younger than 5 years of age who were admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis were prospectively enrolled in GRSN sites. We included sites that enrolled children and collected stool specimens monthly and tested at least 100 specimens annually in the impact analysis, with a separate analysis taking into account site continuity. We compared proportions of acute gastroenteritis cases positive for rotavirus in the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine periods and calculated mean proportion changes for WHO regions, with 95% CIs; these findings were then compared with interrupted time series analyses. We did further sensitivity analyses to account for rotavirus vaccination coverage levels and sites that collected specimens for at least 11 months per year and tested at least 80 specimens per year. We also analysed the age distribution of rotavirus-positive cases before and after vaccine introduction. FINDINGS: 403 140 children younger than 5 years of age admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis from 349 sites in 82 countries were enrolled over the study period, of whom 132 736 (32.9%) were positive for rotavirus. We included 305 789 children from 198 sites in 69 countries in the impact analysis. In countries that had not introduced rotavirus vaccine in their national immunisation programmes, rotavirus was detected in 38.0% (95% CI 4.8-73.4) of admissions for acute gastroenteritis annually whereas in those that have introduced the vaccine, rotavirus was detected in 23.0% (0.7-57.7) of admissions for acute gastroenteritis, showing a 39.6% (35.4-43.8) relative decline following introduction. Interrupted time series analyses confirmed these findings. Reductions by WHO regions ranged from 26.4% (15.0-37.8) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to 55.2% (43.0-67.4) in the European Region and were sustained in nine countries (contributing up to 31 sites) for 6-10 years. The age distribution of children with rotavirus gastroenteritis shifted towards older children after rotavirus vaccine introduction. INTERPRETATION: A significant and sustained reduction in the proportion of hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis due to rotavirus was seen among children younger than 5 years in GRSN sites following rotavirus vaccine introduction. These findings highlight the need to incorporate rotavirus vaccines into immunisation programmes in countries that have not yet introduced them and underline the importance of high-quality surveillance.

We investigated whether influenza vaccination of children would protect them and their household members in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: We did a cluster-randomised, blinded, controlled study in three villages in India. Clusters were defined as households (ie, dwellings that shared a courtyard), and children aged 6 months to 10 years were eligible for vaccination as and when they became age-eligible throughout the study. Households were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-based system to intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or a control of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the beginning of the study; vaccination occurred once a year for 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza in a vaccinated child with febrile acute respiratory illness, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, children who received at least one dose of vaccine, were under surveillance, and had not an influenza infection within 15 days of last vaccine dose). The secondary outcome for indirect effectiveness (surveillance study) was febrile acute respiratory illness in an unvaccinated household member of a vaccine study participant. Data from each year (year 1: November, 2009, to October, 2010; year 2: October, 2010, to October, 2011; and year 3: October, 2011, to May, 2012) were analysed separately. Safety was analysed among all participants who were vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00934245. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 2009, to May 1, 2012, we enrolled 3208 households, of which 1959 had vaccine-eligible children. 1010 households were assigned to IIV3 and 949 households were assigned to IPV. In 3 years, we vaccinated 4345 children (2132 with IIV3 and 2213 with IPV) from 1868 households (968 with IIV3 and 900 with IPV) with 10 813 unvaccinated household contacts. In year 1, influenza virus was detected in 151 (10%) of 1572 IIV3 recipients and 206 (13%) of 1633 of IPV recipients (total IIV3 vaccine efficacy 25.6% [95% CI 6.8-40.6]; p=0.010). In year 2, 105 (6%) of 1705 IIV3 recipients and 182 (10%) of 1814 IPV recipients had influenza (vaccine efficacy 41.0% [24.1-54.1]; p<0.0001). In year 3, 20 (1%) of 1670 IIV3 recipients and 81 (5%) of 1786 IPV recipients had influenza (vaccine efficacy 74.2% [57.8-84.3]; p<0.0001). In year 1, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 14.5% (-20.4 to 39.3). In year 2, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H3N2) was 64.5% (48.5-75.5). Total vaccine efficacy against influenza B was 32.5% (11.3-48.6) in year 1, 4.9% (-38.9 to 34.9) in year 2, and 76.5% (59.4-86.4) in year 3. Indirect vaccine effectiveness was statistically significant only in year 3 (38.1% [7.4-58.6], p=0.0197) when influenza was detected in 39 (1%) of 4323 IIV3-allocated and 60 (1%) of 4121 IPV-allocated household unvaccinated individuals. In the IIV3 group, 225 (12%) of 1632 children in year 1, 375 (22%) of 1718 in year 2, and 209 (12%) of 1673 in year 3 had an adverse reaction (compared with 216 [13%] of 1730, 380 [21%] of 1825, and 235 [13%] of 1796, respectively, in the IPV group). The most common reactions in both groups were fever and tenderness at site. No vaccine-related deaths occurred in either group. INTERPRETATION: IIV3 provided variable direct and indirect protection against influenza infection. Indirect protection was significant during the year of highest direct protection and should be considered when quantifying the effect of vaccination programmes.

One in five prescription opioid deaths also involve alcohol. Drinkers who misuse prescription opioids (i.e., use without a prescription or use only for the experience or feeling it causes) are at a heightened risk of overdose. However, little is known about the relationship between drinking patterns and prescription opioid misuse. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 160,812 individuals (aged >/=12 years) who responded to questions about prescription opioid misuse and alcohol consumption in the 2012, 2013, or 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (analyzed in 2017-2018). The prevalence of self-reported past-30-days prescription opioid misuse was assessed by sociodemographic characteristics, other substance use (i.e., cigarettes, marijuana), and drinking patterns. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate AORs. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2014, 1.6% (95% CI=1.5, 1.7) of all individuals aged >/=12 years (estimated 4.2 million) and 3.5% (95% CI=3.3, 3.8) of binge drinkers (estimated 2.2 million) reported prescription opioid misuse. Prescription opioid misuse was more common among binge drinkers than among nondrinkers (AOR=1.7, 95% CI=1.5, 1.9). Overall, the prevalence of prescription opioid misuse increased significantly with binge drinking frequency (p-value<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the 4.2 million people who misused prescription opioids during 2012-2014 were binge drinkers, and binge drinkers had nearly twice the odds of misusing prescription opioids, compared with nondrinkers. Widespread use of evidence-based strategies for preventing binge drinking might reduce opioid misuse and overdoses involving alcohol.","1873-2607:Esser, Marissa B:Guy, Gery P Jr:Zhang, Kun:Brewer, Robert D:Journal Article:Netherlands:Am J Prev Med. 2019 Jun 7. pii: S0749-3797(19)30157-6. doi: 10.1016/j.amepre.2019.02.025.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200998","Division of Population Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.

IgG4-based ELISA using recombinant proteins, yielded sensitivities of 53% for rOVOC10469 and 78% for rOVOC3261, while specificity for each was >99%. Moreover, the newly-identified biomarkers detected some (but not all) of the mf-positive samples not detected by OV-16. The new antigens in combination with OV-16, increased the sensitivity for patent infections to 94%, demonstrating the benefits of adding a complementary antigen to OV-16-based serology. The kinetics of appearance of these IgG4 responses based on experimentally infected non-human primates indicated that they were patency driven. Of note, the IgG4 responses to both OVOC10469 and OVOC3261 (as well as to OV-16) drop significantly (p<0.05) following successful treatment for onchocerciasis. A prototype of a lateral flow rapid assay was developed and tested, showing an overall 94% sensitivity.

We aimed to investigate if routine cervical cancer screening results-namely high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cytohistopathology-predict anal HPV16 infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and, hence, anal cancer. METHODS: We did a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane library for studies of cervical determinants of anal HPV and HSIL published up to Aug 31, 2018. We centrally reanalysed individual-level data from 13 427 women with paired cervical and anal samples from 36 studies. We compared anal high-risk HPV prevalence by HIV status, cervical high-risk HPV, cervical cytohistopathology, age, and their combinations, using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs. Among 3255 women with anal cytohistopathology results, PRs were similarly calculated for all anal HSIL and HPV16-positive anal HSIL. FINDINGS: Cervical and anal HPV infections were highly correlated. In HIV-negative women, anal HPV16 prevalence was 41% (447/1097) in cervical HPV16-positive versus 2% (214/8663) in cervical HPV16-negative women (PR 16.5, 95% CI 14.2-19.2, p<0.0001); these values were 46% (125/273) versus 11% (272/2588) in HIV-positive women (4.4, 3.7-5.3, p<0.0001). Anal HPV16 was also associated with cervical cytohistopathology, with a prevalence of 44% [101/228] for cervical cancer in HIV-negative women (PR vs normal cytology 14.1, 11.1-17.9, p<0.0001). Anal HSIL was associated with cervical high-risk HPV, both in HIV-negative women (from 2% [11/527] in cervical high-risk HPV-negative women up to 24% [33/138] in cervical HPV16-positive women; PR 12.9, 95% CI 6.7-24.8, p<0.0001) and HIV-positive women (from 8% [84/1094] to 17% [31/186]; 2.3, 1.6-3.4, p<0.0001). Anal HSIL was also associated with cervical cytohistopathology, both in HIV-negative women (from 1% [5/498] in normal cytology up to 22% [59/273] in cervical HSIL; PR 23.1, 9.4-57.0, p<0.0001) and HIV-positive women (from 7% [105/1421] to 25% [25/101]; 3.6, 2.5-5.3, p<0.0001). Prevalence of HPV16-positive anal HSIL was 23-25% in cervical HPV16-positive women older than 45 years (5/20 in HIV-negative women, 12/52 in HIV-positive women). INTERPRETATION: HPV-based cervical cancer screening programmes might help to stratify anal cancer risk, irrespective of HIV status. For targeted secondary anal cancer prevention in high-risk groups, HIV-negative women with cervical HPV16, especially those older than 45 years, have a similar anal cancer risk profile to that of HIV-positive women.

This study describes validation of the limiting-antigen (LAg) Avidity enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in a cross-sectional national survey, conducted in Swaziland, comparing it to prospective follow up incidence. As part of the Swaziland HIV-1 Incidence Measurement Survey (SHIMS), 18,172 individuals underwent counselling and HIV rapid testing in a household-based, population survey conducted from December 2010 to June 2011. Plasma samples from HIV-positive persons were classified as recent infections using an incidence testing algorithm with LAg-Avidity EIA (ODn 1.5) followed by viral load (VL >/=1,000 copies/mL). All HIV-seronegative samples were tested for acute HIV-1 infection by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) pooling. HIV-seronegative individuals who consented to follow-up, were retested approximately 6 months later to detect observed HIV-1 seroconversion. HIV-1 incidence estimates based on LAg+VL and NAAT were calculated using assay-specific parameters and were compared with prospective incidence estimate. A total of 5,803 (31.9%) of 18,172 survey participants tested HIV-seropositive; of these 5683 (97.9%) were further tested with LAg+VL algorithm. The weighted annualized incidence from the longitudinal cohort study was 2.4% [95% CI 2.0, 2.7]. Based on cross-sectional testing of HIV-positives with LAg+VL algorithm, overall weighted annualized HIV-1 incidence was 2.5% [2.0, 3.0], while NAAT-based incidence was of 2.6%. In addition, LAg-based incidence in men (1.8%; 1.2-2.5) and women (3.2%; 2.4-3.9) were similar to estimates based on observed incidence (men=1.7%, women=3.1%). Changes in HIV-1 incidence with age in men and women further validate plausibility of the algorithm. These results demonstrate that the LAg EIA, in a serial algorithm with VL, is a cost-effective tool to estimate HIV-1 incidence in cross-sectional surveys.","1931-8405:Duong Pottinger, Yen:Dobbs, Trudy:Mavengere, Yvonne:Manjengwa, Julius:Rottinghaus, Erin K:Saito, Suzue:Bock, Naomi:Philip, Neena:Justman, Jessica:Bicego, George:Nkengasong, John N:Parekh, Bharat:Journal Article:United States:AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2019 Jun 17. doi: 10.1089/AID.2018.0284.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31204867","CDC, Division of Global HIV & TB, Atlanta, Georgia, United States ; yp2411@cumc.columbia.edu.:CDC, Division of Global HIV & TB, Atlanta, Georgia, United States ; tld3@cdc.gov.:ICAP, Coumbia University, New York, New York, United States ; ym2347@cumc.columbia.edu.:ICAP, Coumbia University, New York, New York, United States ; jm3686@cumc.columbia.edu.:CDC, DGHA, International Laboratory Branch, Atlanta, Georgia, United States ; isa0@cdc.gov.:ICAP, Coumbia University, New York, New York, United States ; ss1117@cumc.columbia.edu.:CDC, Division of Global HIV & TB, Atlanta, Georgia, United States ; neb2@cdc.gov.:ICAP, Coumbia University, New York, New York, United States ; nmp6@cumc.columbia.edu.:Columbia University, International Center for AIDS Care and T, New York, New York, United States ; jj2158@cumc.columbia.edu.:CDC, Division of Global HIV & TB, Atlanta, Georgia, United States ; gpb4@cdc.gov.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, International Laboratory Branch , Build#1, Room# 3062 , 1600 Clifton Road , Atlanta, Georgia, United States , 30333 ; jcn5@cdc.gov.:CDC, Division of Global HIV & TB, Atlanta, Georgia, United States ; bsp1@cdc.gov.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1089/aid.2018.0284"

We describe steps taken to launch the 2-year program, its outcomes and lessons learned. Methods: State and local health departments submitted proposals for a TEFA to strengthen local capacity in four key public health preparedness areas: 1) epidemiology and surveillance, 2) health systems preparedness, 3) health communications, and 4) incident management. TEFAs and jurisdictions were selected through a competitive process. Descriptions of TEFA activities in their quarterly reports were reviewed to select illustrative examples for each preparedness area. Results: Eleven TEFAs began in the fall of 2015, assigned to 7 states, 2 cities, 1 county and the District of Columbia. TEFAs strengthened epidemiologic capacity, investigating routine and major outbreaks in addition to implementing event-based and syndromic surveillance systems. They supported improvements in health communications, strengthened healthcare coalitions, and enhanced collaboration between local epidemiology and emergency preparedness units. Several TEFAs deployed to United States territories for the 2016 Zika Outbreak response. Conclusion: TEFAs made important contributions to their jurisdictions' preparedness. We believe the TEFA model can be a significant component of a national strategy for surging state and local capacity in future high-consequence events.","Caceres, Victor M:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9052-1840:Goodell, Jessica:Shaffner, Julie:Turner, Alezandria:Jacobs-Wingo, Jasmine:Koirala, Samir:Molina, Monica:Leidig, Robynn:Celaya, Martin:McGinnis Pilote, Kara:Garrett-Cherry, Tiana:Carney, Jhetari:Johnson, Kym:Daley, W Randolph:Journal Article:England:SAGE Open Med. 2019 May 16;7:2050312119850726. doi: 10.1177/2050312119850726. eCollection 2019.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205697","Division of State and Local Readiness, Center for Preparedness and Response, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1177/2050312119850726"

Reliance on low sensitivity rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) to guide antiviral prescribing has been reported. We describe antiviral prescribing practices among primary care providers from a large surveillance network in the United States. Methods: From 2009-2016, a network of 36 to 68 outpatient clinics per year collected respiratory specimens and clinical data for patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). Specimens were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We used multivariable logistic regression to assess factors influencing antiviral prescribing. Results: Among 13 540 patients with ILI, 2766 (20%) were prescribed antivirals. In age groups recommended to receive empiric antiviral treatment for suspected influenza, 11% of children <2 years and 23% of adults >/=65 years received a prescription. Among 3681 patients with a positive PCR test for influenza, 40% tested negative by RIDT. In multivariable analysis, prescription receipt was strongly associated with a positive RIDT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 12, 95% CI 11-14) and symptom onset </=2 days before visit (aOR 4.3, 95% CI 3.8-4.9). Antiviral prescribing was also more frequent among pediatric and private family practice clinics compared with community health centers (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.2, and 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, respectively). Conclusion: Primary care providers were more likely to prescribe antivirals to patients with a positive RIDT, but antivirals were prescribed infrequently even to patients in high-risk age groups. Understanding patient and provider characteristics associated with antiviral prescribing is important for communicating treatment recommendations.","Fowlkes, Ashley L:Steffens, Andrea:Reed, Carrie:Temte, Jonathan L:Campbell, Angela P:Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project Working Group:Journal Article:United States:Open Forum Infect Dis. 2019 Apr 26;6(6):ofz192. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofz192. eCollection 2019 Jun.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205973","Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.:University of Wisconsin-Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1093/ofid/ofz192"

Search terms were developed to identify judicial opinions related to emergency preparedness, response, and recovery activities. Using the Thomson Reuters Westlaw legal database, searches were conducted to collect judicial opinions related to disasters that occurred in the United States between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2015. An electronic form was used for data abstraction. Cases that did not directly involve emergency response, preparedness, or recovery activities were excluded. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics. We identified 215 cases for data abstraction. Many of the cases stemmed from preparedness, response, and recovery activities related to hurricanes (57.7%) and terrorist attacks (16.7%). The most prevalent emergency response activities at issue were disaster mitigation (29.3%), disaster clean-up (21.9%), a defendant's duty to plan (14.4%), evacuation (12.6%), and conditions of incarceration (12.1%). Although it can be anticipated that litigation will arise out of all phases of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, policymakers can anticipate that the most litigation will result from pre-event mitigation and post-event recovery activities, and allocate resources accordingly.","2326-5108:McCourt, Alexander D:Sunshine, Gregory:Rutkow, Lainie:Journal Article:United States:Health Secur. 2019 May/Jun;17(3):240-247. doi: 10.1089/hs.2018.0118.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206320","Alexander D.

Identifying factors associated with teen pregnancy for young men is essential to developing relevant and effective programming. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies with findings on factors associated with pregnancies/birth specific to young men. We searched Scopus, OVID, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2015. We reviewed 1750 articles for inclusion of studies conducted in the United States with a sample size greater than 200 that assessed the effect of factors on teen pregnancy/birth using multivariate, male-specific analyses. Two coders abstracted 48 articles (having established 80% reliability with 10% of the articles). We grouped study variables into factors and used a matrix to summarize findings for each factor. During analysis, 29 articles were excluded for a final sample of 19 articles, each describing a separate study. RESULTS: Study settings included households, healthcare organizations, schools, neighborhoods, and correctional facilities. Factors showing associations with teen pregnancy/birth included: experiencing childhood abuse; engaging in serious or repeated delinquent behaviors; substance abuse; having a teen parent; serious family disruption; not living with either parent; and Hispanic ethnicity. No studies assessed knowledge and attitudes about contraceptive methods, or access and use of clinical services; and few assessed relationship factors (n=4) or gender and power (n=1).

We examined changes in concordance between ICD-CM codes and clinical diagnoses before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM in the United States (October 1, 2015), and determined if there were systematic variations in concordance by patient and hospital characteristics. Methods- We included Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program patient discharges from 2014 to 2017. Concordance between ICD-CM codes and the clinical diagnosis documented by the physician (assumed as accurate) was calculated for each diagnosis category: ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Results- In total, 314 857 patient records were included in the analysis (n=280 hospitals), 55.9% of which were obtained after the transition to ICD-10-CM. While concordance was generally high, a small, and temporary decline occurred from the last calendar quarter of ICD-9-CM (average unadjusted concordance =92.8%) to the first quarter of ICD-10-CM use (91.0%). Concordance differed by diagnosis category and was generally highest for ischemic stroke. In the analysis of ICD-10-CM records, disagreements often occurred between ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack records and between subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage records. Compared with the smallest hospitals (</=200 beds), larger hospitals had significantly higher odds of concordance (ischemic stroke adjusted odds ratio for >/=400 beds, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-1.9). Conclusions- This study identified a small and transient decline in concordance between ICD-CM codes and stroke clinical diagnoses during the coding transition, indicating no substantial impact on the overall identification of stroke patients. Researchers and policymakers should remain aware of potential changes in ICD-CM code accuracy over time, which may affect disease surveillance. Systematic variations in the accuracy of codes by hospital and patient characteristics have implications for quality-of-care studies and hospital comparative assessments.","1524-4628:Chang, Tiffany E:Tong, Xin:George, Mary G:Coleman King, Sallyann M:Yin, Xiaoping:O'Brien, Suzanne:Ibrahim, Ghada:Liskay, Alice:Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program team:Wiltz, Jennifer L:Journal Article:United States:Stroke. 2019 Jun 18:STROKEAHA118024092. doi: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.024092.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208302","From the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA (T.E.C., X.T., M.G.G., S.M.C.K., X.Y., J.L.W.).:IHRC, Inc, Atlanta, GA (T.E.C., X.Y.).:United States Public Health Service (S.M.C.K., J.L.W.).:Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Lansing (S.O., G.I.).:MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH (A.L.).",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1161/strokeaha.118.024092"

On 30 October 2015, 3 students at Mukuju School, Tororo District, Uganda, died soon after eating chapatti (locally-made flat bread) from the same food stand. Ministry of Health investigated to identify the cause and recommend prevention measures. METHODS: We defined a case as onset during 30-31 October 2015 in a resident of Mukuju Town of >/=1 of the following symptoms: excessive saliva, profuse sweating, dizziness, low blood pressure, constricted pupils or loss of consciousness. We reviewed medical/police records and interviewed survivors, healthcare workers, and police officers. We collected samples of implicated food for toxicological analysis. Autopsies were performed on decedents to identify the cause of death. RESULTS: We identified 7 cases with 3 deaths (case-fatality ratio = 43%). Clinical manifestations included acute onset of confusion (100%), constricted pupils (43%), excessive saliva (43%), and low blood pressure (43%). All 7 cases had onset from 16:00-18:00 h on 30 October, with a point-source exposure pattern. Of the 7 cases, 86% (6/7) were men; the mean age was 24 (range: 20-32) years. The 3 decedents each ate a whole chapatti while the other 4 cases ate half or less. Autopsy findings of the 3 decedents indicated organophosphate poisoning. Toxicological analysis found high levels of malathion in leftover foods (266 mg/L in dough and 258 mg/L in chapatti) and malaoxon (a highly toxic malathion derivative) in decedents' postmortem specimens (mean levels of 19 mg/L in the blood and 22 mg/L in the gastric contents). There was a delay of 4 h before the patients received appropriate treatment. Police investigations revealed that flour used to make the chapatti was intentionally contaminated with an organophosphate pesticide. CONCLUSION: This fatal outbreak of organophosphate poisoning was associated with consumption of roadside-vended chapatti made of flour contaminated with pesticide. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and prepared to treat it quickly. Street vendors should carefully consider the source of their ingredients. An in-depth surveillance review of such poisonings in Uganda would guide policymakers in reducing access by criminals and accidental exposures for the public.","1471-2458:Kwesiga, Benon:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0400-8635:Ario, Alex R:Bulage, Lilian:Harris, Julie:Zhu, Bao-Ping:GH001353-01/President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cooperative Agreement:Journal Article:England:BMC Public Health. 2019 Jun 17;19(1):767. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-7143-0.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208431","Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program, Ministry of Health, P.O.

Low vaccination coverage in previous years is the biggest contributing factor to the increase in cases. The Ukraine reported the majority of cases, but France, Georgia, Greece, Italy, the Russian Federation, and Serbia also reported high case counts. Europe is the most common travel destination worldwide and is widely perceived as being without substantial infectious disease risks. For this reason, travelers may not consider the relevance of a pretravel health consultation, including vaccination, in their predeparture plans. Measles is highly contagious, and the record number of measles cases in the WHO European Region not only puts unvaccinated and inadequately vaccinated travelers at risk but also increases the risk for nontraveling US residents who come into close contact with returned travelers who are ill. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage US travelers to be aware of measles virus transmission in Europe and receive all recommended vaccinations, including for measles, before traveling abroad. Health care providers must maintain a high degree of suspicion for measles among travelers returning from Europe or people with close contact with international travelers who present with a febrile rash illness. The current WHO European Region outbreak should serve to remind health care providers to stay current with the epidemiology of highly transmissible diseases, such as measles, through media, WHO, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports and encourage measles vaccination for international travelers.","1098-4275:Angelo, Kristina M:Gastanaduy, Paul A:Walker, Allison T:Patel, Manisha:Reef, Susan:Lee, C Virginia:Nemhauser, Jeffrey:Journal Article:United States:Pediatrics. 2019 Jun 17. pii: peds.2019-0414. doi: 10.1542/peds.2019-0414.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31209161","Travelers' Health Branch, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, kangelo@cdc.gov.:Viral Vaccine Preventable Diseases Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, and.:Travelers' Health Branch, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.:Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Diseases Surveillance Branch, Global Immunization Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1542/peds.2019-0414"

However, there are limited guidelines and data on the availability and quality of newborn care in conflict settings. In 2016, an interagency collaboration developed the Newborn Health in Humanitarian Settings Field Guide- Interim version (Field Guide). In this study, we sought to understand the baseline availability and quality of essential newborn care in Bossaso, Somalia as part of an investigation to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of the Field Guide in improving newborn care in humanitarian settings. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at four purposely selected health facilities serving internally displaced persons affected by conflict in Bossaso. Essential newborn care practice and patient experience with childbirth care received at the facilities were assessed via observation of clinical practice during childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and through postnatal interviews of mothers. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were employed to summarize and examine variation by health facility. Results: Of the 332 pregnant women approached, 253 (76.2%) consented and were enrolled. 97.2% (95% CI: 94.4, 98.9) had livebirths and 2.8% (95% CI: 1.1, 5.6) had stillbirths. The early newborn mortality was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.3, 4.8). Nearly all [95.7%, (95% CI: 92.4, 97.8)] births were attended by skilled health worker. Similarly, 98.0% (95% CI: 95.3, 99.3) of newborns received immediate drying, and 99.2% (95% CI: 97.1, 99.9) had delayed bathing. Few [8.6%, (95% CI: 5.4, 12.9)] received immediate skin-to-skin contact and the practice varied significantly by facility (p < 0.001). One-third of newborns [30.1%, (95% CI: 24.4, 36.2)] received early initiation of breastfeeding and there was significant variation by facility (p < 0.001). While almost all [99.2%, (95% CI: 97.2, 100)] service providers wore gloves while attending births, handwashing was not as common [20.2%, (95% CI: 15.4, 25.6)] and varied by facility (p < 0.001). Nearly all [92%, (95% CI: 86.9, 95.5)] mothers were either very happy or happy with the childbirth care received at the facility. Conclusion: Essential newborn care interventions were not universally available. Quality of care varied by health facility and type of intervention.

In 2013, the CAP was awarded a 5-year cooperative agreement grant from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the effectiveness of LPGs. OBJECTIVE.-: To assess the awareness and adoption of 2 CAP LPGs: immunohistochemical (IHC) assay validation and initial workup of acute leukemia. DESIGN.-: Baseline surveys for each LPG were conducted in 2010 and 2015, respectively. To measure the adoption of guideline recommendations and inform future updates, a follow-up study consisting of surveys, telephone interviews, and focus group sessions was conducted in laboratories that indicated they perform IHC testing. A follow-up study for the acute leukemia LPG is planned. RESULTS.-: For the IHC Validation LPG, a total of 1624 survey responses, 40 telephone interviews, and discussions with 5 focus group participants were analyzed. The response rate for the aforementioned 3 modalities was 46%, 13%, and 3%, respectively. All modalities indicated most respondents were aware of the LPG and had adopted most or all of its recommendations. Respondents expressed needs for continued communication, increased specificity, and more prescriptive recommendations when the guideline is updated. CONCLUSIONS.-: While data-driven development of evidence-based LPGs requires significant resources, active data collection to identify gaps and assess adoption contributes to improved laboratory testing practices in support of patient care. The CAP identified sustainable modalities to track metrics and developed multiple tools that should improve guideline development, adoption, and implementation. Of these modalities, written or electronic surveys were the most logistically feasible and had the highest response rate.","1543-2165:Goldsmith, Jeffrey D:Fitzgibbons, Patrick L:Fatheree, Lisa A:Astles, J Rex:Nowak, Jan A:Souers, Rhona J:Volmar, Keith E:Nakhleh, Raouf E:Journal Article:United States:Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2019 Jun 18. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2018-0276-CP.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211613","From the Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts (Dr Goldsmith); the Department of Pathology, St. Jude Medical Center, Fullerton, California (Dr Fitzgibbons); Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center for Evidence-Based Guidelines (Ms Fatheree) and Statistics/Biostatistics (Ms Souers), College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois; Division of Laboratory Systems, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia (Dr Astles); the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York (Dr Nowak); the Department of Pathology, Rex Pathology Associates, Raleigh, North Carolina (Dr Volmar); and the Department of Pathology, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville (Dr Nakhleh).",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.5858/arpa.2018-0276-CP"

DESIGN: The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is a complex sample survey of adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States. METHODS: We used MMP data collected during 6/2015-5/2016 to calculate the weighted prevalence of GAD symptoms among PWH (N = 3654) and prevalence ratios with predicted marginal means to evaluate significant differences between groups. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of GAD symptoms among PWH was 19%. GAD symptoms were associated with significantly lower antiretroviral therapy prescription and adherence, medical HIV care engagement, and sustained viral suppression. Persons with GAD symptoms were over 3 times as likely to have an unmet need for mental health services (23% vs. 7%) and had significantly more emergency room visits and hospitalizations than those without these symptoms. GAD symptoms were associated with significantly higher prevalence of condomless sex while not sustainably virally suppressed with a person not known to be taking preexposure prophylaxis (9% vs. 6%). CONCLUSIONS: GAD symptom prevalence among PWH was considerably higher than among the U.S. general adult population, indicating an excess burden of anxiety among PWH. Outcomes along the HIV care continuum were poorer, and risk for HIV transmission was higher, among persons with symptoms. Incorporating routine screening for GAD in HIV clinical settings may help improve health outcomes, reduce HIV transmission, and save healthcare costs.","1473-5571:Beer, Linda:Tie, Yunfeng:Padilla, Mabel:Shouse, R Luke:Medical Monitoring Project:Journal Article:England:AIDS. 2019 Jun 17. doi: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000002286.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211718","Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd.

After 1 d exposures for >/=2 h, acclimated adults had a noticeable increase in cold tolerance compared with nonacclimated adults for both tested species. Nonacclimated pupae of T. confusum were equally susceptible to cold compared with acclimated pupae at short exposures to low temperatures. Exposure of nonacclimated life stages of T. confusum, at -10 degrees C for 1 d gave 0% survival. Similarly, almost all (99.6%) nonacclimated individuals of O. surinamensis died at -10 degrees C. At 0 degrees C, nonacclimated larvae were more cold tolerant than acclimated larvae, but this trend was reversed when larvae were exposed to -5 degrees C.

Methods and Results We examined cardiovascular risk factors ( CVRF s) and arterial parameters in 1809 youth with T1DM. Demographics, anthropometrics, blood pressure, and laboratory data were collected at T1DM onset and 5 years later. Pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were collected with tonometry. ANOVA or chi-square tests were used to test for differences in measures of arterial parameters by CVRF . Area under the curve of CVRF s was entered in general linear models to explore determinants of accelerate vascular aging. Participants at the time of arterial measurement were 17.6+/-4.5 years old, 50% female, 76% non-Hispanic white, and duration of T1DM was 7.8+/-1.9 years. Glycemic control was poor (glycated hemoglobin, 9.1+/-1.8%). All arterial parameters were higher in participants with glycated hemoglobin >/=9% and pulse wave velocity was higher with lower insulin sensitivity or longer duration of diabetes mellitus. Differences in arterial parameters were found by sex, age, and presence of obesity, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. In multivariable models, higher glycated hemoglobin, lower insulin sensitivity, body mass index, blood pressure, and lipid areas under the curve were associated with accelerated vascular aging. Conclusions In young people with T1DM, persistent poor glycemic control and higher levels of traditional CVRF s are independently associated with arterial aging. Improving glycemic control and interventions to lower CVRF s may prevent future cardiovascular events in young individuals with T1DM.","2047-9980:Urbina, Elaine M:Isom, Scott:Bell, Ronny A:Bowlby, Deborah A:D'Agostino, Ralph Jr:Daniels, Stephen R:Dolan, Lawrence M:Imperatore, Giuseppina:Marcovina, Santica M:Merchant, Anwar T:Reynolds, Kristi:Shah, Amy S:Wadwa, R Paul:Dabelea, Dana:SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study Group:Journal Article:England:J Am Heart Assoc. 2019 Jul 2;8(13):e010150. doi: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010150.

We evaluate the comparative effectiveness of an antibiotic stewardship intervention adapted for acute care ambulatory settings (adapted intervention) to a stewardship intervention that additionally incorporates behavioral nudges (enhanced intervention) in reducing inappropriate prescriptions. METHODS: This study was a pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial conducted in three academic health systems comprising five adult and pediatric EDs and four UCCs. Randomization of the nine sites was stratified by health system; all providers at each site received either the adapted or the enhanced intervention. The main outcome was the proportion of antibiotic-inappropriate ARI diagnosis visits that received an outpatient antibiotic prescription by individual providers. We estimated a hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression model comparing visits during the influenza season for 2016 to 2017 (baseline) and 2017 to 2018 (intervention). RESULTS: There were 44,820 ARI visits among 292 providers across all nine cluster sites. Antibiotic prescribing for ARI visits dropped from 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5% to 7.9%) to 2.4% (95% CI = 1.3% to 3.4%) during the study period. We found a significant reduction in inappropriate prescribing after adjusting for health-system and provider-level effects from 2.2% (95% CI = 1.0% to 3.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI = 0.7% to 2.3%) with an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.54 to 0.82). Difference-in-differences between the two interventions was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Implementation of antibiotic stewardship for ARI is feasible and effective in the ED and UCC settings. More intensive behavioral nudging methods were not more effective in high-performance settings.","1553-2712:Yadav, Kabir:ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1092-9935:Meeker, Daniella:Mistry, Rakesh D:Doctor, Jason N:Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E:Fleischman, Ross J:Gaona, Samuel D:Stahmer, Aubyn:May, Larissa:R21-AG057400/National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Aging:200-2016-91939/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:Journal Article:United States:Acad Emerg Med. 2019 Jun 19. doi: 10.1111/acem.13690.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215721","Department of Emergency Medicine, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.:Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Torrance, CA.:Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.:Department of Pediatrics, Section of Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital of Colorado, Aurora, CO.:Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.:Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, CA.:Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, CA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1111/acem.13690"

The humoral response was dominated by GII.4-specific antibodies that blocked ancestral strains or by antibodies that bound to divergent genotypes and did not block viral-entry-ligand interactions. However, one antibody, A1431, showed broad blockade toward tested GII.4 strains and neutralized the pandemic GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney strain.

A number of respiratory specimen types may be used, including swabs, brush, aspirate and wash, and specimens may be collected from numerous sites, including anterior and posterior nasopharynx, oropharynx and nares. Traditionally, respiratory specimens from the nasopharynx were considered to have highest sensitivity for viral detection. However, as molecular assays such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have increased the sensitivity of viral detection from respiratory specimens, the use of less invasive and easier to obtain specimens has increased for the detection of influenza. This review presents and evaluates the sensitivities of respiratory specimen methods used in epidemiologic studies that used RT-PCR to detect influenza virus in respiratory specimens from ill patients. This literature review suggested that a combination of two less invasive swabbing methods, such as nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, had about the same sensitivity as nasopharyngeal specimens for influenza detection by RT-PCR. By combining two less invasive collection methods, it may be possible to reduce barriers to enrollment without compromising influenza detection sensitivity.","1098-660x:Spencer, Sarah:Thompson, Mark G:Flannery, Brendan:Fry, Alicia:Journal Article:Review:United States:J Clin Microbiol. 2019 Jun 19. pii: JCM.00027-19. doi: 10.1128/JCM.00027-19.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217267","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Influenza Division, Atlanta, GA vmf5@cdc.gov.:Atlanta Research and Education Foundation, Atlanta, GA.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Influenza Division, Atlanta, GA.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1128/jcm.00027-19"

We sought to determine characteristics of children with bacteremic pneumonia using data from a large prospective study with systematic blood culturing. METHODS: Children <18 years hospitalized with pneumonia and enrolled in the multicenter Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community study between January 2010 and June 2012 were eligible. Bivariate comparisons were used to identify factors associated with bacteremia. Associations between bacteremia and clinical outcomes were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards regression for length of stay and logistic regression for ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation or shock. RESULTS: Blood cultures were obtained in 2143 (91%) of 2358 children; 46 (2.2%) had bacteremia. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 23, 50%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6, 13%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 4, 9%). Characteristics associated with bacteremia included male sex, parapneumonic effusion, lack of chest indrawing or wheezing, and no previous receipt of antibiotics. Children with bacteremia had longer lengths of stay (median: 5.8 vs 2.8 days; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.79 [0.73-0.86]) and increased odds of ICU admission (43% vs 21%; adjusted odds ratio: 5.21 [3.82-6.84]) and invasive mechanical ventilation or shock (30% vs 8%; adjusted odds ratio: 5.28 [2.41-11.57]). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia was uncommonly detected in this large multicenter cohort of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia but was associated with severe disease. S pneumoniae was detected most often.

METHODS: AD administration and use of exposure controls (EC) such as gloves, gowns, and needleless systems were self-reported at baseline among 2649 participants of the Nurses' Health Study 3, who were actively attempting pregnancy. Every 6 months thereafter, the nurses reported the current duration of their pregnancy attempt. Multivariable accelerated failure time models were used to estimate time ratios (TR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, race, body mass index, smoking, marital status, hours of work, and other occupational risk factors. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) age and BMI at baseline were 30.7 years (4.7) and 26.0 kg/m(2) (6.4). Forty-one percent of nurses reported ever administering AD; 30% only in the past and 11% currently. The former administration of AD (TR = 1.02, 95% CI, 0.93-1.12) was unrelated to the ongoing duration of pregnancy attempt. Among nurses currently administering AD, those who had administered AD for 6 years and above had a 27% (95% CI, 6%-53%) longer duration of pregnancy attempt than nurses who never handled ADs in unadjusted analyses. This difference disappeared in multivariable analyses (TR = 1.01, 95% CI, 0.85-1.21). 93% (n = 270) of the nurses currently administering ADs reported consistent use of EC. These nurses had a similar median duration of pregnancy attempt to those who never handled AD (TR = 1.00, 95% CI, 0.87-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of ADs did not appear to have an impact on fecundity in a cohort of nurses planning for pregnancy with a high prevalence of consistent ECs. Our results may not be generalizable to women who are less compliant with PPE use or with less availability to ECs. Therefore, it is possible that we did not observe an association between occupational exposure to AD and reduced fecundity because of lower exposure due to the more prevalent use of effective ECs.","1097-0274:Nassan, Feiby L:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3204-0694:Lawson, Christina C:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3401-3921:Gaskins, Audrey J:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0812-7439:Johnson, Candice Y:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2544-3110:Boiano, James M:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2738-4588:Rich-Edwards, Janet W:ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5066-8808:Chavarro, Jorge E:K99ES026648/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences:National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Contract Number 200-2013-M-54978:Journal Article:United States:Am J Ind Med. 2019 Jun 20. doi: 10.1002/ajim.23015.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219624","Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.

The dominant modifiable risk factors and the social and environmental determinants that increase cardiovascular risk are known, and collectively, are as important in racial and ethnic minority populations as they are in majority populations. Their prevention and treatment remain the foundation for cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention. Genetic and epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized as important contributors to cardiovascular risk and provide an opportunity for advancing precision cardiovascular medicine. In this review, we explore emerging concepts at the interface of precision medicine and cardiovascular disease in racial and ethnic minority populations. Important among these are the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in genomics studies and biorepositories; the resulting misclassification of benign variants as pathogenic in minorities; and the importance of ensuring ancestry-matched controls in variant interpretation. We address the relevance of epigenetics, pharmacogenomics, genetic testing and counseling, and their social and cultural implications. We also examine the potential impact of precision medicine on racial and ethnic disparities. The National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Initiative are presented as examples of research programs at the forefront of precision medicine and diversity to explore research implications in minorities. We conclude with an overview of implementation research challenges in precision medicine and the ethical implications in minority populations. Successful implementation of precision medicine in cardiovascular disease in minority populations will benefit from strategies that directly address diversity and inclusion in genomics research and go beyond race and ethnicity to explore ancestry-matched controls, as well as geographic, cultural, social, and environmental determinants of health.","1524-4571:Mensah, George A:Jaquish, Cashell:Srinivas, Pothur:Papanicolaou, George J:Wei, Gina S:Redmond, Nicole:Roberts, Megan C:Nelson, Cheryl:Aviles-Santa, Larissa:Puggal, Mona:Green Parker, Melissa C:Minear, Mollie A:Barfield, Whitney:Fenton, Kathleen N:Boyce, Cheryl Anne:Engelgau, Michael M:Khoury, Muin J:Journal Article:United States:Circ Res. 2019 Jun 21;125(1):7-13. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314970.

In this study, we aimed to: (1) determine the pathogens associated with infections in children with nephrotic syndrome and (2) describe antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae to guide evidence-based treatment and prevention policies. METHODS: From June 2013 to March 2015, we collected blood and/or ascitic fluid from children hospitalized with nephrotic syndrome and suspected bacterial disease in the largest pediatric hospital of Bangladesh. We cultured all samples and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunochromatographic test on ascitic fluid for detection of S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility using disc diffusion and serotyped using Quellung reaction and PCR. RESULTS: We identified 1342 children hospitalized with nephrotic syndrome. Among them, 608 children had suspected bacterial disease from whom blood and/or ascitic fluid were collected. A pathogen was identified in 8% (48/608) of cases, 94% (45/48) of which were S. pneumoniae. Most (73%, 33/45) pneumococcal infections were identified through culture of blood and ascitic fluid and 27% (12/45) through immunochromatographic test and PCR of ascitic fluid. In total, 24 different pneumococcal serotypes were detected; 51% are covered by PCV10 (+6A), 53% by PCV13 and 60% by PPSV23. All pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Because S. pneumoniae was the primary cause of invasive infections, pneumococcal vaccines may be considered as a preventive intervention in children with nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, penicillin can be used to prevent and treat pneumococcal infections in children with nephrotic syndrome in Bangladesh.","1532-0987:Malaker, Roly:Saha, Senjuti:Hanif, Mohammed:Ahmed, Asmnu:Saha, Shampa:Hasanuzzaman, Md:Khondakar, Tarannum:Islam, Maksuda:Baqui, Abdullah H:Santosham, Mathuram:Darmstadt, Gary L:Whitney, Cynthia G:Saha, Samir K:Journal Article:United States:Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2019 Jun 17. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000002386.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220048","From the Child Health Research Foundation, Department of Microbiology, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh.:Department of Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.:Bangladesh Institute of Child Health, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh.:Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.:Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.",,,,,,,"NLM","eng",,"10.1097/inf.0000000000002386"

We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control. METHODS: Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25.7 million adults (age 15-99 years) and 75 000 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995-2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. FINDINGS: 5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005-09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15-19% in North America, and as low as 7-9% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10-20% between 1995-99 and 2005-09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50% to more than 70%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995-99 and 2005-09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005-09, 5-year survival was 40% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005-09 was high (54-58%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18-23%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60% in several countries, but as high as 90% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease. INTERPRETATION: International comparison of survival trends reveals very wide differences that are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimum treatment. Continuous worldwide surveillance of cancer survival should become an indispensable source of information for cancer patients and researchers and a stimulus for politicians to improve health policy and health-care systems.

Emergency departments (ED) are an important location for diagnosing STIs. This study compared recommended treatment of CT in EDs to treatment in physician offices. Five years of data (2006-2010) were analyzed from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NHAMCS), including the Outpatient survey (NHAMCS-OPD) and Emergency Department survey (NHAMCS-ED). All visits with a CT diagnosis and those with a diagnosis of unspecified venereal disease were selected for analysis. Differences in receipt of recommended treatments were compared between visits to physician offices and emergency departments using Chi square tests and logistic regression models. During the 5 year period, approximately 3.2 million ambulatory care visits had diagnosed CT or an unspecified venereal disease. A greater proportion of visits to EDs received the recommended treatment for CT compared to visits to physician offices (66.1 vs. 44.9 %, p < .01). When controlling for patients' age, sex and race/ethnicity, those presenting to the ED with CT were more likely to receive the recommended antibiotic treatment than patients presenting to a physician's office (OR 2.16; 95 % CI 1.04-4.48). This effect was attenuated when further controlling for patients' expected source of payment. These analyses demonstrate differences in the treatment of CT by ambulatory care setting as well as opportunities for increasing use of recommended treatments for diagnosed cases of this important STI.","Editorial Board Reviewed; Expert Peer Reviewed; Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

Current depressive symptoms within a two-week timeframe were assessed using the patient health questionnaire-2 from the 2006 and 2008 behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS) administered in selected states. State socio-economic deprivation indexes (percent of people below poverty level; employment/population ratio for the population 16 to 64 years old; median household income) were obtained from the 2006 and 2008 American community survey (ACS). State Gini indexes (indicating income inequality) were obtained from 2000 U.S. Census. After controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, annual household income, and chronic physical health condition index, adults residing in states with median household income in the lowest quintile (OR (95% CI)=1.18 (1.16 to 1.20) vs. others), in states with population below poverty line greater than the fourth quintile (OR (95% CI)=1.22 (1.20 to 1.24), vs. others), in states with employment/population ratios in the lowest quintile (OR(95% CI)=1.31 (1.29 to 1.34), vs. others), and in states with higher income inequality (GINI index >0.452) (OR(95% CI)=1.22 (1.21-1.24), vs. others) had higher odds of current depression. The results suggest that state-level socioeconomic factors are associated with depression prevalence among U.S. adults beyond individual level socioeconomic characteristics.","Author Affiliation: Division of Behavioral Surveillance, Public Health Surveillance Program Office (PHSPO), Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services (OSELS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.: Author Email: afan@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v3iss50_Authors_Fan.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Nairobi",

Mol. Biol.","00222836 (ISSN)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Forced copy-choice recombination: Retroviral error mechanisms","A key contributor to HIV-1 genetic variation is reverse transcriptase errors. Some mutations result because reverse transcriptase (RT) lacks 3' to 5' proofreading exonuclease and can extend mismatches. However, RT also excises terminal nucleotides to a limited extent, and this activity contributes to AZT resistance. Because HIV-1 mismatch resolution has been studied in vitro but only indirectly during replication, we developed a novel system to study mismatched base pair resolution during HIV-1 replication in cultured cells using vectors that force template switching at defined locations. These vectors generated mismatched reverse transcription intermediates, with proviral products diagnostic of mismatch resolution mechanisms. Outcomes for wild-type (WT) RT and an AZT-resistant (AZTR) RT containing a thymidine analog mutation set-D67N, K70R, D215F, and K219Q-were compared. AZTR RT did not excise terminal nucleotides more frequently than WT, and for the majority of tested mismatches, both WT and AZTR RTs extended mismatches in more than 90% of proviruses. However, striking enzyme-specific differences were observed for one mispair, with WT RT preferentially resolving dC-rC pairs either by excising the mismatched base or switching templates prematurely, while AZTR RT primarily misaligned the primer strand, causing deletions via dislocation mutagenesis. Overall, the results confirmed HIV-1 RT's high capacity for mismatch extension during virus replication and revealed dramatic differences in aberrant intermediate resolution repertoires between WT and AZTR RTs on one mismatched replication intermediate. Correlating mismatch extension frequencies observed here with reported viral mutation rates suggests a complex interplay of nucleotide discrimination and mismatch extension drives HIV-1 mutagenesis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: JMOBA: Correspondence Address: Telesnitsky, A.email: ateles@umich.edu",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84963772852&partnerID=40&md5=f93492cf8ebd70d9b7eadee185b22383","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5620, USA: CDC, Lusaka, Zambia: Department of Harmaceutical Sciences, South Dakota State University.

Early programs were mainly education based with many of the findings now embedded in school policy in the form of a healthy eating curriculum. More recent school programs have taken education outside the classroom and attempted to engage parents as well as teachers. Environmental changes such as improving the quality of foods available at lunchtime and at other times during the school day are now common. Reviews of evaluations of school-based programs have demonstrated that they are effective and successfully improve dietary quality such as increasing fruit and vegetable intake and decreasing sweet and savory snacks and sweetened drinks; not just in school but over the whole day and particularly in younger school children. School-based interventions are also effective at reducing obesity if components to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviors are also targeted but not if only dietary behaviors are tackled. Most of the high-quality evaluation studies using randomized controlled trials have been carried out in high-income countries as they are costly to run. However, middle-income countries have benefitted from the information available from these evaluation studies and many are now starting to fund and evaluate school-based programs themselves, resulting in unique problems such as concomitant under- and overnutrition being addressed. Action for the future demands more focus on populations most at risk of poor dietary quality and obesity in order to reduce inequalities in health and on adolescents who have not benefited as much as younger children from school-based interventions. This will involve innovative solutions within schools as well as targeting the food environment outside schools such as reducing the density of fast-food outlets and marketing of sweet and savory snacks and drinks. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Evans, C.E.L.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945433244&partnerID=40&md5=c932a06d8c05948af0c9dfd12e2d6c42: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043452615000558","Lecturer in Public Health Nutrition, Nutritional Epidemiology Group, School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK: School of Food Science and Nutrition, King Abdul-Aziz University, PO Box 42807, 21551 Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: Nanjing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2, Zizhulin, Nanjing 210003, China",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/bs.afnr.2015.07.003"

Significant changes of the levels of hippuric acid (0.403-fold decrease), citric acid (0.430-fold decrease), pantothenic acid (0.486-fold decrease), uracil (0.419-fold decrease), ?-Alanine (0.325-fold decrease), nonanedioic acid (0.445-fold decrease), l-tyrosine (0.410-fold decrease), d-glucuronic acid (8.389-fold increase) and 2-ethyl-6-methyl-N-methyl-2-chloro-acetanilide in urine were observed. In addition, it may interfere with the fatty acid synthesis, the pyrimidine degradation and pantothenate biosynthesis. The level of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-N-methyl-2-chloro-acetanilide is detected in all treated groups which is not found in the control groups, indicating which can be used as an early, sensitive marker of acetochlor exposure in rat. This study illustrates the important utility of metabonomics approaches to understand the toxicity of long-term exposure of acetochlor. © 2015.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: PCBPB: Correspondence Address: Zhang, Y.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945953973&partnerID=40&md5=d27be6e64bcc1adc15313f84a95db4bb: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048357515300389","Department of Toxicology, Public Health College, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, NanGang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China: Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Public Health College, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, NanGang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China: Heilongjiang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 Youfang Street, XiangFang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.09.013"

Influenza virus infection enhanced ICAM-1 expression and messenger RNA levels. Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) and nasal epithelial cells, on exposure to different strains of influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N1) showed significant increase in ICAM-1 gene expression (p<0.001) along with the ICAM-1 protein levels (surface and secreted). Depleting ICAM-1 in HBEpC with ICAM-1 siRNA and subsequently infecting with H1N1 showed increased viral copy numbers. Influenza virus infection in HBEpC resulted in up-regulation of NF-?B protein and the lack of ICAM-1 decreased NF-?B activity in NF-?B luciferase reporter assay. Addition of exogenous IL-1? to HBEpC induced the ICAM-1 expression and decreased matrix gene copy number. Taken together, HBEpC induced ICAM-1 plays a key role in modulating the influenza virus survival possibly through the NF-?B pathway. © 2015.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: VIRLA: Correspondence Address: Othumpangat, S.; Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, MS4020, United States: References: Blachere, F.M., Cao, G., Lindsley, W.G., Noti, J.D., Beezhold, D.H., Enhanced detection of infectious airborne influenza virus (2011) J.

We aimed to examine CRC screening-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices among physicians and nurses working in Brazil's network of health units, and to describe the capacity of these units for CRC screening. In 2011, 1600 health units were randomly selected from all 26 states and the Federal District. One coordinator and one health care provider were selected for the interview. Response rates were 78% for coordinators, 34% for physicians, and 65% for nurses. The Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) recommendations for CRC screening were not often used in the health units, but screening outreach and use of CRC exams were more common in units that were using them. Physicians and nurses differed in most characteristics, and in their knowledge, attitudes, and practices of CRC screening. Forty-seven percent of physicians reported not conducting CRC screening compared to 65% of nurses. Fecal occult blood test was most often used by physicians and nurses, but fewer physicians than nurses perceived this exam as very effective in reducing CRC mortality. Physicians' gender, years since graduation, and geographical region of practice in Brazil were associated to CRC screening practice. The findings may reflect the low influence of INCA CRC screening recommendations, physicians receiving their medical education when CRC burden in Brazil was of low concern, and the lack of CRC screening capacity in some regions of Brazil. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: PVTMA: Correspondence Address: Saraiya, M.4770 Buford Highway NE, Mailstop K-76: References: Benson, V.S., Patnick, J., Davies, A.K., Nadel, M.R., Smith, R.A., Atkin, W.S., International Colorectal Cancer Screening Network.

Here we demonstrated that influenza VLPs can be made in Sf9 cells by using the bovine immunodeficiency virus gag (Bgag) protein in place of M1. We showed that Bgag can be used to prepare VLPs for several influenza subtypes including H1N1 and H10N8. Furthermore, by using Bgag, we prepared quadri-subtype VLPs, which co-expressed within the VLP the four HA subtypes derived from avian-origin H5N1, H7N9, H9N2 and H10N8 viruses. VLPs showed hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities and reacted with specific antisera. The content and co-localization of each HA subtype within the quadri-subtype VLP were evaluated. Electron microscopy showed that Bgag-based VLPs resembled influenza virions with the diameter of 150-200. nm. This is the first report of quadri-subtype design for influenza VLP and the use of Bgag for influenza VLP preparation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: VIRLA: Correspondence Address: Pushko, P.; Medigen, Inc., 8420 Gas House Pike, Suite S, United States: Funding Details: R01 AI111532, NIFA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture: References: Belser, J.A., Blixt, O., Chen, L.M., Pappas, C., Maines, T.R., Van Hoeven, N., Donis, R., Tumpey, T.M., Contemporary North American influenza H7 viruses possess human receptor specificity: implications for virus transmissibility (2008) Proc.

As a vector-borne disease, rates of plague transmission may increase when fleas are abundant. Fleas are highly susceptible to desiccation under hot-dry conditions; we posited that their densities decline during droughts. We evaluated this hypothesis with black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in New Mexico, June-August 2010-2012. Precipitation was relatively plentiful during 2010 and 2012 but scarce during 2011, the driest spring-summer on record for the northeastern grasslands of New Mexico. Unexpectedly, fleas were 200% more abundant in 2011 than in 2010 and 2012. Prairie dogs were in 27% better condition during 2010 and 2012, and they devoted 287% more time to grooming in 2012 than in 2011. During 2012, prairie dogs provided with supplemental food and water were in 23% better condition and carried 40% fewer fleas. Collectively, these results suggest that during dry years, prairie dogs are limited by food and water, and they exhibit weakened defenses against fleas. Long-term data are needed to evaluate the generality of whether droughts increase flea densities and how changes in flea abundance during sequences of dry and wet years might affect plague cycles in mammalian hosts.","Cited By :1: Export Date: 18 August 2016: CODEN: JOMAA: Correspondence Address: Eads, D.A.; U.S. Geological Survey, Fort Collins Science Center, Building C, 2150 Centre Avenue, United States; email: deads@usgs.gov: Funding Details: CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Funding Details: 1027319, NSF, National Science Foundation: Funding Details: USGS, U.S. Geological Survey: References: Altizer, S., Ostfeld, R.S., Johnson, P.J.T., Kutz, S., Harvell, C.D., Climate change and infectious diseases: From evidence to a predictive framework (2013) Science, 341, pp. 514-519; Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-266; Anderson, G.W., Hilley, T.E., Martin, P.G., Jr., Neal, C.R., Gomez, R.S., Soil survey of colfax county, New Mexico (1982) U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service and Forest Service, , Washington, D.C; Bakko, E.B., Field water balance performance in prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus and C ludovicianus) (1977) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, A.

METHODS: We used the 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen data to assess HPV vaccine uptake (?1 dose) and series completion (?3 doses). Multivariable logistic regression analysis and a predictive marginal model were conducted to identify independent predictors of vaccination among adolescent males aged 13 to 17 years. RESULTS: HPV vaccination coverage with ?1 dose was 34.6%, and series completion (?3 doses) was 13.9%. Coverage was significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic white male adolescents. Multivariable logistic regression showed that characteristics independently associated with a higher likelihood of HPV vaccination (?1 dose) included being non-Hispanic black race or Hispanic ethnicity; having mothers who were widowed, divorced, or separated; having 1 to 3 physician contacts in the past 12 months; a well-child visit at age 11 to 12 years; having 1 or 2 vaccination providers; living in urban or suburban areas; and receiving vaccinations from >1 type of facility (P < .05). Having mothers with some college or college education, having a higher family income to poverty ratio, living in the South or Midwest, and receiving vaccinations from all sexually transmitted diseases/ school/teen clinics or other facilities were independently associated with a lower likelihood of HPV vaccination (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Following recommendations for routine HPV vaccination among male adolescents, uptake in 2013 was low in this population. Increased efforts are needed to improve vaccination coverage, especially for those who are least likely to be vaccinated.","Accession Number: 110842595. Language: English. Entry Date: 20151112.

We studied the epidemiology of LRTI hospitalization in HIVunexposed uninfected (HUU) and HEU infants aged < months in South Africa. Methods: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized infants with LRTI from 4 provinces from 2010 to 2013. Using polymerase chain reaction, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for 10 viruses and blood for pneumococcal DNA. Incidence for 2010-2011 was estimated at 1 site with population denominators. Results: We enrolled 3537 children aged <6 months. HIV infection and exposure status were determined for 2507 (71%), of whom 211 (8%) were HIV infected, 850 (34%) were HEU, and 1446 (58%) were HUU. The annual incidence of LRTI was elevated in HEU (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-1.5) and HIV infected (IRR 3.8; 95% CI 3.3-4.5), compared with HUU infants. Relative incidence estimates were greater in HEU than HUU, for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; IRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and human metapneumovirus-associated (IRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-2.0) LRTI, with a similar trend observed for influenza (IRR 1.2; 95% CI 0.8-1.8). HEU infants overall, and those with RSV-associated LRTI had greater odds (odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8, and 12.2, 95% CI 1.7-infinity, respectively) of death than HUU. Conclusions: HEU infants were more likely to be hospitalized and to die in-hospital than HUU, including specifically due to RSV. This group should be considered a high-risk group for LRTI.",,,"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/137/4/peds.2015-3272.full.pdf: http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed13&NEWS=N&AN=20160281532","C.

Ecologically, prairie dogs are a keystone species in prairie ecology. This species is used as an animal model for human gallbladder disease and diseases caused by infection with Clostridium difficile, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and most recently, Orthopoxvirus. Despite increasing numbers of prairie dogs used in research and kept as pets, few data are available on their baseline physiology in animal facility housing conditions. To establish baseline physiologic reference ranges, we designed a study using 18 wild-caught black-tailed prairie dogs. Telemetry data were analyzed to establish circadian rhythms for activity and temperature. In addition, hematologic and serum chemistry analyses were performed. Baseline measurements were used to establish the mean for each animal, which then were compiled and analyzed to determine the reference ranges. Here we present physiologic data on serum chemistry and hematology profiles, as well as weight, core body temperature, and daily activity patterns for black-tailed prairie dogs.

Botulism is confirmed in the laboratory by the detection of BoNT in clinical specimens, contaminated foods, and cultures. Despite efforts to develop an in vitro method for botulinum toxin detection, the mouse bioassay remains the standard test for laboratory confirmation of this disease. In this study, we evaluated the use of a nonlethal mouse toe-spread reflex model to detect BoNT spiked into buffer, serum, and milk samples. Samples spiked with toxin serotype A and nontoxin control samples were injected into the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscles, respectively. Digital photographs at 0,8, and 24 h were used to obtain objective measurements through effective paralysis scores, which were determined by comparing the width-to-length ratio between right and left feet. Both objective measurements and clinical observation could accurately identify over 80% of animals injected with 1 LD50 (4.3 pg) BoNT type A within 24 h. Half of animals injected with 0.5 LD50 BoNT type A and none injected with 0.25 LD50 demonstrated localized paralysis. Preincubating the toxin with antitoxin prevented the development of positive effective paralysis scores, demonstrating that (1) the effect was specific for BoNT and (2) identification of toxin serotype could be achieved by using this method. These results suggest that the mouse toe-spread reflex model may be a more humane alternative to the current mouse bioassay for laboratory investigations of botulism.","Author Affiliation: Division of Scientific Resources, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.: Author Email: SMaslanka@cdc.gov",,,,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Memphis",

Recently, clade 7 H5N1 viruses of the Eurasian lineage were isolated from chickens seized at ports of entry in Lang Son Province, Vietnam. Extensive nucleotide and amino acid divergence across the hemagglutinin (HA) protein gene of these isolates in comparison to previously described clade 7 viruses was identified. Clade 7 viruses are antigenically distinct from contemporary strains of H5N1 known to circulate in Vietnamese poultry (clade 1 and clade 2.3.4). Subsequent surveillance of sick poultry in live poultry markets in Hai Duong Province identified additional clade 7 isolates with HA genes very similar to the group B virus cluster detected previously at the Lang Son Province border. Antigenic analysis of the isolates from the live bird markets revealed significant cross-reactivity only between those clade 7 viruses belonging to the same subgroups. To meet pandemic response preparedness objectives, we have developed a reassortant virus from A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-016/2008, which could be used as a new prepandemic vaccine candidate for veterinary or human vaccination, should the need arise.

Previous reports have shown that, while organic modifiers integration between the layered mineral silicates leads to nanoclays with different degrees of hydrophobicity that become easily miscible in polymers, they could also pose possible effects at inhalation or ingestion routes of exposure. Through a systematic analysis of three organically modified and one pristine nanoclay, we aimed to relate for the first time the physical and chemical characteristics, determined via microscopical and spectroscopical techniques, with the potential of these nanoclays to induce deleterious effects in in vitro cellular systems, i.e. in immortalized and primary human lung epithelial cell lines. To derive information on how functionalization could lead to toxicological profiles throughout nanoclays' life cycle, both as-received and thermally degraded nanoclays were evaluated. Our analysis showed that the organic modifiers chemical composition influenced both the physical and chemical characteristics of the nanoclays as well as their toxicity. Overall, when cells were exposed to nanoclays with organic modifiers containing bioreactive groups, they displayed lower cellular numbers as well more elongated cellular morphologies relative to the pristine nanoclay and the nanoclay containing a modifier with long carbon chains. Additionally, thermal degradation caused loss of the organic modifiers as well as changes in size and shape of the nanoclays, which led to changes in toxicity upon exposure to our model cellular systems. Our study provides insight into the synergistic effects of chemical composition, size, and shape of the nanoclays and their toxicological profiles in conditions that mimic exposure in manufacturing and disposal environments, respectively, and can help aid in safe-by-design manufacturing of nanoclays with user-controlled functionalization and lower toxicity levels when food packaging applications are considered. 2017 American Chemical Society.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.: 20173904202701: Chemical compositions: Food-packaging materials: Human lung: Model cellular systems: Nano clays: Organic modifier: Physical and chemical characteristics: Physical and chemical properties",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b06657","Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown; WV; 26506, United StatesHealth Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown; WV; 26505, United StatesDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown; WV; 26506, United StatesDepartment of Basic Pharmaceutical Sciences, West Virginia University, Morgantown; WV; 26506, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1021/acsami.7b06657"

We demonstrate that the dispersal of as-prepared (AP), purified (PD), and carboxylated (COOH) MWCNTs by bovine serum albumin (BSA) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) influences TGF-1, PDGF-AA, and IL-1 production in vitro and in vivo. These biomarkers were chosen based on their synergy in promoting fibrogenesis and cellular communication in the epithelial-mesenchymal cell trophic unit in the lung. The effect of dispersal was most noticeable in AP- and PD-MWCNTs, which are more hydrophobic and unstable in aqueous buffers than hydrophilic COOH-MWCNTs. Well-dispersed AP- and PD-MWCNTs were readily taken up by BEAS-2B, THP-1 cells, and alveolar macrophages (AM) and induced more prominent TGF-1 and IL-1 production in vitro and TGF-1, IL-1, and PDGF-AA production in vivo than nondispersed tubes. Moreover, there was good agreement between the profibrogenic responses in vitro and in vivo as well as the ability of dispersed tubes to generate granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis in airways. Tube dispersal also elicited more robust IL-1 production in THP-1 cells. While COOH-MWCNTs were poorly taken up in BEAS-2B and induced little TGF-1 production, they were bioprocessed by AM and induced less prominent collagen deposition at sites of nongranulomatous inflammation in the alveolar region. Taken together, these results indicate that the dispersal state of MWCNTs affects profibrogenic cellular responses that correlate with the extent of pulmonary fibrosis and are of potential use to predict pulmonary toxicity.

BoNT is classified into seven distinct serotypes labeled A-G. Among individual serotypes, researchers have identified subtypes based on amino acid variability within a serotype and toxin variants with minor amino acid sequence differences within a subtype. BoNT subtype identification is valuable for tracing and tracking bacterial pathogens. A proteomics approach is useful for BoNT subtyping since botulism is caused by botulinum neurotoxin and does not require the presence of the bacteria or its DNA. Enzymatic digestion and peptide identification using tandem mass spectrometry determines toxin protein sequences. However, with the conventional one-step digestion method, producing sufficient numbers of detectable peptides to cover the entire protein sequence is difficult, and incomplete sequence coverage results in uncertainty in distinguishing BoNT subtypes and toxin variants because of high sequence similarity. We report here a method of multiple enzymes and sequential in-gel digestion (MESID) to characterize the BoNT protein sequence. Complementary peptide detection from toxin digestions has yielded near-complete sequence coverage for all seven BoNT serotypes. Application of the method to a BoNT-contaminated carrot juice sample resulted in the identification of 98.4% protein sequence which led to a confident determination of the toxin subtype.

Here, we report the crystal structure and characterization of Tgl, a transglutaminase from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Tgl is produced during sporulation and cross-links the surface of the highly resilient spore. Tgl-like proteins are found only in spore-forming bacteria of the Bacillus and Clostridia classes, indicating an ancient origin. Tgl is a single-domain protein, produced in active form, and the smallest transglutaminase characterized to date. We show that Tgl is structurally similar to bacterial cell wall endopeptidases and has an NlpC/P60 catalytic core, thought to represent the ancestral unit of the cysteine protease fold. We show that Tgl functions through a unique partially redundant catalytic dyad formed by Cys116 and Glu187 or Glu115. Strikingly, the catalytic Cys is insulated within a hydrophobic tunnel that traverses the molecule from side to side. The lack of similarity of Tgl to other transglutaminases together with its small size suggests that an NlpC/P60 catalytic core and insulation of the active site during catalysis may be essential requirements for protein cross-linking.","Export Date: 1 October 2015: CODEN: BICHA: Correspondence Address: Archer, M.; Membrane Protein Crystallography, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, ITQB-UNLPortugal: References: Griffin, M., Casadio, R., Bergamini, C.M., Transglutaminases: Nature's biological glues (2002) Biochem.

DDE is associated with metabolic diseases acting as an endocrine disruptor and more recently with the obesity pandemic. This study focuses on using fatty acid analysis to relate DDE exposure and metabolic dysfunction: liver and adipose tissue (visceral and subcutaneous) composition from male Wistar rats fed a standard (STD) or high-fat (HF) diet versus the addition of DDE in water. DDE exposure increased liver levels of palmitic, stearic, oleic, trans fatty, and linoleic acids having altered the n6 and n3 pathways leading to high concentrations of arachidonic acid and DHA (C22:6 n3). The results of this study confirm the close relationship between this pesticide metabolite and hepatic lipid dysfunction, underscoring its role as an emerging target for the prevention and therapy of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 2015 American Chemical Society.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20154501494427: Adipose tissue: DDE: Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane: Fatty acid composition: NAFLD: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: obesity: Pesticide metabolites",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03274: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03274","CBQF - Centro de Biotecnologia e Qumica Fina-Laboratorio Associado, Escola Superior de Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa/Porto, Rua Arquiteto Lobao Vital, Apartado 2511, Porto, PortugalDepartment of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Centro de Investigacao Medica, Porto, PortugalCINTESIS-Center for Research in Health Technologies and Information Systems, Porto, PortugalChemistry Investigation Centre (CIQ), Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto, Rua do Campo Alegre, Porto, PortugalFaculty of Nutrition and Food Sciences, University of Porto, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, Porto, Portugal",,,,,,"Compendex",,,,"10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03274"

Smokeless tobacco products were dried, milled, and amended with 13C17-labeled internal standards, extracted in water/methanol solution in the presence of a surfactant, isolated through use of immunoaffinity column chromatography, and reconstituted in mobile phase prior to UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. The method was capable of baseline separation of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 in a 2.5 min run by use of a fused core C18 column and a water/methanol gradient. MS/MS transition (m/z) 313.3' 241.2 was used for aflatoxin B1 quantitation, with 313.3' 285.1 used for confirmation. The limit of detection (LOD) for aflatoxin B1 was 0.007 parts per billion (ppb). Method imprecision for aflatoxin B1 (expressed as coefficient of variation) ranged from 5.5 to 9.4%. Spike recoveries were 105-111%. Aflatoxin B1 concentrations in the smokeless tobacco products analyzed ranged from <LOD to 0.271 ppb (dry mass). Aflatoxin B1 was most frequently detected in dry snuffs and chews, whereas all moist snuff products tested were below LOD. The amounts of aflatoxin B1 detected were low relative to the 20 ppb regulatory limit established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for foods and feeds.

This method involves deposition of aerosol particles on the tip of a cathode in a coaxial microelectrode system, followed by ablation, atomization, and excitation of the particulate matter using the rf-GD. The resulting atomic emissions are recorded using a spectrometer for elemental identification and quantification. The glow discharge plasma in our system was characterized by measuring spatially resolved gas temperatures (378-1438 K) and electron densities (2-5 1014cm-3). Spatial analysis of the spectral features showed that the excitation of the analyte occurred in the region near the collection electrode. The temporal analysis of spectral features in the rf-GD showed that the collected particles were continuously ablated; the time for complete ablation of 193 ng of sucrose particles was found to be approximately 2 s. The system was calibrated using 100 nm particles containing C, Cd, Mn, and Na, respectively. The method provides limits of detection in the range of 0.055-1.0 ng, and a measurement reproducibility of 5-28%.

We have applied the MRQCS to a comparison of instructor-led and computer-led prelaboratory instruction for a supplemental learning experiment. Students in general chemistry and analytical chemistry from both two- and four-year institutions performed two laboratory experiments as part of their normal laboratory curriculum. The first laboratory experiment was a foundational learning experiment in which all of the students were introduced to the Beer-Lambert law and spectrophotometric light absorbance measurements. The foundational learning experiment was instructor-led only, and participant performance was evaluated against a mean characterized value. The second laboratory experiment was a supplemental learning experiment in which students were asked to build upon the methodology they learned in the foundational learning experiment and apply it to a different analyte. The instruction type was varied randomly into two delivery modes, with participants receiving either instructor-led or computer-led prelaboratory instruction. The MRQCS was applied, and it was determined that there was no statistical difference between the quality control passing rates of the participants receiving instructor-led instruction and those receiving computer-led instruction.

They form the basis of robust prediction models and are widely used for the recruitment of subjects at high risk of type 1 diabetes to prevention trials. However, GADAs are also found in many individuals at low risk of diabetes progression. To identify the sources of diabetes-irrelevant GADA reactivity, we analyzed data from the 2009 and 2010 Diabetes Autoantibody Standardization Program GADA workshop and found that binding of healthy control sera varied according to assay type. The characterization of control sera found positive by radiobinding assay (RBA), but negative by ELISA, showed that many of these sera reacted to epitopes in the N-terminal region of the molecule. This finding prompted development of an N-terminally truncated GAD65 radiolabel, 35S-GAD65(96-585), which improved the performance of most GADA RBAs participating in an Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program GADA substudy. These detailed workshop comparisons have identified a source of disease-irrelevant signals in GADA RBAs and suggest that N-terminally truncated GAD labels will enable more specific measurement of GADAs in type 1 diabetes. © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: CODEN: DIAEA: Correspondence Address: Williams, A.J.K.;

Four different NIST standard reference materials (610, 613, 615, and 616) were ablated using 400 nm and 800 nm fs laser pulses to study the effect of wavelength on laser ablation rate, accuracy, precision, and fractionation. Our results show that the detection limits are lower for 400 nm laser excitation than 800 nm laser excitation at lower laser energies but approximately equal at higher energies. Ablation threshold was also found to be lower for 400 nm than 800 nm laser excitation. Particle size distributions are very similar for 400 nm and 800 nm wavelengths; however, they differ significantly in counts at similar laser fluence levels. This study concludes that 400 nm LA is more beneficial for sample introduction in ICP-MS, particularly when lower laser energies are to be used for ablation.","13632083: laser excitation: elemental fractionation: detection limits: signal intensity: particle distribution: laser generated aerosol counts: femtosecond laser: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry: laser ablation: ultrafast laser wavelength: wavelength 800 nm: wavelength 400 nm",,,"Center for Mater. under Extreme Environ., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, United States",,,,,,,,,"USA","10.1063/1.4812491"

Permethrin is a contact insecticide so only the permethrin on the surface can directly impact the mosquito. Therefore, knowledge of the surface concentration of the insecticide is essential to measure the effectiveness of the treated material. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis of permethrin showed Cl- as the predominant species in the negative ion mass spectrum. The netting material in this study is composed of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Ion implantation was used to place a known amount of chlorine into the netting material, sheet HDPE, and silicon samples. Depth profile analysis of the implanted samples showed distinct chlorine implant profiles, with the silicon sample used to verify implant dose. Quantification and detection limit for chlorine have been obtained for HDPE sheet and netting. The chlorine detection limit in HDPE is approximately 2 × 1018 atoms/cm3, and the chlorine concentration in netting fibers ranged from 4 × 1019 to 1.2 × 1020 atoms/cm3, which compares very well with the amount of insecticide put into the netting during fabrication. The results make possible the study of insecticide content at the surface and in the bulk of the netting.

RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in rates of medically attended acute adverse events or adverse birth outcomes related to timing since prior tetanus-containing vaccination. [TABLE PRESENTED] Conclusions and Relevance Amongwomen who received Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, there was no increased risk of acute adverse events or adverse birth outcomes for those who had been previously vaccinated less than 2 years before or 2 to 5 years before compared with those who had been vaccinated more than 5 years before. These findings suggest that relatively recent receipt of a prior tetanus-containing vaccination does not increase risk after Tdap vaccination in pregnancy.",,,"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2463256: http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed13&NEWS=N&AN=2015462020","L.

Therefore, Web-based survey responses may not be representative of the general public, whereas CASPERs produce generalizable results and data collection can be done quickly. This is one of the first times NWS has partnered with public health to assess extreme-weather warnings.

Further, this study examined the stress men experience from their attempts to adhere to traditional male gender roles as a moderator of this mediational path. METHOD: Participants (n 252) completed measures of traditional masculinity, decisional balance (i.e., weighing the pros and cons) for intervening, masculine gender roles stress, and bystander efficacy. RESULTS: The belief that men must attain social status was associated with more confidence in men's ability to intervene. This effect was mediated by greater perceived positive consequences for intervention among men high, but not low, in masculine gender role stress. The belief that men should be tough and aggressive was associated with greater perceived negative consequences for intervention and less confidence to intervene. The belief that men should not act in stereotypically feminine ways was directly associated with less confidence for intervention. CONCLUSIONS:  Findings highlight the importance of examining masculinity from a multidimensional perspective to better understand how adherence to various norms differentially influences bystander behavior. These findings may help to inform bystander intervention programming.","Export Date: 28 January 2016: Correspondence Address: Parrott, D.J.; Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, P.O.

METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to assess associations among demographic characteristics, health care access and utilization indicators, modifiable health behaviors, and HRQOL characterized by recent physically and mentally unhealthy days in those with and those without functional limitations. We defined functional limitations as activity limitations owing to physical, mental, or emotional health or as the need for special equipment because of health. RESULTS: Age, medical care costs, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking were strongly associated with both physically and mentally unhealthy days among those with functional limitations. Among those without functional limitations, the direction of the effects was similar, but the size of the effects was substantially smaller. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of lower cost medical care, increasing leisure-time physical activity, and reducing rates of cigarette smoking will improve population HRQOL among older adults with and without functional limitations. These factors provide valuable information for determining future public health priorities.","Author Affiliation: Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 4770 Buford Highway NE, MS K-51, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA.: Author Email: wct2@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v4iss8_Authors_Thompson.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Washington","10.2105/ajph.2011.300500"

We assessed the characteristics of sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients, their reasons for seeking health services in STD clinics, and their access to health care in other venues. Methods. In 2013, we surveyed persons who used publicly funded STD clinics in 21 US cities with the highest STD morbidity. Results. Of the 4364 STD clinic patients we surveyed, 58.5% were younger than 30 years, 72.5% were non-White, and 49.9% were uninsured. They visited the clinic for STD symptoms (18.9%), STD screening (33.8%), and HIV testing (13.6%). Patients chose STD clinics because of walk-in, same-day appointments (49.5%), low cost (23.9%), and expert care (8.3%). Among STD clinic patients, 60.4% had access to another type of venue for sick care, and 58.5% had access to another type of venue for preventive care. Most insured patients (51.6%) were willing to use insurance to pay for care at the STD clinic. Conclusions. Despite access to other health care settings, patients chose STD clinics for sexual health care because of convenient, low-cost, and expert care. Policy Implication. STD clinics play an important role in STD prevention by offering walk-in care to uninsured patients.","Accession Number: 110594937. Language: English. Entry Date: 20151106. Revision Date: 20151106.

We employed staged multivariable logistic regression and multivariable models stratified by no-show visit frequency to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with VF. We used multiple imputations to assign missing viral load values. RESULTS:  Among 10 053 patients (mean age = 46 years; 35% female; 64% Black; 15% with IDU history), 31% experienced VF. Although Black patients and patients with IDU history were significantly more likely to experience VF in initial analyses, race and IDU parameter estimates were attenuated after sequential addition of no-show frequency. In stratified models, race and IDU were not statistically significantly associated with VF at any no-show level. CONCLUSIONS: Because missed clinic visits contributed to observed differences in viral load outcomes among Black and IDU patients, achieving an improved understanding of differential visit attendance is imperative to reducing disparities in HIV.","research; tables/charts.

Acquisition of native structure is generally considered to be the most important prerequisite for ER exit. However, structurally detailed protein folding studies in the ER are few. Furthermore, aberrant ER quality control decisions are associated with a large and increasing number of human diseases, highlighting the need for more detailed studies on the molecular determinants that result in proteins being either secreted or retained. Here we used the clonotypic chains of the T cell receptor (TCR) as a model to analyze lumenal determinants of ER quality control with a particular emphasis on how proper assembly of oligomeric proteins can be monitored in the ER. A combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches allowed us to provide a detailed model for TCR assembly control in the cell. We found that folding of the TCR a chain constant domain C is dependent on heterodimerization. Furthermore, our data show that some variable regions associated with either chain can remain incompletely folded until chain pairing occurs. Together, these data argue for template-assisted folding at more than one point in the TCR / assembly process, which allows specific recognition of unassembled clonotypic chains by the ER chaperone machinery and, therefore, reliable quality control of this important immune receptor. Additionally, it highlights an unreported possible limitation in the a and chain combinations that comprise the T cell repertoire. 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20154501505456: Control decisions: Endoplasmic reticulum: Heterodimerization: Molecular determinants: Native structures: Oligomeric proteins: Secretory pathways: Specific recognition",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M115.689471: http://www.jbc.org/content/290/44/26821.full.pdf","Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Pl., Memphis; TN, United StatesDepartment of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis; TN, United StatesMorphoSys AG, Lena-Christ-Str. 48, Martinsried/Planegg, GermanyCenter for Integrated Protein Science, Dept. of Chemistry, Institute for Advanced Study, Technische Universitat Munchen, Lichtenbergstr. 2a, Garching, Germany",,,,,,"Compendex",,,"9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20814, United States","10.1074/jbc.M115.689471"

We used femur BMD data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 to estimate the prevalence of low femoral BMD in adults age 50 years and older and compared it with estimates from NHANES III (1988-1994). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry systems (pencil-beam geometry in NHANES III, fan-beam geometry in NHANES 2005-2006) were used to measure femur BMD, and World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of low BMD were used to categorize skeletal status. In 2005-2006, 49% of older US women had osteopenia and 10% had osteoporosis at the femur neck. In men, 30% had femur neck osteopenia and 2% had femur neck osteoporosis. An estimated 5.3 million older men and women had osteoporosis at the femur neck, and 34.5 million more had osteopenia in 2005-2006. When compared with NHANES III, the age-adjusted prevalence of femur neck osteoporosis in NHANES 2005-2006 was lower in men (by 3 percentage units) and women (by 7 percentage units) overall and among non-Hispanic whites. Changes in body mass index or osteoporosis medication use between surveys did not fully explain the decline in osteoporosis. Owing to the increase in the number of older adults in the US population, however, more older adults had low femur neck BMD (osteoporosis+osteopenia) in 2005-2006 than in 1988-1994. Thus, despite the decline in prevalence, the estimated number of affected older adults in 2005-2006 remained high.",,,"http://www.jbmr.org/details/journalArticle/554891/Prevalence_and_trends_in_low_femur_bone_density_among_older_US_adults_NHANES_200.html",,,,,,,,,"English","Washington","10.1359/jbmr.090706"

Ruminant livestock are common reservoirs for C. burnetii, and bacteria present in aerosols derived from the waste of infected animals can infect humans. The significance of infection from material deposited in the environment versus transmission directly from infected animals is not known. In 2011, an outbreak of Q fever cases on farms in Washington and Montana was associated with infected goats. A study was undertaken to investigate the quantity and spatial distribution of C. burnetii in the environment of these goat farms. Soil, vacuum, and sponge samples collected on seven farms epidemiologically linked to the outbreak were tested for the presence of C. burnetii DNA by quantitative PCR. Overall, 70.1% of the samples were positive for C. burnetii. All farms had positive samples, but the quantity of C. burnetii varied widely between samples and between farms. High quantities of C. burnetii DNA were in goat housing/ birthing areas, and only small quantities were found in samples collected more than 50mfrom these areas. Follow-up sampling at one of the farms 1 year after the outbreak found small quantities of C. burnetii DNA in air samples and large quantities of C. burnetii persisting in soil and vacuum samples. The results suggest that the highest concentrations of environmental C. burnetii are found in goat birthing areas and that contamination of other areas is mostly associated with human movement.

The spread of H5N8 and the novel reassortant viruses, H5N2 and H5N1 (H5Nx), in domestic poultry across multiple states in the United States pose a potential public health risk. To evaluate the potential of cross-species infection, we determined the pathogenicity and transmissibility of two Asian-origin H5Nx viruses in mammalian animal models. The newly isolated H5N2 and H5N8 viruses were able to cause severe disease in mice only at high doses. Both viruses replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of ferrets; however, the clinical symptoms were generally mild, and there was no evidence of systemic dissemination of virus to multiple organs. Moreover, these influenza H5Nx viruses lacked the ability to transmit between ferrets in a direct contact setting. We further assessed viral replication kinetics of the novel H5Nx viruses in a human bronchial epithelium cell line, Calu-3. Both H5Nx viruses replicated to a level comparable to a human seasonal H1N1 virus, but significantly lower than a virulent Asian-lineage H5N1 HPAI virus. Although the recently isolated H5N2 and H5N8 viruses displayed moderate pathogenicity in mammalian models, their ability to rapidly spread among avian species, reassort, and generate novel strains underscores the need for continued risk assessment in mammals.","Export Date: 1 October 2015: CODEN: JOVIA: Correspondence Address: Tumpey, T.M.; Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and PreventionUnited States: References: Jhung, M.A., Nelson, D.I., Outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N2), (H5N8), and (H5N1) among birds-United States, December 2014-January 2015 (2015) MMWRMorb Mortal Wkly Rep, 64, p. 111; Lee, C.W., Swayne, D.E., Linares, J.A., Senne, D.A., Suarez, D.L., H5N2 avian influenza outbreak in Texas in 2004: the first highly pathogenic strain in the United States in 20 years?

Yet, specific assays to quantitate indole are complex and require expensive equipment and a high level of training. Thus, indole in biological samples is often estimated using the simple and rapid Kovacs assay, which nonspecifically detects a variety of commonly occurring indole analogs. We demonstrate here a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for measuring indole in complex biological samples using a specific reaction between unsubstituted indole and hydroxylamine. We compared the hydroxylamine-based indole assay (HIA) to the Kovacs assay and confirmed that the two assays are capable of detecting microgram amounts of indole. However, the HIA is specific to indole and does not detect other naturally occurring indole analogs. We further demonstrated the utility of the HIA in measuring indole levels in clinically relevant biological materials, such as fecal samples and bacterial cultures. Mean and median fecal indole concentrations from 53 healthy adults were 2.59mM and 2.73 mM, respectively, but varied widely (0.30mM to 6.64 mM) among individuals. We also determined that enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strain H10407 produces 3.3 0.22mMindole during a 24-h period in the presence of 5mMtryptophan. The sensitive and specific HIA should be of value in a variety of settings, such as the evaluation of various clinical samples and the study of indole-producing bacterial species in the gut microbiota. 2015, American Society for Microbiology.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20154501508145: Bacterial cultures: Bacterial species: Biological samples: Clinical samples: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli: Expensive equipments: Naturally occurring: Pharmaceutical industry",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02787-15: http://aem.asm.org/content/81/23/8093.full.pdf","The University of Texas Health Science Center, School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics, and Environmental Sciences, Center for Infectious Diseases, Houston; TX, United StatesThe University of Texas M.

In addition, reference caspofungin MICs have so far proven to be unreliable. Candida species wild-type (WT) MIC distributions (for microorganisms in a species/drug combination with no detectable phenotypic resistance) were established for 6,007 Candida albicans, 186 C. dubliniensis, 3,188 C. glabrata complex, 119 C. guilliermondii, 493 C. krusei, 205 C. lusitaniae, 3,136 C. parapsilosis complex, and 1,016 C. tropicalis isolates. SYO MIC data gathered from 38 laboratories in Australia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States were pooled to statistically define SYO ECVs. ECVs for anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin encompassing >97.5% of the statistically modeled population were, respectively, 0.12,0.25, and 0.06 ?g/ml for C. albicans, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.03 ?g/ml for C. glabrata complex, 4, 2, and 4 ?g/ml for C. parapsilosis complex, 0.5,0.25, and 0.06 ?g/ml for C. tropicalis, 0.25,1, and 0.25 ?g/ml for C. krusei, 0.25,1, and 0.12 ?g/ml for C. lusitaniae, 4,2, and 2 ?g/ml for C. guilliermondii, and 0.25,0.25, and 0.12 ?g/ml for C. dubliniensis. Species-specific SYO ECVs for anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin correctly classified 72 (88.9%), 74 (91.4%), 76 (93.8%), respectively, of 81 Candida isolates with identified fks mutations. SYO ECVs may aid in detecting non-WT isolates with reduced susceptibility to anidulafungin, micafungin, and especially caspofungin, since testing the susceptibilities of Candida spp. to caspofungin by reference methodologies is not recommended.

Serodiagnostic assays to detect the early stages of infection, however, are limited in their sensitivity, and improvement is warranted. We analyzed a series of Borrelia burgdorferi proteins known to be induced within feeding ticks and/or during mammalian infection for their utility as serodiagnostic markers against a comprehensive panel of Lyme disease patient serum samples. The antigens were assayed for IgM and IgG reactivity in line immunoblots and separately by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a focus on reactivity against early Lyme disease with erythema migrans (EM), early disseminated Lyme neuroborreliosis, and early Lyme carditis patient serum samples. By IgM immunoblotting, we found that recombinant proteins BBA65, BBA70, and BBA73 reacted with early Lyme EM samples at levels comparable to those of the OspC antigen used in the current IgM blotting criteria. Additionally, these proteins reacted with serum samples from patients with early neuroborreliosis and early carditis, suggesting value in detecting early stages of this disease progression. We also found serological reactivity against recombinant proteins BBA69 and BBA73 with early-Lyme-disease samples using IgG immunoblotting and ELISA. Significantly, some samples that had been scored negative by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended 2-tiered testing algorithm demonstrated positive reactivity to one or more of the antigens by IgM/IgG immunoblot and ELISA. These results suggest that incorporating additional in vivo-expressed antigens into the current IgM/IgG immunoblotting tier in a recombinant protein platform assay may improve the performance of early-Lyme-disease serologic testing.

The use of monoclonal antibodies targeting the stem of the influenza virus surface hemagglutinin (HA) is a rapidly developing strategy for the control of viruses of multiple HA subtypes. However, the mechanisms of action of these antibodies are not fully understood, and their ability to mitigate severe complications of influenza has been poorly studied. We evaluated the effect of treatment with VIS410, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the HA stem region, on the development of ARDS in BALB/c mice after infection with influenza A(H7N9) viruses. Prophylactic administration of VIS410 resulted in the complete protection of mice against lethal A(H7N9) virus challenge. A single therapeutic dose of VIS410 given 24 h after virus inoculation resulted in dose-dependent protection of up to 100% of mice inoculated with neuraminidase inhibitor-susceptible or-resistant A(H7N9) viruses. Compared to the outcomes in mock-treated controls, a single administration of VIS410 improved viral clearance from the lungs, reduced virus spread in lungs in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a lower lung injury score, reduced the extent of the alteration in lung vascular permeability and protein accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and improved lung physiologic function. Thus, antibodies targeting the HA stem can reduce the severity of ARDS and show promise as agents for controlling pulmonary complications in influenza.

Successful breastfeeding among women with obesity is important for achieving national breastfeeding goals. Objectives: The objectives were to determine whether the negative association between obesity and any or exclusive breastfeeding at 1 and 2 mo postpartum is mediated through breastfeeding problems that occur in the first 2 wk postpartum and if this association differs by parity. Methods: Mothers (1151 normal-weight and 580 obese) in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II provided information on sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, body mass index, and breastfeeding outcomes. At 1 mo postpartum, participants reported the breastfeeding problems they experienced in the first 2 wk postpartum from a predefined list of 17 options. We used factor analysis to condense these problems into 4 explanatory variables; continuous factor scores were computed for use in further analyses. We used maximum likelihood logistic regression to assess mediation of the association between obesity and breastfeeding outcomes through early breastfeeding problems. Results: No significant effect of obesity was found on any breastfeeding at 1 or 2 mo. At 1 mo postpartum, for both primiparous and multiparous women, there was a significant direct effect of obesity on exclusive breastfeeding and a significant indirect effect of obesity through early breastfeeding problems related to the explanatory mediating variable ""Insufficient Milk"" (throughout the remainder of the Abstract, this factor will be denoted by upper case notation). At 2 mo postpartum both the direct effect of obesity and the indirect effect through Insufficient Milk were significant in primiparous women but only the indirect effect remained significant in multiparous women. Conclusions: Early problems related to Insufficient Milk may partially explain the association between obesity and poor exclusive breastfeeding outcomes. Women who are obese, particularly those reporting breastfeeding problems that grouped in the Insufficient Milk factor in the early postpartum period, may benefit from additional breastfeeding support.",,,"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/145/10/2369.full.pdf: http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed13&NEWS=N&AN=2015457225","E.J.

Ergonomic studies have identified several risk factors associated with LBDs in workplaces and developed biomechanical models for general LBD risk assessments. However, these models cannot be directly used for assessments in roof workplaces because they are designed for general tasks without considering roofers' posture variance and effects of working on slanted roof surfaces. This paper examined the relationship between roofing work-related factors and LBD risk among roofers using a laboratory assessment. A pitch-configurable wood platform was built to mimic the rooftop. The maximum trunk flexion angle and normalized electromyography (EMG) signals were measured as indicators using a motion capture system and a skeletal muscle signal recording system under different settings, i.e., different roof slopes, postures, facing directions, and working paces. The results indicated the measured factors with significant effects on the LBD development and revealed unfavorable conditions (e.g., using a stooped posture to work on low-pitch rooftops at a fast pace) where the work on rooftops needs particular attention. Such information is useful for systematic understanding of roofing nonfatal LBD developments among construction professionals and may enable development of interventions and guidelines for reducing the prevalence of LBDs at roofing jobsites.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.: 20171703607677: Construction safety: Ergonomic assessment: Experimental studies: Low back pain: Musculoskeletal disorders: Non-fatal injuries: Risk evaluation",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001320","Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, West Virginia Univ., P.O.

The objective of this study was to develop a model to estimate the change in the number and volume of open lung units as an excised lung is inflated-deflated between minimum and maximum lung volume. The model was formulated based on the observation that the compliance of the slowly changing quasi-static pressure-volume (P-V) curve of an excised rat lung can differ from the compliance of a faster changing small sinusoidal pressure volume perturbations superimposed on the curve. In those regions of the curve where differences in compliance occur, the lung tissue properties exhibit nonlinear characteristics, which cannot be linearized using ""incremental"" or ""small signal"" analysis. The model attributes the differences between the perturbation and quasi-static compliance to an additional nonlinear compliance term that results from the sequential opening and closing of lung units. Using this approach, it was possible to calculate the normalized average volume and the normalized number of open units as the lung is slowly inflated-deflated. Results indicate that the normalized average volume and the normalized number of open units are not linearly related to normalized lung volume, and at equal lung volumes the normalized number of open units is greater and the normalized average lung unit volume is smaller during lung deflation when compared to lung inflation. In summary, a model was developed to describe the recruitment-derecruitment process in excised lungs based on the differences between small signal perturbation compliance and quasi-static compliance. Values of normalized lung unit volume and the normalized number of open lung units were shown to be nonlinear functions of both transpulmonary pressure and normalized lung volume.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20130916049395: Average volume: Lung inflation: Lung mechanics: Lung tissue: Lung volume: Nonlinear characteristics: Nonlinear functions: Pressure volumes: pressure-volume loops: Quasi-static: Transpulmonary pressure: Unit volume",,,"CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States",,,,,,,,,"3 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, United States","10.1115/1.4023372"

In the current study, we analyzed the dynamic constraint loading for the thumb during pipetting. The constraint loading is considered as the loading that has to be carried by the connective tissues of the joints (i.e., the cartilage layer and the ligaments) to maintain the kinematic constraints of the system. The joint loadings are solved using a classic free-body approach, using the external loading and muscle forces, which were obtained in an inverse dynamic approach combined with an optimization procedure in anybody. The constraint forces in the thumb joint obtained in the current study are compared with those obtained in the pinch and grasp tests in a previous study (Cooney and Chao, 1977, Biomechanical Analysis of Static Forces in the Thumb During Hand Function, J. Bone Joint Surg. Am., 59(1), pp. 27-36). The maximal compression force during pipetting is approximately 83% and 60% greater than those obtained in the tip pinch and key pinch, respectively, while substantially smaller than that obtained during grasping. The maximal lateral shear force is approximately six times, 32 times, and 90% greater than those obtained in the tip pinch, key pinch, and grasp, respectively. The maximal dorsal shear force during pipetting is approximately 3.2 and 1.4 times greater than those obtained in the tip pinch and key pinch, respectively, while substantially smaller than that obtained during grasping. Our analysis indicated that the thumb joints are subjected to repetitive, intensive loading during pipetting, compared to other daily activities.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20152500947583: Biomechanical analysis: Inverse dynamic approach: Joint forces: Joint moment: Occupational activities: Optimization procedures: pipette: thumb",,,"National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, MS-2027, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown; WV, United StatesBiomechanics Laboratory, Division of Orthopedic Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester; MN, United StatesLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM), Erie; PA, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1115/1.4030311"

Because of differences in the biology and feeding habits among triatomine species, some are more likely than others to be involved in zoonotic and/or human-to-human transmission cycles of T. cruzi. In an attempt to assess the risk for Chagas disease exposure in south-central Texas, human habitations across Texas Health Service Region 8 (HSR 8) and surrounding counties were surveyed for triatomines to characterize the geographic distribution, species-specific biology, and T. cruzi-infection prevalence better. Between May 2010 and August 2013, a total of 545 triatomines representing all 5 known indigenous species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma indictiva, Triatoma lecticularia, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma protracta woodi) were collected from 59 sites across the region. Triatoma gerstaeckeri was the species most commonly found in domestic and peridomestic ecotopes across Texas HSR 8, representing over 80% of the triatomines collected. Adult T. gerstaeckeri exhibited a seasonal dispersal pattern that began in late April, peaked in mid-May, and then continued into August. On homes with available crevices in the exterior walls, adult T. gerstaeckeri were observed emerging from or entering these protective microhabitats, suggesting possible opportunistic colonization of some exterior walls compartments. Laboratory testing of triatomine hindgut contents for T. cruzi by PCR demonstrated the adult T. gerstaeckeri-infection prevalence across Texas HSR 8 to be 64%. Monitoring peridomestic adult T. gerstaeckeri over the seasonal dispersal peak demonstrated statistically significant increases in both their T. cruzi-infection prevalence (P < 0.01) and tendency to invade human dwellings (P < 0.01) in the later aspect of the emergence peak. In addition to the adult insects, variably sized and staged nymphs were recovered from the inside of 6 separate homes across Texas HSR 8. The results of this study show that T. gerstaeckeri is a widespread and common triatomine species across Texas HSR 8 and documented it to have some notable synanthropic tendencies. The high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in native triatomines, and the high frequency with which T. gerstaeckeri is recovered from human habitations, suggests that there is a risk for human exposure to T. cruzi in Texas HSR 8. Because of this, Chagas disease should be considered on the list of differential diagnoses for cases of cardiac arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, or heart failure in south-central Texas. © 2015 American Society of Parasitologists.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: JOPAA: Correspondence Address: Wozniak, E.J.; Texas Department of State Health Services, Zoonosis Control Unit, Health Service Region 8, 112 Joe Carper Drive, United States: References: Barbu, C., Dumonteil, E., Gourbiere, S., Optimization of control strategies for non-domiciliated Triatoma dimidiata, Chagas disease vector in the Yucatán peninsula, Mexico (2009) PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 3, p. e416; Beard, C.B., Pye, G., Steurer, F.J., Rodriguez, R., Campman, R., Peterson, A.T., Ramsey, J., Robinson, L.E., Chagas disease in a domestic transmission cycle in southern Texas, USA (2003) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 9, pp. 103-108; Bern, C., Yabsley, M.J., Kjos, S., Montgomery, S.P., Trypanosoma cruzi and Chagas disease in the United States (2011) Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 24, pp. 655-681; Botto-Mahan, C., Trypanosoma cruzi induces life-history changes in the wild kissing bug Mepraia spinosolar: Implications for parasite transmission (2009) Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases, 9, pp. 505-510; Cantey, P.T., Stramer, S.L., Townsend, R.L., Kamel, H., Ofafa, K., Todd, C.W., Currier, M., Dotson, E., The United States Trypanosoma cruzi infection study: Evidence for vector-borne transmission of the parasite that causes Chagas disease among United States blood donors (2012) Transfusion, 52, pp. 1922-1930; Chagas, C., Nova tripanozomiase humana: Estudos sobre a morfologia e o ciclo evolutivo do Schizotrypanum cruzi n. gen., n.

Some existing underground coal mine training focuses on rote performance of prescribed actions. For example, coal miners are taught when and how to put on self-contained self rescuers, which are respirators that provide 60 minutes of breathable air. Preparation based on inoculation theory principles differs from more traditional training in that it involves teaching trainees to think for themselves rather than simply teaching them how to perform a task or use a safety device.

Over 80% of caregivers sought care for their febrile child, however less than half did so on either the day of or the day after the development of fever. The odds of seeking care decreased with each additional month of the child's age. Caregivers living in rural areas were more likely to seek care, however were less likely to seek care promptly. Caregivers with at least a primary school education and those familiar with the protective effect of bed nets and the need to seek care promptly were more likely to seek care.

In 2013, the KNBTS National Testing Laboratory and the six regional blood transfusion centres were enrolled in the Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) programme. The process was supported by Global Communities with funding from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Methods: The SLMTA implementation at KNBTS followed the standard three-workshop series, on-site mentorships and audits. Baseline, midterm and exit audits were conducted at the seven facilities, using a standard checklist to measure progress. Given that SLMTA was designed for clinical and public health laboratories, key stakeholders, guided by Global Communities, tailored SLMTA materials to address blood transfusion services, and oriented trainers, auditors and mentors on the same. Results: The seven facilities moved from an average of zero stars at baseline to an average of three stars at the exit audit. The average baseline audit score was 38% (97 points), midterm 71% (183 points) and exit audit 79% (205 points). The Occurrence Management and Process Improvement quality system essential had the largest improvement (at 67 percentage points), from baseline to exit, whereas Facilities and Safety had the smallest improvement (at 31 percentage points). Conclusion: SLMTA can be an effective tool for preparing a blood transfusion service for accreditation. Key success factors included customising SLMTA to blood transfusion activities; sensitising trainers, mentors and auditors on operations of blood transfusion service; creating SLMTA champions in key departments; and integrating other blood transfusion-specific accreditation standards into SLMTA.","Export Date: 8 August 2017:Correspondence Address: Wakaria, E.N.; Global CommunitiesKenya; email: eric.wakaria@gmail.com:References: Vuk, T., Quality management in blood establishments (2009) ISBT Science Series, 4 (1), pp. 45-51; Strengers, P., Key elements of a blood transfusion quality management system, the tools and objectives (2011) ISBT Science Series, 6 (1), pp. 21-25. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-2824.2011.01430.x; (2008) Universal access to blood transfusion, , Geneva, Switzerland: WHO; Kenya population situation analysis [document on the Internet], , https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/admin-resource/FINALPSAREPORT_0.pdf, [cited 2017 Jan 23].

Objectives: We aimed to describe the number and proportion of laboratory tests performed in 2009 and 2011 for patients referred from HIV and non-HIV services (NHSs) in a convenience sample collected from 127 laboratories supported by PEPFAR in Tanzania. We then compared changes in the proportions of tests performed for patients referred from NHSs in 2009 vs 2011. Methods: Haematology, chemistry, tuberculosis and syphilis test data were collected from available laboratory registers. Referral sources, including HIV services, NHSs, or lack of a documented referral source, were recorded. A generalised linear mixed model reported the odds that a test was from a NHS. Results: A total of 94 132 tests from 94 laboratories in 2009 and 157 343 tests from 101 laboratories in 2011 were recorded. Half of all tests lacked a documented referral source. Tests from NHSs constituted 42% (66 084) of all tests in 2011, compared with 31% (29 181) in 2009. A test in 2011 was twice as likely to have been referred from a NHS as in 2009 (adjusted odds ratio: 2.0 [95% confidence interval: 2.0-2.1]). Conclusion: Between 2009 and 2011, the number and proportion of tests from NHSs increased across all types of test. This finding may reflect increased documentation of NHS referrals or that the laboratory scale-up originally intended to service the HIV-positive population in Tanzania may be associated with a 'spillover effect' amongst the general population.",,,"http://www.ajlmonline.org/index.php/ajlm/article/view/318/424: http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed13&NEWS=N&AN=20160282180","M.L.

PPE is a critical component in the hierarchy of controls used to protect HCWs from infectious hazards. HCW PPE may include gowns, respirators, face masks, gloves, eye protection, face shields, and head and shoe coverings. Important research has been conducted in certain areas, such as respirators and protective masks, but studies in other areas, particularly gowns, are scarce. Gowns are identified as the second-most-used piece of PPE, following gloves, in the healthcare setting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Guideline for Isolation Precautions, isolation gowns should be worn to protect HCWs arms and exposed body areas during procedures and patient-care activities when anticipating contact with clothing, blood, bodily fluids, secretions and excretions. Isolation gowns currently available on the marketplace offer varying resistance to blood and other bodily fluids depending on the type of the material, its impermeability, and wear and tear. While some studies show no benefit of the routine use of isolation gowns, others demonstrate that its use is associated with a reduced infection rate. This paper reviews isolation gowns in healthcare settings, including the fabrics used, gown design and interfaces, as well as critical parameters that affect microorganism and liquid transmission through fabrics.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20153701255980: Centers for disease control and preventions: Critical component: Emerging infectious disease: Healthcare workers: Isolation gown: Pandemic influenza: Personal protective equipment: Protective masks",,"http://www.jeffjournal.org/papers/Volume10/V10I3(20)%20F.%20Kilinc.pdf","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, NIOSH/National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, 626 Cochrans Mill Road Bld: T403 P.O.

Many people with diabetes have a variety of diabetes-related complications. Among the variety of conditions associated with diabetes, however, liver diseases are less well recognized. As such, we aimed to describe chronic liver disease (CLD)-associated hospitalization rates among U.S. adults with diabetes from 2001–2012. Methods. We used a nationally representative database of hospitalizations, the National Inpatient Sample, to determine CLD-associated hospitalization rates among U.S. adults aged ?18 years with and without diabetes, from 2001–2012. Hospitalizations listing an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for CLD on the discharge record were selected for analysis and were further classified by diabetes status based on concurrent presence of a diabetes ICD-9-CM code. We calculated average annual age-adjusted hospitalization rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and conducted a test for trend. Results. For 2001–2012, the total age-adjusted CLD-associated hospitalization rate among adults with diabetes (1,680.9 per 100,000 population; 95% CI 1,577.2, 1,784.6) was approximately four times the rate of adults without diabetes (424.2 per 100,000 population; 95% CI 413.4, 435.1). Total age-adjusted hospitalization rates of adults with and without diabetes increased 59% and 48%, respectively, from 2001–2002 to 2011–2012 (p<0.001). Hepatitis C- and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis-associated hospitalizations comprised the largest proportion of total CLD-associated hospitalizations among adults with and without diabetes. Conclusion. Providers should be aware of the potential existence of CLD among adults with diabetes and counsel patients on preventive methods to avoid progressive liver damage. © 2015 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Byrd, K.K.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd.

We estimated the prevalence of preventive aspirin and/or other antiplatelet medication use and the dosage of aspirin use in the U.S. adult population. Methods. We conducted cross-sectional analyses of a representative sample (n=3,599) of U.S. adults aged ? 40 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011–2012. Results. In 2011–2012, one-third of U.S. adults aged ? 40 years reported taking preventive aspirin and/or other antiplatelet medications, 97% of whom indicated preventive aspirin use. Preventive aspirin use increased with age (from 11% of those aged 40–49 years to 54% of those ? 80 years of age, P=0.001). Non-Hispanic white (35%) and black (30%) adults were more likely to take preventive aspirin than non-Hispanic Asian (20%, p,0.001) and Hispanic (22%, p=0.013) adults. Adults with, compared with those without health insurance, and adults with ?2 doctor visits in the past year, diagnosed diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol were twice as likely to take preventive aspirin. Among those with cardiovascular disease, 76% reported taking preventive aspirin and/or other antiplatelet medications, of whom 91% were taking preventive aspirin. Among adults without cardiovascular disease, 28% reported taking preventive aspirin. Adherence rates to medically recommended aspirin use were 82% overall, 91% for secondary prevention, and 79% for primary prevention. Among current preventive aspirin users, 70% were taking 81 milligrams (mg) of aspirin daily and 13% were taking 325 mg of aspirin daily. Conclusion. The vast majority of antiplatelet therapy is preventive aspirin use. A health-care provider’s recommendation to take preventive aspirin is an important determinant of current preventive aspirin use. © 2015 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Gu, Q.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, 3311 Toledo Rd., United States: References: George, M.G., Tong, X., Sonnenfeld, N., Hong, Y., Recommended use of aspirin and other antiplatelet medications among adults—National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambula­tory Medical Care Survey, United States, 2005–2008 (2012) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 61, pp. 11-18; Smith, S.C., Jr., Benjamin, E.J., Bonow, R.O., Braun, L.T., Creager, M.A., Franklin, B.A., AHA/ACCF Secondary Prevention and Risk Reduction Therapy for Patients with Coronary and Other Ath­erosclerotic Vascular Disease: 2011 update: A guideline from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Foundation (2011) Circulation, 124, pp. 2458-2473; Furie, K.L., Kasner, S.E., Adams, R.J., Albers, G.W., Bush, R.L., Fagan, S.C., Guidelines for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack: A guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (2011) Stroke, 42, pp. 227-276; Park, K., Bavry, A.A., Aspirin: Its risks, benefits, and optimal use in preventing cardiovascular events (2013) Cleve Clin J Med, 80, pp. 318-326; Lewis, H.D., Jr., Davis, J.W., Archibald, D.G., Steinke, W.E., Smitherman, T.C., Doherty, J.E., III, Protective effects of aspirin against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina.

However, 20% of U.S. cases do not have an isolate for testing, and 10% of cases with isolates do not have a genotype reported. TB outbreaks in populations with incomplete genotyping data might be missed by genotyping-based outbreak detection. Therefore, we assessed the representativeness of TB genotyping data by comparing characteristics of cases reported during January 1, 2009–December 31, 2010, that had a genotype result with those cases that did not. Of 22,476 cases, 14,922 (66%) had a genotype result. Cases without genotype results were more likely to be patients ,19 years of age, with unknown HIV status, of female sex, U.S.-born, and with no recent history of homelessness or substance abuse. Although cases with a genotype result are largely representative of all reported U.S. TB cases, outbreak detection methods that rely solely on genotyping data may underestimate TB transmission among certain groups. © 2015 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: France, A.M.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, 1600 Clifton Rd.

Twelve health departments in cities with high AIDS burden participated. These 12 grantees submitted plans detailing jurisdiction-level goals, strategies, and objectives for HIV prevention and care activities. We reviewed plans to identify themes in the planning process and initial implementation. Planning themes included data integration, broad engagement of partners, and resource allocation modeling. Implementation themes included organizational change, building partnerships, enhancing data use, developing protocols and policies, and providing training and technical assistance for new and expanded activities. Pilot programs also allowed grantees to assess the feasibility of large-scale implementation. These findings indicate that health departments in areas hardest hit by HIV are shifting their HIV prevention and care programs to increase local impact. Examples from ECHPP will be of interest to other health departments as they work toward meeting the NHAS goals. © 2016 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","Cited By :3: Export Date: 15 January 2016: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Flores, S.A.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd.

Health departments in 12 U.S. cities with a high prevalence of AIDS conducted comprehensive program planning and implemented cost-effective, scalable HIV prevention interventions that targeted high-risk populations. We examined trends in health department HIV prevention programs in these cities during the project. METHODS: We analyzed the number of people who received partner services, condoms distributed, and people tested for HIV, as well as funding allocations for selected HIV prevention programs by year and by site from October 2010 through September 2013. We assessed trends in the proportional change in services and allocations during the project period using generalized estimating equations. We also conducted thematic coding of program activities that targeted people living with HIV infection (PLWH). RESULTS: We found significant increases in funding allocations for HIV testing and condom distribution. All HIV partner services indicators, condom distribution, and HIV testing of African American and Hispanic/Latino populations significantly increased. HIV tests associated with a new diagnosis increased significantly among those self-identifying as Hispanic/Latino but significantly decreased among African Americans. For programs targeting PLWH, health department activities included implementing new program models, improving local data use, and building local capacity to enhance linkage to HIV medical care, retention in care, and treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings indicate that health departments in areas with a high burden of AIDS successfully shifted their HIV prevention resources to scale up important HIV programs and make progress toward NHAS goals. © 2016 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.","Cited By :3: Export Date: 15 January 2016: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Fisher, H.H.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd.

Transcripts from admission chest radiographs could aid in identification of pneumonia cases for public health surveillance. We assessed the reliability of radiographic data abstraction and performance of radiographic key terms to identify pneumonia in patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. Methods. We used data on patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection from October 2008 through December 2009 from 10 geographically diverse U.S. study sites participating in the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). Radiographic key terms (i.e., bronchopneumonia, consolidation, infiltrate, airspace density, and pleural effusion) were abstracted from final impressions of chest radiograph reports. We assessed the reliability of radiographic data abstraction by examining the percent agreement and Cohen’s ? statistic between clinicians and surveillance staff members. Using a composite reference standard for presence or absence of pneumonia based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and discharge summary data, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and percent agreement for individual and combined radiographic key terms. Results. For each radiographic key term, the percent agreement between clinicians and surveillance staff members ranged from 89.4% to 98.6% and Cohen’s ? ranged from 0.46 (moderate) to 0.84 (almost perfect). The combination of bronchopneumonia or consolidation or infiltrate or airspace density terms had sensitivity of 66.5%, specificity of 89.2%, PPV of 80.4%, and percent agreement of 80.1%. Adding pleural effusion did not result in significant changes in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or percent agreement. Conclusion. Radiographic key terms abstracted by surveillance staff members from final impressions of chest radiograph reports had moderate to almost perfect reliability and could be used to identify pneumonia among patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. This method can inform pneumonia surveillance and aid in public health response.","Export Date: 13 May 2016: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Bramley, A.M.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Influenza Division, 1600 Clifton Rd.

We explored parent-reported reasons for their children’s non-completion of the HPV vaccine series using a nationally representative online survey of parents of children aged 9–17 years, fielded in October 2012. Among the 1,653 parents who responded, the proportion reporting that their child would definitely continue with the HPV vaccine series among those who had started the series ranged from 28% to 54%. The most common reason cited by parents for non-completion of the series was their child’s fear of needles, followed by lack of awareness about additional doses and safety concerns. These findings demonstrate the need to encourage adoption of strategies addressing needle fears, utilize reminders for parents about subsequent doses, and emphasize recent HPV vaccine safety data in discussions with parents.","Export Date: 13 May 2016: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Clark, S.J.; University of Michigan, Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit, 300 North Ingalls, 6E06, United States; email: saclark@umich.edu: References: Markowitz, L.E., Dunne, E.F., Saraiya, M., Lawson, H.W., Chesson, H., Unger, E.R., Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (2007) MMWR Recomm Rep, 56 (RR-2), pp. 1-24; Dunne, E.F., Markowitz, L.E., Chesson, H., Curtis, C.R., Saraiya, M., Gee, J., Recommendations on the use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in males—Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2011 (2011) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 60 (50), pp. 1705-1708; (2015) Birth–18 Years & “catch-up” Immunization Schedules, , http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/child-adolescent.html, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US), United States; Elam-Evans, L.D., Yankey, D., Jeyarajah, J., Singleton, J.A., Curtin, C.R., Macneil, J., National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years—United States, 2013 (2014) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 63 (29), pp. 625-633; Holman, D.M., Benard, V., Roland, K.B., Watson, M., Liddon, N., Stokley, S., Barriers to human papillomavirus vaccination among US adolescents: A systematic review of the literature (2014) JAMA Pediatr, 168, pp. 76-82; Curtis, C.R., Dorell, C., Yankey, D., Jeyarajah, J., Chesson, H., Saraiya, M., National human papillomavirus vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years—National Immunization Survey–Teen, United States, 2011 (2014) MMWR Recomm Rep, 63 (RR-2), pp. 61-70; Gold, R., Naleway, A., Riedlinger, K., Factors predicting completion of the human papillomavirus vaccine series (2013) J Adolesc Health, 52, pp. 427-432; Rahman, M., Laz, T.H., McGrath, C.J., Berenson, A.B., Provider recommendation mediates the relationship between parental human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and HPV vaccine initiation and completion among 13- to 17-year-old US adolescent children (2015) Clin Pediatr (Phila), 54, pp. 371-375; (2013) KnowledgePanel® Design Summary, , http://www.knowledgenetworks.com/knpanel/docs/knowledgepanel(R)-design-summary-description.pdf, GfK, Palo Alto (CA): GfK; Dempsey, A.F., Singer, D., Clark, S.J., Davis, M.M., Parents’ views on 3 shot-related visits: Implications for use of adolescent vaccines like human papillomavirus vaccine (2009) Acad Pediatr, 9, pp. 348-352; Gowda, C., Carlos, R.C., Butchart, A.T., Singer, D.C., Davis, M.M., Clark, S.J., CHIAS: A standardized measure of parental HPV immunization attitudes and beliefs and its associations with vaccine uptake (2012) Sex Transm Dis, 39, pp. 475-481; http://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/nifs-estimates-nov2013.htm, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Immunization Services Division.

Many cardiovascular deaths can be avoided through primary prevention to address cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors or better access to quality medical care. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between four county-level health factors and rates of avoidable death from CVD during 2006–2010. Methods. We defined avoidable deaths from CVD as deaths among U.S. residents younger than 75 years of age caused by the following underlying conditions, using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes: ischemic heart disease (I20–I25), chronic rheumatic heart disease (I05–I09), hypertensive disease (I10–I15), or cerebrovascular disease (I60–I69). We stratified county-level death rates by race (non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black) and age-standardized them to the 2000 U.S. standard population. We used County Health Rankings data to rank county-level z scores corresponding to four health factors: health behavior, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. We used Poisson rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare rates of avoidable death from CVD by health-factor quartile. Results. In a comparison of worst-ranked and best-ranked counties, social and economic factors had the strongest association with rates of avoidable death per 100,000 population from CVD for the total population (RR51.49; 95% CI 1.39, 1.60) and for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic white: RR51.37; 95% CI 1.29, 1.45; non-Hispanic black: RR51.54; 95% CI 1.42, 1.67). Among the non-Hispanic white population, health behaviors had the next strongest association, followed by clinical care. Among the non-Hispanic black population, we observed a significant association with clinical care and physical environment in a comparison of worst-ranked and best-ranked counties. Conclusion. Social and economic factors have the strongest association with rates of avoidable death from CVD by county, which reinforces the importance of social and economic interventions to address geographic disparities in avoidable deaths from CVD.","Export Date: 13 May 2016: CODEN: PHRPA: Correspondence Address: Greer, S.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, 4770 Buford Hwy.

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance systems monitor morbidity, mortality, and vaccine impact; accurate surveillance is important to detect changes in epidemiology. We evaluated completeness of IPD reporting in New Mexico by comparing data from the Hospital Inpatient Discharge Database (HIDD) and the New Mexico Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) program. Methods. We linked data from the HIDD and the ABCs program. We defined cases of IPD in the HIDD among New Mexico residents with hospitalizations during 2007–2009 as specific (320.1 or 038.2) or nonspecific (481, 320.2, or 041.2) using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. To validate if HIDD records that could not be matched to ABCs data were true IPD cases, we reviewed laboratory data and determined if Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) had been isolated from a sterile body site. Results. We examined 732 HIDD records for cases that were not matched in the ABCs database; of such records, S. pneumoniae was isolated from a sterile body site in 10 HIDD records. Conclusion. ABCs data detected the majority of IPD cases in New Mexico. Laboratory and medical record review is essential when using HIDD data because ICD-9-CM coding alone does not ensure data accuracy. The addition of IPD cases to the ABCs program from the HIDD was minimally beneficial to active surveillance and reporting completeness in New Mexico. States that rely exclusively on passive reporting and that have access to HIDD data might use linkages of pneumococcal and IPD-specific ICD-9-CM–coded HIDD data to improve IPD surveillance and case ascertainment. © 2016, Association of Schools of Public Health.

Strengthened clinical research capacity can advance national health goals by supporting greater autonomy in aligning research with national priorities. From March through June 2010, we assessed six elements of clinical research capacity in Vietnam: research agenda; clinical investigators and biostatisticians; donors and sponsors; community involvement; scientific, ethical, safety, and quality oversight; and clinical research institutions. Assessments were drawn from interviews with investigators, Ministry of Health staff members, nongovernment organizations, and U.S. Mission staff members, and document review. Observations and recommendations were shared with collaborators. Reassessment in 2015 found growth in the number of clinical trials, improved regulation in human subjects protection and community engagement, and modest advances in research agenda setting. Training and investment in institutions remain challenging. A framework for assessing clinical research capacity can affirm strengths and weaknesses and guide the coordination of capacity-building efforts. © 2016, Association of Schools of Public Health.

Key within the effort to strengthen health systems is the development of a well-prepared, skilled, and knowledgeable public health workforce. Over 60 years ago, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began the first training program in applied epidemiology, the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), a two-year, in-service training program in epidemiology and public health practice. Since 1951, the EIS has produced well-trained and highly qualified applied or field epidemiologists, many of whom later became leaders within the US public health system. In 1980, the CDC began assisting other countries to develop their own field epidemiology training programs (FETPs), modeling them after the highly successful EIS program. FETPs differ from other training programs in epidemiology in that: (1) they are positioned within Ministries of Health and the activities of the residents are designed to address the priority health issues of the Ministry; (2) they stress the principle of training through service; and (3) they provide close supervision and mentoring by trained field epidemiologists. While FETPs are designed to be adaptable to the needs of any given country, there exist many fundamental similarities in the skills and knowledge required by public health workers. Recognizing this, CDC developed a standard core FETP curriculum that can be adapted to any country's needs. Countries can further customize FETP trainings to meet their specific needs by adding specialized - tracks - or by targeting different audiences and levels of the health system. Although FETPs require substantial investments in time and resources as well as significant commitment from ministries, CDC's vision is that every country will have access to an FETP to help build its public health workforce and strengthen its public health systems.","Author Affiliation: Division of Public Health Systems and Workforce Development, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MS E-93, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.: Author Email: PBloland@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v3iss47_Authors_Schneider.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Brussels",

Grantees were required to improve their planning and implementation of HIV prevention and care programs to increase their impact on local HIV epidemics. A multilevel evaluation using multiple data sources, spanning multiple years (2008–2015), will be conducted to assess the effect of ECHPP on client outcomes (e.g., HIV risk behaviors) and impact indicators (e.g., new HIV diagnoses). METHODS: We designed an evaluation approach that includes a broad assessment of program planning and implementation, a detailed examination of HIV prevention and care activities across funding sources, and an analysis of environmental and contextual factors that may affect services. A data triangulation approach was incorporated to integrate findings across all indicators and data sources to determine the extent to which ECHPP contributed to trends in indicators. RESULTS: To date, data have been collected for 2008–2009 (pre-ECHPP implementation) and 2010–2013 (ECHPP period). Initial analysis of process data indicate the ECHPP grantees increased their provision of HIV testing, condom distribution, and partner services programs and expanded their delivery of prevention programs for people diagnosed with HIV. CONCLUSION: The ECHPP evaluation (2008–2015) will assess whether ECHPP programmatic activities in 12 areas with high AIDS prevalence contributed to changes in client outcomes, and whether these changes were associated with changes in longer-term, community-level impact.","Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

Health departments in 12 U.S. cities with a high prevalence of AIDS conducted comprehensive program planning and implemented cost-effective, scalable HIV prevention interventions that targeted high-risk populations. We examined trends in health department HIV prevention programs in these cities during the project. METHODS: We analyzed the number of people who received partner services, condoms distributed, and people tested for HIV, as well as funding allocations for selected HIV prevention programs by year and by site from October 2010 through September 2013. We assessed trends in the proportional change in services and allocations during the project period using generalized estimating equations. We also conducted thematic coding of program activities that targeted people living with HIV infection (PLWH). RESULTS: We found significant increases in funding allocations for HIV testing and condom distribution. All HIV partner services indicators, condom distribution, and HIV testing of African American and Hispanic/Latino populations significantly increased. HIV tests associated with a new diagnosis increased significantly among those self-identifying as Hispanic/Latino but significantly decreased among African Americans. For programs targeting PLWH, health department activities included implementing new program models, improving local data use, and building local capacity to enhance linkage to HIV medical care, retention in care, and treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings indicate that health departments in areas with a high burden of AIDS successfully shifted their HIV prevention resources to scale up important HIV programs and make progress toward NHAS goals.","Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

To assess the impact of BMI on HRQOL and mortality, we compared quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) by BMI levels. METHODS: We obtained HRQOL data from the 1993–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and life table estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics national mortality files to estimate QALE among U.S. adults by BMI categories: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m2), obese (BMI 30.0–34.9 kg/m2), and severely obese (BMI >/=35.0 kg/m2). RESULTS: In 2010 in the United States, the highest estimated QALE for adults at 18 years of age was 54.1 years for individuals classified as normal weight. The two lowest QALE estimates were for those classified as either underweight (48.9 years) or severely obese (48.2 years). For individuals who were overweight or obese, the QALE estimates fell between those classified as either normal weight (54.1 years) or severely obese (48.2 years). The difference in QALE between adults classified as normal weight and those classified as either overweight or obese was significantly higher among women than among men, irrespective of race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Using population-based data, we found significant differences in QALE loss by BMI category. These findings are valuable for setting national and state targets to reduce health risks associated with severe obesity, and could be used for cost-effectiveness evaluations of weight-reduction interventions.","Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

An early case capture (ECC) surveillance program was piloted in seven state cancer registries to register pediatric cancer cases within 30 days of diagnosis. We sought to determine the quality of ECC data and understand pilot implementation. METHODS: We used quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate ECC. We assessed data quality by comparing demographic and clinical characteristics from the initial ECC submission to a resubmission of ECC pilot data and to the most recent year of routinely collected cancer data for each state individually and in aggregate. We conducted telephone focus groups with registry staff to determine ECC practices and difficulties in August and September 2013. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded to identify themes. RESULTS: Comparing ECC initial submissions with submissions for all states, ECC data were nationally representative for age (9.7 vs. 9.9 years) and sex (673 of 1,324 [50.9%] vs. 42,609 of 80,547 [52.9%] male cases), but not for primary site (472 of 1,324 [35.7%] vs. 27,547 of 80,547 [34.2%] leukemia/lymphoma cases), behavior (1,219 of 1,324 [92.1%] vs. 71,525 of 80,547 [88.8%] malignant cases), race/ethnicity (781 of 1,324 [59.0%] vs. 64,518 of 80,547 [80.1%] white cases), or diagnostic confirmation (1,233 of 1,324 [93.2%] vs. 73,217 of 80,547 [90.9%] microscopically confirmed cases). When comparing initial ECC data with resubmission data, differences were seen in race/ethnicity (808 of 1,324 [61.1%] vs. 1,425 of 1,921 [74.2%] white cases), primary site (475 of 1,324 [35.9%] vs. 670 of 1,921 [34.9%] leukemia/lymphoma cases), and behavior (1,215 of 1,324 [91.8%] vs. 1,717 of 1,921 [89.4%] malignant cases). Common themes from focus group analysis included implementation challenges and facilitators, benefits of ECC, and utility of ECC data. CONCLUSIONS: ECC provided data rapidly and reflected national data overall with differences in several data elements.

In concert with the release of NHAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched an initiative to fund 12 health departments to redesign programmatic efforts to help achieve the goals of NHAS by implementing CDC’s new High Impact Prevention (HIP) approach to HIV. The Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Planning (ECHPP) project involved implementing a wide range of high-impact HIV prevention activities in the 12 cities with the highest prevalence of AIDS, which represented 44% of total cases nationwide reported through 2007. An underlying assumption in CDC’s HIP approach, and in NHAS, is that HIV prevention resources needed to be better targeted to have a greater population impact. The task for ECHPP projects was to show that health departments could successfully shift their resources to different areas, populations, and interventions and, in doing so, have a greater impact on HIV in their jurisdictions.","Accession Number: 112027239.

METHODS: We analyzed 2003–2010 National Health Interview Survey data to estimate annual national percentages of people aged 18–64 years who were tested for HIV in the previous 12 months. Estimates were calculated by setting (publicly funded, yes/other) and stratified by sex. Test settings were categorized as publicly funded based on the contribution of public funds for HIV testing. We used logistic regression modeling to assess statistical significance in linear trends for 2003–2006 and 2006–2010, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and health insurance coverage. Using model parameters for survey year, we calculated the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in HIV testing as the difference in the model-predicted testing prevalence between baseline and first post-baseline years, divided by baseline prevalence. RESULTS: During 2006–2010, the percentage of women tested for HIV in publicly funded settings increased significantly from 1.9% in 2006 to 2.4% in 2010 (EAPC=6.9%, p=0.008) and the percentage tested in other settings remained fairly stable, from 9.7% in 2006 to 9.6% in 2010 (EAPC=-0.5%, p=0.708). During the same period, the percentage of men tested for HIV in publicly funded settings increased, but not significantly, from 1.5% in 2006 to 1.9% in 2010 (EAPC=5.3%, p=0.110) and the percentage tested in other settings decreased significantly from 7.5% in 2006 to 6.2% in 2010 (EAPC=-4.4%, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Although HIV testing in publicly funded settings increased among women during 2006–2010, testing rates remained low, and no similar increase occurred among men. As such, all test settings should increase HIV screening, particularly for men.","Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

ACIP recommends routine vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) for adolescents aged 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. ACIP also recommends routine vaccination with MenACWY for persons aged ?2 months at increased risk for meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, W, or Y, including persons who have persistent complement component deficiencies; persons receiving a complement inhibitor (e.g., eculizumab [Soliris] or ravulizumab [Ultomiris]); persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia; persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection; microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis; persons identified to be at increased risk because of a meningococcal disease outbreak caused by serogroups A, C, W, or Y; persons who travel to or live in areas in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic; unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated first-year college students living in residence halls; and military recruits. ACIP recommends MenACWY booster doses for previously vaccinated persons who become or remain at increased risk. In addition, ACIP recommends routine use of MenB vaccine series among persons aged ?10 years who are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease, including persons who have persistent complement component deficiencies; persons receiving a complement inhibitor; persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia; microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis; and persons identified to be at increased risk because of a meningococcal disease outbreak caused by serogroup B. ACIP recommends MenB booster doses for previously vaccinated persons who become or remain at increased risk. In addition, ACIP recommends a MenB series for adolescents and young adults aged 16-23 years on the basis of shared clinical decision-making to provide short-term protection against disease caused by most strains of serogroup B N. meningitidis.","Public Health; USA.

Japanese encephalitis vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep 2010;59[No. RR-1]). The report summarizes the epidemiology of JE, describes the JE vaccine that is licensed and available in the United States, and provides recommendations for its use among travelers and laboratory workers. JE virus, a mosquitoborne flavivirus, is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia. JE occurs throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific. Approximately 20%--30% of patients die, and 30%--50% of survivors have neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral sequelae. No antiviral treatment is available. Inactivated Vero cell culture--derived JE vaccine (Ixiaro [JE-VC]) is the only JE vaccine that is licensed and available in the United States. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed JE-VC for use in persons aged >/=17 years; in 2013, licensure was extended to include children aged >/=2 months. Most travelers to countries where the disease is endemic are at very low risk for JE. However, some travelers are at increased risk for infection on the basis of their travel plans. Factors that increase the risk for JE virus exposure include 1) traveling for a longer period; 2) travel during the JE virus transmission season; 3) spending time in rural areas; 4) participating in extensive outdoor activities; and 5) staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets. All travelers to countries where JE is endemic should be advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites to reduce the risk for JE and other vectorborne diseases. For some persons who might be at increased risk for JE, the vaccine can further reduce the risk for infection. The decision about whether to vaccinate should be individualized and consider the 1) risks related to the specific travel itinerary, 2) likelihood of future travel to countries where JE is endemic, 3) high morbidity and mortality of JE, 4) availability of an effective vaccine, 5) possibility (but low probability) of serious adverse events after vaccination, and 6) the traveler's personal perception and tolerance of risk. JE vaccine is recommended for persons moving to a JE-endemic country to take up residence, longer-term (e.g., >/=1 month) travelers to JE-endemic areas, and frequent travelers to JE-endemic areas. JE vaccine also should be considered for shorter-term (e.g., <1 month) travelers with an increased risk for JE on the basis of planned travel duration, season, location, activities, and accommodations and for travelers to JE-endemic areas who are uncertain about their specific travel duration, destinations, or activities. JE vaccine is not recommended for travelers with very low-risk itineraries, such as shorter-term travel limited to urban areas or outside of a well-defined JE virus transmission season.","Public Health; USA.

Across 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 4 territories, a final list of 620 unique conditions was compiled. No single condition was listed by all jurisdictions. Hearing impairment was the condition listed by the most states (n = 38), followed by fetal alcohol syndrome (n = 34). Of the 620 conditions, 168 (27%) were listed by only 1 state, 554 (89%) were listed by fewer than 10 states, and 66 (11%) were listed by 10 or more states.

The MMP population was demographically similar to all PLWH in NHSS, except it tended to be slightly older, HIV diagnosed more recently, and to have AIDS.

Historically, measles case-fatality ratios (CFRs) have been reported to vary from 0.1% in the developed world to as high as 30% in emergency settings. Estimates of the global burden of mortality from measles, critical to prioritizing measles vaccination among other health interventions, are highly sensitive to the CFR estimates used in modeling; however, due to the lack of reliable, up-to-date data, considerable debate exists as to what CFR estimates are appropriate to use. To determine current measles CFRs in high-burden settings without vital registration we have conducted six retrospective measles mortality studies in such settings. This paper examines the methodological challenges of this work and our solutions to these challenges, including the integration of lessons from retrospective all-cause mortality studies into CFR studies, approaches to laboratory confirmation of outbreaks, and means of obtaining a representative sample of case-patients. Our experiences are relevant to those conducting retrospective CFR studies for measles or other diseases, and to those interested in all-cause mortality studies.","Author Affiliation: Global Immunization Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd, MS E-05, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.: Author Email: kfc4@cdc.gov",,"http://www.ete-online.com/content/pdf/1742-7622-7-4.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","London","10.1186/1742-7622-7-4"

However, at present, there is common uncertainty about how to accomplish this task. Specifically, several nations are faced with an immense challenge of revamping an entire system. To accomplish this, it is essential to first identify the components of the system that require modification. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed health system building blocks, which are now widely recognized as essential components of health systems strengthening. With increased travel and urbanization, the threat of emerging diseases of pandemic potential is increasing alongside endemic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and hepatitis virus infections. At the same time, the epidemiologic patterns are shifting, giving rise to a concurrent increase in disease burden due to non-communicable diseases. These diseases can be addressed by public health surveillance and response systems that are operated by competent public health workers in core public health positions at national and sub-national levels with a focus on disease prevention. We describe two ways that health ministries in developing countries could leverage President Obama's Global Health Initiative (GHI) to build public health surveillance and response systems using proven models for public health systems strengthening and to create the public health workforce to operate those systems. We also offer suggestions for how health ministries could strengthen public health systems within the broad health systems strengthening agenda. Existing programs (e.g., the Global Vaccine Alliance [GAVI] and the Global Fund Against Tuberculosis, AIDS, and Malaria [GFTAM]) can also adapt their current health systems strengthening programs to build sustainable public health systems.","Author Affiliation: Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program and Systems (Africa) Branch, Division of Public Health Systems and Workforce Development, Center for Global Health, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.: Author Email: pcn0@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v2iss50_Authors_Nsubuga.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","London","10.1186/1471-2458-10-s1-s5"

The International Health Regulations (IHR[2005]) offer one of these strategic themes whereby World Health Organization (WHO) Member States and global partners engaged in biosecurity, biosurveillance and public health can define commonalities and leverage their respective missions and resources to optimize interventions. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Cooperative Biologica Engagement Program (CBEP) works with partner countries across clinical, veterinary, epidemiological, and laboratory communities to enhance national disease surveillance, detection, diagnostic, and reporting capabilities. CBEP, like many other capacity building programs, has wrestled with ways to improve partner country buy-in and ownership and to develop sustainable solutions that impact integrated disease surveillance outcomes. Designing successful implementation strategies represents a complex and challenging exercise and requires robust and transparent collaboration at the country level. To address this challenge, the Laboratory Systems Development Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CBEP have partnered to create a set of tools that brings together key leadership of the surveillance system into a deliberate system design process. This process takes into account strengths and limitations of the existing system, how the components inter-connect and relate to one another, and how they can be systematically refined within the local context. The planning tools encourage cross-disciplinary thinking, critical evaluation and analysis of existing capabilities, and discussions across organizational and departmental lines toward a shared course of action and purpose.

Development of national standards will facilitate data aggregation and utilization across birth defects surveillance programs in the U.S. METHODS: Based on national standards for other U.S. public health surveillance programs, existing National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) guidelines for conducting birth defects surveillance, and information from birth defects surveillance programs regarding their current data quality practices, we developed 11 data quality measures that focused on data completeness (n=5 measures), timeliness (n=2), and accuracy (n=4). For each measure, we established tri-level performance criteria (1=rudimentary, 2=essential, 3=optimal). In January 2014, we sent birth defects surveillance programs in each state, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the U.S. Department of Defense Birth and Infant Health Registry an invitation to complete a self-administered NBDPN Standards Data Quality Assessment Tool. The completed forms were electronically submitted to the CDC for analyses. RESULTS: Of 47 eligible population-based surveillance programs, 45 submitted a completed assessment tool. Two of the 45 programs did not meet minimum inclusion criteria and were excluded; thus, the final analysis included information from 43 programs. Average scores for four of the five completeness performance measures were above level 2. Conversely, the average scores for both timeliness measures and three of the four accuracy measures were below level 2. Surveillance programs using an active case-finding approach scored higher than programs using passive case-finding approaches for the completeness and accuracy measures, whereas their average scores were lower for timeliness measures. CONCLUSIONS: This initial, nation-wide assessment of data quality across U.S. population-based birth defects surveillance programs highlights areas for improvement. Using this information to identify strengths and weaknesses, the birth defects surveillance community, working through the NBDPN, can enhance and implement a consistent set of standards that can promote uniformity and enable surveillance programs to work towards improving the potential of these programs.","Export Date: 1 October 2015 No PubMed Found: Correspondence Address: Anderka, M.; Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 250 Washington St, United States: References: Update on overall prevalence of major birth defects - Atlanta, Georgia, 1978-2005 (2008) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 57 (1), pp. 1-5. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Mathews, T.J., MacDorman, M.F., (2013) Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2010 Period Linked Birth/infant Death Data Set, p. 8. , National Vital Statistics Reports 62 National Center for Health Statistics Hyattsville, MD; Watkins, M.L., Edmonds, L., McClearn, A., Mullins, L., Mulinare, J., Khoury, M., The surveillance of birth defects: The usefulness of the revised US standard birth certificate (1996) Am J Public Health, 86 (5), pp. 731-734. , 1380486 1:STN:280:DyaK283ht1eksA%3D%3D 8629729; Kirby, R.S., The quality of the data reported on birth certificates [Letter] (1997) Am J of Public Health, 8 (2), p. 301; Boulet, S.L., Shin, M., Kirby, R.S., Goodman, D., Correa, A., Sensitivity of birth certificate reports of birth defects in Atlanta, 1995-2005: Effects of maternal, infant, and hospital characteristics (2011) Public Health Rep, 126 (2), pp. 186-194. , 3056031 21387948; Congenital Malformation Surveillance Report: A report from the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (2013) Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, 97, p. 10. , NBDPN; Canfield, M.A., Honein, M.A., Yuskiv, N., Xing, J., Mai, C.T., Collins, J.S., Devine, O., Kirby, R.S., National estimates and race/ethnic-specific variation of selected birth defects in the United States, 1999-2001 (2006) Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, 76, pp. 747-756. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28Xht1GrtL7I 17051527; Parker, S.E., Mai, C.T., Canfield, M.A., Rickard, R., Wang, Y., Meyer, R.E., Anderson, P., Correa, A., Updated national birth prevalence estimates for selected birth defects in the United States, 2004-2006 (2010) Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, 88 (12), pp. 1008-1016. , for the National Birth Defects Prevention Network 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXhsFGkurnP 20878909; Hetzel, A.M., (1997) History and Organization of the Vital Statistics System, , National center for health statistics; Wingo, P.A., Jamison, P.M., Hiatt, R.A., Weir, H.K., Gargiullo, P.M., Hutton, M., Lee, N.C., Hall, H.I., Building the infrastructure for nationwide cancer surveillance and control - A comparison between the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (United States) (2003) Cancer Causes Control, 14 (2), pp. 175-193. , 12749723; (2004) Guidelines for Conducting Birth Defects Surveillance, , National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) Sever, LE, ed.

Slow parasite clearance is a key clinical manifestation of reduced susceptibility to artemisinin. This study was designed to establish the baseline values for clearance in patients from Sub-Saharan African countries with uncomplicated malaria treated with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). METHODS: A literature review in PubMed was conducted in March 2013 to identify all prospective clinical trials (uncontrolled trials, controlled trials and randomized controlled trials), including ACTs conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, between 1960 and 2012. Individual patient data from these studies were shared with the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) and pooled using an a priori statistical analytical plan. Factors affecting early parasitological response were investigated using logistic regression with study sites fitted as a random effect. The risk of bias in included studies was evaluated based on study design, methodology and missing data. RESULTS: In total, 29,493 patients from 84 clinical trials were included in the analysis, treated with artemether-lumefantrine (n = 13,664), artesunate-amodiaquine (n = 11,337) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n = 4,492). The overall parasite clearance rate was rapid. The parasite positivity rate (PPR) decreased from 59.7 % (95 % CI: 54.5-64.9) on day 1 to 6.7 % (95 % CI: 4.8-8.7) on day 2 and 0.9 % (95 % CI: 0.5-1.2) on day 3. The 95th percentile of observed day 3 PPR was 5.3 %. Independent risk factors predictive of day 3 positivity were: high baseline parasitaemia (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.16 (95 % CI: 1.08-1.25); per 2-fold increase in parasite density, P <0.001); fever (>37.5 degreeC) (AOR = 1.50 (95 % CI: 1.06-2.13), P = 0.022); severe anaemia (AOR = 2.04 (95 % CI: 1.21-3.44), P = 0.008); areas of low/moderate transmission setting (AOR = 2.71 (95 % CI: 1.38-5.36), P = 0.004); and treatment with the loose formulation of artesunate-amodiaquine (AOR = 2.27 (95 % CI: 1.14-4.51), P = 0.020, compared to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine). CONCLUSIONS: The three ACTs assessed in this analysis continue to achieve rapid early parasitological clearance across the sites assessed in Sub-Saharan Africa. A threshold of 5 % day 3 parasite positivity from a minimum sample size of 50 patients provides a more sensitive benchmark in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to the current recommended threshold of 10 % to trigger further investigation of artemisinin susceptibility.","(ACT)",,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26343145/?otool=cdciclib",,,,,,,"Embase (OVID)",,,"United Kingdom",

METHODS: We used an integrated dynamic poliovirus transmission and stochastic risk model to simulate possible futures and estimate the health and economic outcomes of maintaining the 2013 status quo of continued OPV use in most developing countries compared with OPV cessation policies with various assumptions about global inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) adoption. RESULTS: Continued OPV use after global WPV eradication leads to continued high costs and/or high cases. Global OPV cessation comes with a high probability of at least one outbreak, which aggressive outbreak response can successfully control in most instances. A low but non-zero probability exists of uncontrolled outbreaks following a poliovirus reintroduction long after OPV cessation in a population in which IPV-alone cannot prevent poliovirus transmission. We estimate global incremental net benefits during 2013-2052 of approximately $16 billion (US$2013) for OPV cessation with at least one IPV routine immunization dose in all countries until 2024 compared to continued OPV use, although significant uncertainty remains associated with the frequency of exportations between populations and the implementation of long term risk management policies. CONCLUSIONS: Global OPV cessation offers the possibility of large future health and economic benefits compared to continued OPV use. Long-term poliovirus risk management interventions matter (e.g., IPV use duration, outbreak response, containment, continued surveillance, stockpile size and contents, vaccine production site requirements, potential antiviral drugs, and potential safer vaccines) and require careful consideration. Risk management activities can help to ensure a low risk of uncontrolled outbreaks and preserve or further increase the positive net benefits of OPV cessation. Important uncertainties will require more research, including characterizing immunodeficient long-term poliovirus excretor risks, containment risks, and the kinetics of outbreaks and response in an unprecedented world without widespread live poliovirus exposure.","Cited By :2: Export Date: 1 October 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: BIDMB: Correspondence Address: Duintjer Tebbens, R.J.",,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404632/?otool=cdciclib: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582932/pdf/12879_2015_Article_1112.pdf","Kid Risk, Inc., 10524 Moss Park Rd., Ste. 204-364, Orlando, FL, 32832 USA: Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA: Global Immunization Division, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1186/s12879-015-1112-8"

Dis.","14712334 (ISSN)",,,,,,,,,,,"7:47",,,,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease: Meteorological variable: Seasonality: Spectral analysis: Time series analysis","Background: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease caused by a group of enteroviruses, including Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71). In recent decades, Asian countries have experienced frequent and widespread HFMD outbreaks, with deaths predominantly among children. In several Asian countries, epidemics usually peak in the late spring/early summer, with a second small peak in late autumn/early winter. We investigated the possible underlying association between the seasonality of HFMD epidemics and meteorological variables, which could improve our ability to predict HFMD epidemics. Methods: We used a time series analysis composed of a spectral analysis based on the maximum entropy method (MEM) in the frequency domain and the nonlinear least squares method in the time domain. The time series analysis was applied to three kinds of monthly time series data collected in Wuhan, China, where high-quality surveillance data for HFMD have been collected: (i) reported cases of HFMD, (ii) reported cases of EV-A71 and CVA16 detected in HFMD patients, and (iii) meteorological variables. Results: In the power spectral densities for HFMD and EV-A71, the dominant spectral lines were observed at frequency positions corresponding to 1-year and 6-month cycles. The optimum least squares fitting (LSF) curves calculated for the 1-year and 6-month cycles reproduced the bimodal cycles that were clearly observed in the HFMD and EV-A71 data. The peak months on the LSF curves for the HFMD data were consistent with those for the EV-A71 data. The risk of infection was relatively high at 10 °C ? t < 15 °C (t, temperature [°C]) and 15 °C ? t < 20 °C, and peaked at 20 °C ? t < 25 °C. Conclusion: In this study, the HFMD infections occurring in Wuhan showed two seasonal peaks, in summer (June) and winter (November or December). The results obtained with a time series analysis suggest that the bimodal seasonal peaks in HFMD epidemics are attributable to EV-A71 epidemics. Our results suggest that controlling the spread of EV-A71 infections when the temperature is approximately 20-25 °C should be considered to prevent HFMD infections in Wuhan, China. © 2015 Chen et al.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: BIDMB: Correspondence Address: Sumi, A.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945954480&partnerID=40&md5=c24cb0203f11386f0234d16290175b53: http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/s12879-015-1233-0.pdf","Department of Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control, Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, Hubei: Department of Hygiene, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S-1, W-17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-8556: Department of Information Engineering, College of Industrial Technology, Hyogo: Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 Jianghanbei Road, Wuhan, Hubei, 430000: Department of Admission, Center of Medical Education, Sapporo Medical University, Hokkaido: School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hunan University of Commerce, Changsha, Hunan",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1186/s12879-015-1233-0"

Previous reports show distinct SFVs among NWMs but were limited to small numbers of captive or wild monkeys from five (Cebus, Saimiri, Ateles, Alouatta, and Callithrix) of the 15 NWM genera. Other studies also used only PCR testing or serological assays with limited validation and may have missed infection in some species. We developed and validated new serological and PCR assays to determine the prevalence of SFV in blood specimens from a large number of captive NWMs in the US (n = 274) and in captive and wild-caught NWMs (n = 236) in Peruvian zoos, rescue centers, and illegal trade markets. Phylogenetic and co-speciation reconciliation analyses of new SFV polymerase (pol) and host mitochondrial cytochrome B sequences, were performed to infer SFV and host co-evolutionary histories. Results: 124/274 (45.2 %) of NWMs captive in the US and 59/157 (37.5 %) of captive and wild-caught NWMs in Peru were SFV WB-positive representing 11 different genera (Alouatta, Aotus, Ateles, Cacajao, Callithrix, Cebus, Lagothrix, Leontopithecus, Pithecia, Saguinus and Saimiri). Seroprevalences were lower at rescue centers (10/53, 18.9 %) compared to zoos (46/97, 47.4 %) and illegal trade markets (3/7, 8/19, 42.9 %) in Peru. Analyses showed that the trees of NWM hosts and SFVs have remarkably similar topologies at the level of species and sub-populations suggestive of co-speciation. Phylogenetic reconciliation confirmed 12 co-speciation events (p < 0.002) which was further supported by obtaining highly similar divergence dates for SFV and host genera and correlated SFV-host branch times. However, four ancient cross-genus transmission events were also inferred for Pitheciinae to Atelidae, Cacajao to ancestral Callithrix or Cebus monkeys, between Callithrix and Cebus monkeys, and Lagothrix to Alouatta. Conclusions: We demonstrate a broad distribution and stable co-speciation history of SFV in NWMs at the species level. Additional studies are necessary to further explore the epidemiology and natural history of SFV infection of NWMs and to determine the zoonotic potential for persons exposed to infected monkeys in captivity and in the wild. © 2015 Ghersi et al.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Ghersi, B.M.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945941098&partnerID=40&md5=67ca8395e5691014f4035f78a0b751b5: http://www.retrovirology.com/content/pdf/s12977-015-0214-0.pdf","U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6, Lima, Peru: Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd., MS G-45, Atlanta, GA, 30329 USA: Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3PS UK: Wildlife Conservation Society, Lima, Peru: Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Hygiene, New Orleans, LA, USA: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, 30333 USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1186/s12977-015-0214-0"

Methods: During 2008-2010, we conducted a prospective cohort study and followed ~1,800 Argentinian children aged <5years to identify those children who were hospitalized or who sought care at an emergency room with any acute respiratory infection sign or symptom (e.g., rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing, tachypnea, retractions, or cyanosis). Respiratory samples were obtained for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus testing by immunofluorescence and for rhinovirus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: The incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (24/1000 children-years), human metapneumovirus (8/1000 children-years), and influenza (8/1000 children-years) illnesses was highest among hospitalized children aged <6months and decreased among older children. In contrast, the incidence of rhinovirus was highest (12/1000 children-years) among those aged 6-23 months. In the emergency room, the incidence of rhinovirus was 459; respiratory syncytial virus 352; influenza 185; parainfluenza 177; metapneumovirus 130; and adenovirus 73/1,000 children-years. The total cost of hospitalization was a median of US$529 (Interquartile range, US$362-789).

Over the past decade, the field of utilizing malaria serological assays to measure exposure has grown rapidly, and a variety of serological methods for data acquisition and analysis of human IgG against falciparum antigens are available. Here, different immunoassays and statistical methods are utilized to analyse samples from a low transmission setting and directly compare the estimates generated. Methods: A subset of samples (n = 580) from a 2012 Haitian nationwide malaria survey was employed as sample population of low falciparum endemicity. In addition to the Haitian samples, samples from 247 US residents were used as a reference population of 'true seronegatives'. Data acquisition was performed through standard ELISA and bead-based multiplex assays assaying for IgG antibodies to the Plasmodium falciparum antigens MSP-1p19, MSP-1p42(D), MSP-1p42(F), and AMA-1. Appropriate parametric distributions and seropositivity cutoff values were determined by statistical measures. Results: Data from both assays showed a strong positive skew, and the lognormal distribution was found to be an appropriate statistical fit to the Haitian and American populations. The American samples served as a good serological true negative population for the multiplex assay, but not for ELISA-based data. Mixture model approaches to determine seronegative and seropositive populations from the Haitian data showed a high degree of distribution overlap - likely due to the historical low falciparum transmission in this nation. Different fittings to the reversible catalytic model resulted depending upon the immunoassay utilized and seropositivity cutoff method employed. Data were also analysed through fitting to penalized B-splines, presenting another possible analytical tool for the analysis of malaria serological data. Conclusions: Standardization of serological techniques and analyses may prove difficult as some tools can prove to be more useful depending on the area and parasite in question, making clear interpretation a vital pursuit. The presented analysis in the low-endemic nation of Haiti found malaria-naive US residents to be an appropriate seronegative reference population for the multiplex assay, and this assay providing consistent estimates between MSP-1 and AMA-1 antigens of percent seropositives for this low-endemic population. © 2015 Rogier et al.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Correspondence Address: Rogier, E.; Malaria Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Center for Global HealthUnited States: References: White, N.J., Pukrittayakamee, S., Hien, T.T., Faiz, M.A., Mokuolu, O.A., Dondorp, A.M., Malaria (2014) Lancet, 383, pp. 723-735. , 23953767; Kwiatkowski, D.P., How malaria has affected the human genome and what human genetics can teach us about malaria (2005) Am J Hum Genet, 77, pp. 171-192. , 1224522 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXms12jurw%3D 16001361; Proietti, C., Pettinato, D.D., Kanoi, B.N., Ntege, E., Crisanti, A., Riley, E.M., Continuing intense malaria transmission in northern Uganda (2011) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 84, pp. 830-837. , 3083756 21540398; Stewart, L., Gosling, R., Griffin, J., Gesase, S., Campo, J., Hashim, R., Rapid assessment of malaria transmission using age-specific sero-conversion rates (2009) PLoS One, 4, p. e6083. , 2698122 19562032; Wong, J., Hamel, M.J., Drakeley, C.J., Kariuki, S., Shi, Y.P., Lal, A.A., Serological markers for monitoring historical changes in malaria transmission intensity in a highly endemic region of Western Kenya, 1994-2009 (2014) Malar J, 13, p. 451. , 4258276 25416454; Drakeley, C.J., Corran, P.H., Coleman, P.G., Tongren, J.E., McDonald, S.L., Carneiro, I., Estimating medium- and long-term trends in malaria transmission by using serological markers of malaria exposure (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 5108-5113. , 555970 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXjsFemtL8%3D 15792998; Hviid, L., Barfod, L., Fowkes, F.J., Trying to remember: Immunological B cell memory to malaria (2015) Trends Parasitol, 31, pp. 89-94. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhtVGjurg%3D 25596801; Ondigo, B.N., Hodges, J.S., Ireland, K.F., Magak, N.G., Lanar, D.E., Dutta, S., Estimation of recent and long-term malaria transmission in a population by antibody testing to multiple Plasmodium falciparum antigens (2014) J Infect Dis, 210, pp. 1123-1132. , 4168304 24737801; Corran, P., Coleman, P., Riley, E., Drakeley, C., Serology: A robust indicator of malaria transmission intensity?

The Brazilian government conducted a nationwide population screening program for type 2 diabetes mellitus (BNDSP) in which 22 million capillary glucose tests were performed in individuals aged 40 years and older. The objective of this study was to evaluate the life-time cost-effectiveness of a national population-based screening program for DM2 conducted in Brazil. Methods: We used a Markov-based cost-effectiveness model to simulate the long-term costs and benefits of screening for DM2, compared to no screening program. The analysis was conducted from a public health care system perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of results to key model parameters. Results: Brazilian National diabetes screening program will yield a large health benefit and higher costs. Compared with no screening, screen detection of undiagnosed diabetes resulted in US$ 31,147 per QALY gained. Results from sensitivity analyses found that screening targeted at hypertensive individuals would cost US$ 22,695/QALY. When benefits from early glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes were considered, the cost per QALY gained would reduce significantly. Conclusions: In the base case analysis, not considering the intangible benefit of transferring diabetes management to primary care nor the benefit of using statin to treat eligible diabetic patients, CE ratios were not cost-effective considering thresholds proposed by the World Health Organization. However, significant uncertainty was demonstrated in sensitivity analysis. Our results indicate that policy-makers should carefully balance the benefit and cost of the program while considering using a population-based approach to screen for diabetes. © 2015 Toscano et al.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Toscano, C.M.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945901262&partnerID=40&md5=1e89317adac3236b6bd01e8161811fbe: http://www.dmsjournal.com/content/pdf/s13098-015-0090-8.pdf","Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA: Federal University of Goiás (UFG), Rua T-62, 595, Apto. 201, Goiânia, GO, 74223-180 Brazil: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA: UNICEF, New York City, New York, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1186/s13098-015-0090-8"

The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of common cancers in Chinese patients with T2DM. Methods: A population-based retrospective cohort study including 36,379 T2DM patients was conducted in Minhang District of Shanghai, China, during 2004 to 2010. All T2DM patients were enrolled from the standardized management system based on local electronic information system. Newly-diagnosed cancer cases were identified by record-linkage with the Shanghai Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate the risk of cancers among T2DM patients. Results: Overall crude incidence rate (CIR) of cancers was 955.21 per 105 person-years in men and 829.57 per 105 person-years in women. Increased risk of cancer was found in both gender, with an SIR being 1.28 (95 % CI = 1.17-1.38) in men and 1.44 (95 % CI =1.32-1.55) in women. Increased risk of colon (SIR = 1.97; 95 % CI = 1.49 to 2.46), rectum (1.72; 1.23 to 2.21), prostate (2.87; 2.19 to 3.56), and bladder cancers (1.98, 1.28 to 2.68) were observed in men and elevated risk of colon (1.67; 1.25 to 2.08), breast (1.66; 1.38 to 1.95), and corpus uteri cancers (2.87; 2.03 to 3.71) were observed in women.

Because of lingering uncertainty about these associations, we examined the cross-sectional associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and PTH with metabolic syndrome in a representative sample of adults in the US. METHODS: We used data from 1705 participants in the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Vitamin D was measured by radioimmunoassay, whereas PTH was measured using an electrochemiluminescent process. RESULTS: The mean concentration of vitamin D for participants with and without metabolic syndrome was 20.3 and 22.9 ng/mL, respectively (P=0.001). The mean concentration of PTH for participants with and without metabolic syndrome was 44.5 and 41.0 pg/mL, respectively (P=0.002). The age-adjusted mean concentrations of vitamin D (P for linear trend <0.001) decreased linearly, whereas PTH (P for linear trend=0.002) increased linearly, as the number of components of metabolic syndrome increased. After adjusting for age, gender, physical activity, urinary albumin creatinine ratio, and concentrations of C-reactive protein and calcium, concentrations in the highest quintile of vitamin D [prevalence ratio (PR)=0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44-0.79], but not PTH (PR=1.18; 95% CI 0.97-1.43), was significantly associated with prevalent metabolic syndrome.

Half of sexually active respondents reported consistent condom use in the past year; 2.5 percent reported dual-method use. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that urban residence, less than a ten-year age difference between partners, discussing HIV and contraception with one's partner, not intending to have a child in the next year, having no children, being in a relationship where one or both partners have additional concurrent partners, and supportive condom norms were associated with dual protection - that is, with consistent condom or dual-method use.

Using concomitant binge drinking and use of BZD as a proxy of overdose risk, we aimed to study whether buprenorphine switchers were at higher risk of overdose during methadone treatment. Design and Methods: The French National Agency for Research for Aids and Viral Hepatitis -Methaville multisite randomised trial enrolled 195 patients to assess the feasibility of initiating methadone in primary care by comparing it with methadone initiation in specialised centres. We selected 174 patients with available data on BZD use and alcohol binge drinking at baseline and 12 months, accounting for 318 visits. The outcome was defined to take into account an overdose risk gradient as follows: no BZD use, BZD use without and with binge drinking during the previous month. To identify factors associated with the outcome, we performed a mixed multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: At baseline, 26% of the sample reported BZD use alone while 16% reported BZD use and binge drinking. Half of the sample (51%) was switching from buprenorphine treatment. After multivariate analysis, employment, depressive symptoms and switching treatment from buprenorphine to methadone [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 5.38 (1.74-16.62)] remained associated with BZD use and binge drinking. Discussion and Conclusions: As well as the importance of identifying socially vulnerable and depressed methadone-maintained patients, clinicians should be aware that patients who fail buprenorphine treatment and switch to methadone require greater clinical monitoring and management to avoid the risk of overdose.

A dichotomous health care utilization variable was constructed from self-reported use of health care services in the United States. A categorical measure of provider type was constructed for those reporting use of health care. RESULTS: Over 50% of farmworkers reported at least 1 health care visit in the United States during the past 2 years; most visits occurred in a private practice. The odds of reporting health care utilization in the United States were 45% higher among farmworkers with elevated depressive symptoms. Type of provider was not associated with depressive symptoms. Women were more likely to seek health care; education and family relationships were associated with health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Latino farmworkers who live and work in rural areas seek care from private practices or migrant/Community Health Clinics. Farmworkers with elevated depressive symptoms are more likely to access health care. Rural health care providers need to be prepared to recognize, screen, and treat mental health problems among Latino farmworkers. Outreach focused on protecting farmworker mental health may be useful in reducing health care utilization while improving farmworker quality of life.",,,"http://phlic.cdc.gov/docs/ScienceClips/PDFs/v5iss16_Authors_Georges.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,"10.1111/jrh.12008"

The purpose of the study was to examine how respondents understand the questions and assess the nature of inaccurate responses. Another goal was to determine whether men who have sex with men (MSM) interpreted questions differently from non-MSM and whether questions were interpreted differently in various regions of the country. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cognitive interviewing was used for the study. This is a qualitative method that investigates how survey questions perform. It consists of semistructured interviews that explore whether respondents understand questions as intended and whether they can provide accurate answers. A total of 166 interviews were conducted. RESULTS: Respondents had an overwhelmingly similar understanding of the purpose of the questionnaire as assessing the safety of their blood for donation. This understanding framed respondents' interpretations such that each question was understood as asking the same thing; that is, ""Is my blood safe to donate?"" This interpretation did not vary among MSM versus non-MSM or by region. CONCLUSION: Respondents understood the questionnaire as assessing the safety of their blood. This interpretation served as the backdrop for the question-response process for each individual question. Specifically, rationale for answers was framed as much or more by the questionnaire's general purpose as by the specific topic of individual questions. This pattern of interpretation was the key factor responsible for both false-positive and false-negative response errors and did not vary by demographic, including in MSM.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: TRANA: Correspondence Address: Kuehnert, M.J.email: mkuehnert@cdc.gov",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84963823284&partnerID=40&md5=e0528fc6b3e26953ea155009f8970adb","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health StatisticsHyattsville, Maryland: Department of Health and Human ServicesOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease PolicyWashington, DC: Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Office of Blood, Organ, and Other Tissue SafetyCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious DiseasesAtlanta, Georgia",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1111/trf.13587"

Additional considerations for direct transport to a Level I or II trauma center (TC) were added in 2011, reflecting perceived undertriage to TCs for older adults. We examined whether age-based disparities in TC care for severe head injury decreased following introduction of the 2011 revisions. Methods: A pre-post design analyzing the 2009 and 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Emergency Department Databases and State Inpatient Databases with multivariable logistic regressions considered changes in 1) the trauma designation of the emergency department where treatment was initiated and 2) transfer to a TC following initial treatment at a non-TC. Results: Compared with adults aged 18 to 44 years, after multivariable adjustment, in both years TC care was less likely for adults aged 45 to 64 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76 in 2009 and 0.74 in 2012), aged 65 to 84 years (OR = 0.61 and 0.59), and aged 85+ years (OR = 0.53 and 0.56). Between 2009 and 2012, the likelihood of TC care increased for all age groups, with the largest increase among those aged 85+ years (OR = 1.18), which was statistically different (p = 0.02) from the increase among adults aged 18 to 44 years (OR = 1.12).

There are no clinical presentations unique to LD and hence accurate laboratory tests are required for early diagnosis. Therefore, we designed a real-time PCR assay that targets the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic spacer region (23S-5S PCR) and allows for detection of all Legionella species and discrimination of L. pneumophila from other Legionella species. In total, 271 isolates representing 50 Legionella species were tested and the assay was validated using 39 culture-positive and 110 culture-negative patient specimens collected between 1989 and 2006. PCR-positive results were obtained with all 39 culture-positive samples (100% sensitivity). Specimens that tested positive according to 23S-5S PCR, but were culture-negative, were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the amplicon or the macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene. In addition to L. pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella cincinnatiensis and Legionella micdadei were identified in the specimens. The assay showed a 7-log dynamic range displaying a sensitivity of 7.5 CFU/mL or three genome equivalents per reaction. Sixty-one specimens containing viruses or bacteria other than Legionellae were negative according to 23S-5S PCR, demonstrating its specificity.

METHODS: We used data for 23 855 men and women from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam Study. During an average of 7.8 years of follow-up, 927 participants developed diabetes. Incident diabetes was identified on the basis of self-report and was verified by contacting the patient's attending physician. The amount of time spent watching television was self-reported. RESULTS: The mean time that the participants who developed diabetes watched television was 2.4 h/week, compared with 2.0 h/week for those who did not develop diabetes (P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, educational status, smoking status, alcohol use, occupational activity, physical activity, the intake of various foods, and systolic blood pressure, the adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes among participants who watched ?4 h/day of television compared with those who watched <1 h/day was 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.27].

Risk-taking attitude is fundamental to research on the prevention of risky health behaviors, which can be an indicator of the likelihood of experiencing illness or injury during travel. The aim of this study is to investigate whether risk-taking attitudes of youths are associated with travel characteristics and likelihood of experiencing illness or injury while traveling to nonindustrialized countries. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2008 YouthStyles survey, an annual mail survey gathering demographics and health knowledge, attitudes, and practices of individuals from 9 through 18 years of age. Travelers were defined as respondents who reported traveling in the last 12 months to a destination other than the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. Risk-taking attitude was measured by using a four-item Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale. All p values ?0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Of 1,704 respondents, 131 (7.7%) traveled in the last 12 months. Females and those with higher household income were more likely to travel (odds ratio=1.6,1.1). Of those who traveled, 16.7% reported seeking pretravel medical care, with most visiting a family doctor for that care (84.0%). However, one-fifth of respondents reported illness and injury during travel; of these, 83.3% traveled with their parents. Males and older youths had higher mean sensation-seeking scores. Further, travelers had a higher mean sensation-seeking score than nontravelers. Those who did not seek pretravel medical care also had higher mean sensation-seeking scores (p=0.1, not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show an association between risk-taking attitudes and youth travel behavior. However, adult supervision during travel and parental directives prior to travel should be taken into consideration. Communication messages should emphasize the importance of pretravel advice, target parents of children who are traveling, and be communicated through family doctors.","Author Affiliation: Travelers' Health Branch, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd., MS-E03, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.: Author Email: phan@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v2iss38_Authors_Han.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Oxford","10.1111/j.1708-8305.2010.00444.x"

Conceptualizing bullying as an adverse childhood experience, 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data were used to examine the relationship between in-person and electronic bullying victimization among US high school students and health risk behaviors and conditions related to violence, substance use, sexual risk, overweight and physical activity, sleep, and asthma. METHODS: Data were from the 2011 national YRBS among students who answered questions about in-person and electronic bullying (N=13,846). The YRBS is a biennial, nationally representative survey of students in grades 9-12 (overall response rate=71%). Logistic regression analyses, stratified by sex and controlling for race/ethnicity and grade, examined the association between bullying victimization and health risk behaviors or conditions. RESULTS: Rates of victimization varied; 9.4% of students reported being bullied in-person and electronically, 10.8% only bullied in-person, 6.8% only electronically bullied, and 73.0% uninvolved. Bullying was associated with nearly all health risk behaviors and conditions studied.

Using brain-dead rabbit model and hypoxia model, levels of ALDH2 and apoptosis in tissues and cell lines were determined by Western blot, flow cytometry (FCM), and transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-16-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. After the expression of ALDH2 during hypoxia had been inhibited or activated, the accumulations of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and molecules involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were analyzed using ELISA kit and Western blot. The low expression of phosphorylated ALDH2 in liver was time-dependent in the brain-dead rabbit model. Immunohistochemistry showed ALDH2 was primarily located in endothelial, and the rates of cell apoptosis in the donation after brain-death (DBD) rabbit groups significantly increased with time. Following the treatment of inhibitor of ALDH2, daidzein, in combination with hypoxia for 8 h, the apoptosis rate and the levels of 4-HNE, P-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in contrast to that in hypoxic HUVECs; however, they all decreased after treatment with Alda-1 and hypoxia compared with that in hypoxic HUVECs (P < 0.05). Instead, the levels of P-P38, P-ERK, P-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3 decreased and the ratio of bcl-2/bax increased with ad-ALDH2 (106pfu/ml) in combination with hypoxia for 8 h, which significantly alleviated in contrast to that in hypoxic HUVECs. We found low expression of ALDH2 and high rates of apoptosis in the livers of brain-dead donor rabbits.

Aim: To compare HCC risk between Alaska Native (AN) patients with and without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance. Methods: We selected persons with (case-patients) and without (control-patients) HBsAg seroclearance from a cohort of 1346 chronically HBV-infected AN patients followed during 1982-2013. We attempted to match two control-patients/case-patient on sex, HBV genotype, and age. Person-years of follow-up for case-patients began on the date of HBsAg resolution and for control-patients began on the date equivalent to the cohort entry date plus the years of HBsAg duration for their corresponding case-patient. We compared HCC risk using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The 238 case-patients (4 with HCC) and 435 control-patients (9 with HCC) were similar in age [P-value (P) = 0.30], sex (P = 0.53) and HBV genotype (P = 0.99). Case-patients had longer person-years of follow-up than control-patients (11.7 vs. 10.1 years; P = 0.04). The HCC rate/100 000 persons was similar between case- (132) and control-patients (178; P = 0.65). The adjusted hazard ratio comparing case- and control-patients was similar for HCC [0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2-2.4], increased for each 1-year increment for age (1.1; CI: 1.0-1.1; P < 0.01), and was greater if the initial HBeAg was positive (3.5; CI: 1.1-11.0; P = 0.03). Conclusions: Hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance was not associated with reduced HCC risk; the HCC risk estimates are limited by wide 95% confidence intervals. Persons meeting HCC surveillance indications prior to HBsAg seroclearance could benefit from continued surveillance after seroclearance. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: APTHE: Correspondence Address: Gounder, P.P.email: pgounder@cdc.gov",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84963811460&partnerID=40&md5=478f689b30a4a7c9e1da8501e7c2fbad","Arctic Investigations Program Division of Preparedness and Emerging Infections National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Disease Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Anchorage, AK USA: Liver Disease and Hepatitis Program Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium Anchorage, AK USA: Division of Viral Hepatitis National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention CDC Atlanta, GA USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1111/apt.13621"

Methods and Results: Two hundred and five Salmonella isolates from diarrhoea patients were serotyped by xMAP SSA in parallel with the traditional serotyping. Forty serotypes were identified among 205 isolates; the most prevalent serotypes identified were Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Stanley, Salmonella I 4,5,12:i:-, and Salmonella Typhimurium. One hundred and ninety-five (95·1%, 195/205) isolates were serotyped completely by xMAP SSA, while 10 stereotypes were partially detected as they were not included in the assay. The xMAP SSA correctly identified 192 (98·5%, 192/195) isolates. Five nonmotile and three monophasic strains, which possessed flagellar antigen genes that weren't expressed, were completely serotyped by xMAP SSA; however, these isolates were left undetected by the traditional method. Conclusion: The xMAP SSA used in the study is a microsphere-based, molecular assay that could rapidly and accurately serotype Salmonella. It is suitable to identify the serovars of Salmonella in southern China.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to directly compare the generation of aerosol particles containing viable influenza virus during coughs and exhalations. Methods: Sixty-one adult volunteer outpatients with influenza-like symptoms were asked to cough and exhale three times into a spirometer. Aerosol particles produced during coughing and exhalation were collected into liquid media using aerosol samplers. The samples were tested for the presence of viable influenza virus using a viral replication assay (VRA). Results: Fifty-three test subjects tested positive for influenza A virus. Of these, 28 (53%) produced aerosol particles containing viable influenza A virus during coughing, and 22 (42%) produced aerosols with viable virus during exhalation. Thirteen subjects had both cough aerosol and exhalation aerosol samples that contained viable virus, 15 had positive cough aerosol samples but negative exhalation samples, and 9 had positive exhalation samples but negative cough samples. Conclusions: Viable influenza A virus was detected more often in cough aerosol particles than in exhalation aerosol particles, but the difference was not large. Because individuals breathe much more often than they cough, these results suggest that breathing may generate more airborne infectious material than coughing over time. However, both respiratory activities could be important in airborne influenza transmission. Our results are also consistent with the theory that much of the aerosol containing viable influenza originates deep in the lungs. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Lindsley, W.G.email: wlindsley@cdc.gov",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84963502539&partnerID=40&md5=35977d5d92d85494dfb9d5a135e074ee","Health Effects Laboratory Division National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morgantown, WV USA: Department of Emergency Medicine West Virginia University Morgantown, WV USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1111/irv.12390"

Methods: The United States Period Linked Birth/Infant Death data for 2010-2013 were utilised to determine risk factors associated with NEC infant death. Infant mortality rates (IMRs) were calculated and a retrospective matched case-control analysis was performed. An infant case was defined as having the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code for NEC listed on the death record. Controls were matched on birthweight and randomly selected. Conditional multivariable logistic regression models stratified by birthweight were conducted to determine risk factors for NEC infant death. Results: The average annual NEC IMR was 12.5 deaths per 100 000 live births and was higher among very low birthweight (VLBW) compared to normal birthweight infants and among black compared to white infants. For VLBW infants, the multivariable analysis identified male sex, five-minute Apgar score of less than 7, and white infants born to a mother who is less than or equal to 19 years of age to be related with NEC-associated infant death.

It is important to evaluate respirator comfort and fit for all workers of diverse anthropometry as contact pressure plays a vital role. This paper presents the procedure and results of studying contact pressure of N95 filtering face-piece respirators (FFR) by using a finite element method. Finite element models of respirators and headforms have been improved based on a previous study. The headform model contains a skin layer, muscle layer, and bone layer. The whole facial area is divided into four parts (two areas for cheeks, one area for upper forehead, and one area for chin). Two N95 FFR models (one is one-size-fits-all and the other FFR has two sizes, i.e., small and medium/large) are used to simulate the interaction between the respirator and the headform. The results show that the respirator with two sizes provides better contact pressure distribution than the one-size-fits-all respirator. It has also been shown that the one-size-fits-all respirator works well for the large, medium, and short/wide headforms, but there are indications of potential leakages for the small and long/narrow headforms. For the respirator with two sizes, the medium/large size respirator works well for the large and long/narrow headforms, while the small size respirator works well for the medium, small, and short/wide headforms. The medium/large size respirator has potential leakages for the medium headform. Furthermore, the N95 FFR with two sizes has a more uniform pressure distribution than the one-size-fits-all respirator. Future studies are needed to validate these observations with human subjects. 2010 CAD Solutions, LLC.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.: 20104013276974: Airborne particle: Contact pressure distribution: Contact pressures: Facial area: FEM: Finite element models: Human subjects: Muscle layers: N95 filtering face piece respirator: Skin layer: Small size",,,"Texas Tech University, United States",,,,,,,,,"P.

The Disaster Surveillance Workgroup (DSWG) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a standardized, single-page, morbidity surveillance form, called the Natural Disaster Morbidity Surveillance Individual Form (Morbidity Surveillance Form), to describe the distribution of injuries and illnesses, detect outbreaks, and guide timely interventions during a disaster. PROBLEM: Traditional data sources can be used during a disaster; however, supplemental active surveillance may be required because traditional systems often are disrupted, and many persons will seek care outside of typical acute care settings. Generally, these alternative settings lack health surveillance and reporting protocols. The need for standardized data collection was demonstrated during Hurricane Katrina, as the multiple surveillance instruments that were developed and deployed led to varied and uncoordinated data collection methods, analyses, and morbidity data reporting. Active, post-event surveillance of affected populations is critical for rapid responses to minimize and prevent morbidity and mortality, allocate resources, and target public health messaging. METHODS: The CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) conducted a study to evaluate a Morbidity Surveillance Form to determine its ability to capture clinical presentations. The form was completed for each patient evaluated in an emergency department (ED) during triage from 01 August, 2007 through 07 August, 2007. Data from the form were compared with the ED discharge diagnoses from electronic medical records, and kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement. RESULTS: Nine hundred forty-nine patients were evaluated, 41% were male and 57% were Caucasian. According to the forms, the most common reasons for seeking treatment were acute illness, other (29%); pain (12%); and gastrointestinal illness (8%). The frequency of agreement between discharge diagnoses and the form ranged from 3 to 100%. Kappa values ranged from 0.23-1.0, with nine of the 12 categories having very good or good agreement. CONCLUSION: With modifications to increase sensitivity for capturing certain clinical presentations, the Morbidity Surveillance Form can be a useful tool for capturing data needed to guide public health interventions during a disaster. A validated collection instrument for a post-disaster event facilitates rapid and standardized comparison and aggregation of data across multiple jurisdictions, thus, improving the coordination, timeliness, and accuracy of public health responses. The DSWG revised the Morbidity Surveillance Form based on information from this study.","Author Affiliation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, Health Studies Branch, 4770 Buford Highway, MS-F57 Atlanta, GA 30341, USA.: Author Email: GHU5@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v3iss25_Authors_Schnall.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Cambridge",

Methods: Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) routine prospective injury surveillance collects information on all fatal injuries recorded by coroners from physical examinations, police reports, and family members in eight governorates of Iraq: Baghdad, Al-Anbar, Basrah, Erbil, Kerbala, Maysan, Ninevah, and Al-Sulaimaniya. This study analyzed explosive-related fatal injuries that occurred from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013. Results: Analysis included 2,803 fatal injuries. The number of fatal injuries declined from 2010 through 2012, followed by an increase in 2013. One-thousand one-hundred and one explosion-related fatalities were documented in 2013, more than twice as many as in 2012 or in 2011. Most fatalities were among men aged 20-39 years. Of all causalities, 194 (6.9%) were among females and 302 (10.8%) were among children aged less than 18 years. The majority of fatalities were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs): car bombs (15.3%), suicide bombs (4.0%), and other IEDs (29.6%). The highest number of fatalities occurred in streets and roads. Of all deaths, 95.6% occurred in three governorates: Baghdad, Ninevah, and Al-Anbar. Conclusions: Explosives continue to result in a high number of fatal injuries in Iraq. Following a period of declining violence from explosives, in 2013, fatalities increased.

They are key components of the structure and dynamics of the oceans and thus sustain the benefits that humans obtain from these aquatic environments. However, some microalgal blooms can cause harm to humans and other organisms. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have direct impacts on human health and negative influences on human wellbeing, mainly through their consequences to coastal ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism and recreation) and other marine organisms and environments. HABs are natural phenomena, but these events can be favoured by anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas. Global warming and associated changes in the oceans could affect HAB occurrences and toxicity as well, although forecasting the possible trends is still speculative and requires intensive multidisciplinary research. At the beginning of the 21st century, with expanding human populations, particularly in coastal and developing countries, mitigating HABs impacts on human health and wellbeing is becoming a more pressing public health need. The available tools to address this global challenge include maintaining intensive, multidisciplinary and collaborative scientific research, and strengthening the coordination with stakeholders, policymakers and the general public. Here we provide an overview of different aspects of the HABs phenomena, an important element of the intrinsic links between oceans and human health and wellbeing.","Export Date: 8 December 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: JMBAA: Correspondence Address: Berdalet, E.email: berdalet@icm.csic.es",,"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10040512&fileId=S0025315415001733","Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC), Passeig Marítim de la Barceloneta, 37-49, 08003 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain: European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School, Truro, Cornwall TR1 3HD, UK: Fisheries and Aquatic Ecosystems Branch, Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Newforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX, UK: Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS), Scottish Marine Institute, Oban, PA37 1QA, UK: Ifremer, Laboratoire Phycotoxines, BP21105, Rue de l'Ile d'Yeu, 44311 Nantes Cedex 03, France: National Center for Environmental Health, 4770 Buford Highway NE, MS F-60, Chamblee, GA 30341: University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Joint Office for Science Support.

Those found to be at significant risk for radiation injury can be prioritized to receive potentially lifesaving myeloid cytokines and to be evacuated to other communities with intact health care infrastructure prior to the onset of severe complications of bone marrow suppression. Currently, the most efficient and accessible triage method is the use of sequential complete blood counts to assess lymphocyte depletion kinetics that correlate with estimated whole-body dose radiation exposure. However, even this simple test will likely not be available initially on the scale required to assess the at-risk population. Additional variables such as geographic location of exposure, sheltering, and signs and symptoms may be useful for initial sorting. An interdisciplinary working group composed of federal, state, and local public health experts proposes an Exposure And Symptom Triage (EAST) tool combining estimates of exposure from maps with clinical assessments and single lymphocyte counts if available. The proposed tool may help sort survivors efficiently at assembly centers near the damage and fallout zones and enable rapid prioritization for appropriate treatment and transport.","Export Date: 14 August 2017:Article in Press:Correspondence Address: Hick, J.L.email: John.hick@hcmed.org",,"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/proposed-exposure-and-symptom-triage-east-tool-to-assess-radiation-exposure-after-a-nuclear-detonation/B29355A213FD03AB458D1EE1784EFAF6","Hennepin County Medical Center and Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota:REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management) website and US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Washington, DC:CBRNE Science and Operations, US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Office of Emergency Management, Washington, DC:Radiation Studies Branch, Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia:Hospital Preparedness Program, US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Office of Emergency Management",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1017/dmp.2017.86"

OBJECTIVE: This report provides smoothed estimates of major percentiles of percentage body fat for boys and girls aged 8-19 years in the United States. METHODS: Percentage body fat was obtained from whole-body, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans conducted during the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A nonparametric double-kernel method was employed to smooth percentile curves for the DXA data. RESULTS: The pattern of body fat development differs between boys and girls aged 8-19 years. In most age groups, girls have a higher percentage of body fat than boys. Among boys, there is a drop in body fat percentage in early adolescence that is especially pronounced at the higher percentiles. Among girls this pattern is not seen; percentage body fat increases slightly with age. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a smoothed reference distribution of percentage body fat for U.S. children and adolescents aged 8-19 years.","Author Affiliation: Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA.",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v3iss50_Authors_Ogden.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Atlanta",

The primary strategy for mitigating the detrimental effects of insecticide resistance is the development of an insecticide resistance management plan. However, few examples exist to show how to implement such plans programmatically.

We investigated 78 persons who had laboratory-confirmed MERS during March 2–May 10 and documented contact at this hospital. The 78 persons with MERS comprised 53 patients, 16 healthcare workers, and 9 visitors. Among the 53 patients, the most probable sites of acquisition were the emergency department (22 patients), inpatient areas (17), dialysis unit (11), and outpatient areas (3). Infection control deficiencies included limited separation of suspected MERS patients, patient crowding, and inconsistent use of infection control precautions; aggressive improvements in these deficiencies preceded a decline in cases. MERS coronavirus transmission probably was multifocal, occurring in multiple hospital settings. Continued vigilance and strict application of infection control precautions are necessary to prevent future MERS outbreaks. © 2016, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Although most persons with Zika virus show no symptoms, the virus can cause neurologic and other complications, including fetal microcephaly. Local Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico has been reported since December 2015. To prevent transfusion-associated transmission, local blood collection ceased in March 2016 but resumed in April 2016 after Zika virus screening of blood donations became available. Using data from screening of blood donations collected by the 2 largest blood centers in Puerto Rico during April 3-August 12, 2016, and assuming a 9.9-day duration of viremia, we estimated that 469,321 persons in Puerto Rico were infected during this period, for an estimated cumulative incidence of 12.9%.

As with adults, it poses a serious health threat to youth and young adults in the United States and has significant implications for this nation's public and economic health in the future. The impact of cigarette smoking and other tobacco use on chronic disease, which accounts for 75% of American spending on health care, is well-documented and undeniable. Although progress has been made since the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health in 1964, nearly one in four high school seniors is a current smoker. Most young smokers become adult smokers. One-half of adult smokers die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. Despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Yet a robust science base exists on social, biological, and environmental factors that influence young people to use tobacco, the physiology of progression from experimentation to addiction, other health effects of tobacco use, the epidemiology of youth and young adult tobacco use, and evidence-based interventions that have proven effective at reducing both initiation and prevalence of tobacco use among young people. Those are precisely the issues examined in this report, which aims to support the application of this robust science base.","Book: NBK99237 [bookaccession]",,"http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2012/index.htm",,,,,,,,,"eng","Atlanta (GA)",

The present study examined behavioral reinforcement profiles of school refusal behavior: negative reinforcement (avoidance) and positive reinforcement (gaining parental attention or receiving tangible benefits from not attending school). School social workers obtained information on school refusal behavior for 99 upper-elementary and middle school students referred for attendance problems. Three profiles were identified: 17.2 percent missed school to avoid fear- or anxiety-producing situations, escape from adverse social or evaluative situations, or gain positive tangible rewards (multiple profile); 60.6 percent missed school to gain parental attention or receive tangible rewards (positive reinforcement); and 22.2 percent had no profile. All three groups significantly differed in mean scores for behavioral difficulties, with children in the multiple profile group having the highest level of behavioral problems and children in the no profile group having the lowest. Children in the multiple profile group had higher mean scores on frequency of victimization and total number of traumatic or stressful events than did those in the other groups. Although more studies are needed, these findings suggest that school refusal behavior assessments may serve as a tool to better understand the phenomena of school attendance problems.

An underground limestone mine in Ohio is used as a test case for monitoring of structurally unstable pillars. Seven pillars were photographed over in a 63day period, punctuated by four visits. Using photogrammetry, point clouds of the mine geometry were obtained and triangulation surfaces were generated to determine volumes of change over time. Pillar spalling in the range of 0.29-4.03m3 of rock on individual rib faces was detected. Isolated incidents of rock expansion prior to failure, and the isolated failure of a weak shale band were also observed. Much of the pillars remained unchanged during the monitoring period, which is indicative of proper alignment in the triangulated surfaces. The photographs of some ribs were of either too poor quality or had insufficient overlap, and were not included. However, photogrammetry was successfully applied to multiple ribs in quantifying the pillar geometry change over time.","Export Date: 15 January 2016: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Slaker, B.email: slakerba@gmail.com","Not in PubMed","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095268615002049","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg 24060, USA: Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, NIOSH, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.ijmst.2015.11.023"

A better understanding of current rib support practices in U.S. coal mines is crucial for developing a sound engineering rib support design tool. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current practices of rib control in U.S. coal mines. Twenty underground coal mines were studied representing various coal basins, coal seams, geology, loading conditions, and rib control strategies. The key findings are: (1) any rib design guideline or tool should take into account external rib support as well as internal bolting; (2) rib bolts on their own cannot contain rib spall, especially in soft ribs subjected to significant load - external rib control devices such as mesh are required in such cases to contain rib sloughing; (3) the majority of the studied mines follow the overburden depth and entry height thresholds recommended by the Program Information Bulletin 11-29 issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration; (4) potential rib instability occurred when certain geological features prevailed - these include draw slate and/or bone coal near the rib/roof line, claystone partings, and soft coal bench overlain by rock strata; (5) 47% of the studied rib spall was classified as blocky - this could indicate a high potential of rib hazards; and (6) rib injury rates of the studied mines for the last three years emphasize the need for more rib control management for mines operating at overburden depths between 152.4 m and 304.8 m.","Export Date: 1 February 2016: Correspondence Address: Mohamed, K.M.; Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, Ground Control BranchUnited States; email: kmohamed@cdc.gov: References: Jones, T., Mohamed, K., Klemetti, T., Investigating the contributing factors to rib fatalities through historical analysis (2014) Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Ground Control in Mining, Morgantown, pp. 113-122; East, J.A., Coal fields of the conterminous United States: National coal resource assessment updated version (2013) U.S. Geological Survey Open-file Report 2012-1205; Holmes, P., Relations between geology and the stability of faces and roadways in the Barnsley seam (1981) Dev Geotech Eng, 32, pp. 118-122; Colwell, M.G., Mark, C., Analysis and design of rib support (ADRS): A rib support design methodology for Australian Collieries (2005) Proceedings of 24th International Conference in Ground Control in Mining, pp. 12-22. , Morgantown, WV",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84954385215&partnerID=40&md5=d4840fb00d462297a115971b839dfa99","Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, Ground Control Branch, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.ijmst.2015.11.014"

A coal mine under variable topography from the Central Appalachian region is used as a case study. At this mine, unexpected roof conditions were encountered during development below previously mined panels. Stress mapping and observation of ground conditions were used to quantify the success of entry support systems in three room-and-pillar panels. Numerical model analyses were initially conducted to estimate the stresses induced by the multiple-seam mining at the locations of the affected entries. The SRM was used to quantify the stability factor of the supported roof of the entries at selected locations. The SRM-calculated stability factors were compared with observations made during the site visits, and the results demonstrate that the SRM adequately identifies the unexpected roof conditions in this complex case. It is concluded that the SRM can be used to effectively evaluate the likely success of roof supports and the stability condition of entries in coal mines.","Export Date: 12 February 2016: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Tulu, I.B.email: ITulu@cdc.gov","Not in PubMed","http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84955275609&partnerID=40&md5=0bc7e00c0837da75ae606cc7fb0889f9","Ground Control Branch NIOSH, Office of Mine Safety and Health Research Pittsburgh, PA 15216, USA: Lone Mountain Processing Inc., St. Charles, VA 24282, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.ijmst.2015.12.003"

When such trials involve minors, researchers may face challenges in obtaining parental buy-in, especially if return of results procedures uphold the confidentiality and privacy rights of minors and preclude parental access to test results. In preparation for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with junior secondary school (JSS) students in Botswana, a formative assessment was conducted to assess parents' opinions and concerns about testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (biomarker of sexual activity) as part of the RCT. Methods: Six focus groups were held with parents (n?32) of JSS students from urban, peri-urban and rural communities. Parents were asked their opinions of students being tested for HSV-2 and procedures for blood sample collection and return of results. Results: Overall, parents were supportive of HSV-2 testing, which they thought was a beneficial sexual health resource for adolescents and parents, and a motivation for parent-child communication about HSV-2, sexual activity and sexual abuse. Some parents supported the proposed plan to disclose HSV-2 test results to adolescents only, citing the importance of adolescent privacy and the possibility of HSV-2 positive adolescents being stigmatised by family members. Conversely, opposing parents requested parental access to results. These parents were concerned that adolescents may experience distress following a positive result and withhold this information thereby reducing parents' abilities to provide support. Parents were also concerned about support for victims of sexual abuse. Conclusion: Although the present study demonstrates that parents can be accepting of sexual activity biomarker testing of adolescents, more research is needed to identify best approaches for returning test results.","Export Date: 13 May 2016: Correspondence Address: Cham, H.J.;

The consequences of concurrency are bounded by the duration of the infectious period and by the relationships between concurrent partnerships and other dimensions of sexual behavior. Consequently, it is difficult to predict how concurrent partnerships or short gaps may be related to the spread of STI and HIV in a particular epidemiologic context in empirical reality. In recent years, analyses of sexual behavior data collected through nationally representative surveys revealed similar prevalences of concurrent sexual partnerships in Western populations. The association between concurrent sexual partnerships and STI/HIV risk is complicated. At the population level, recent findings suggest that the ecological association between polygyny and HIV prevalence is negative at the country level and at the sub-national level. To address the need for agreed-upon standard definitions and measures of concurrent sexual partnerships, which will facilitate comparisons across time and settings, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections convened a meeting in April 2009. The recommendations developed at this meeting include suggestions for a definition, indicators, and measures of concurrency.",,,"http://elib.cdc.gov:2151/content/a7527qgp386r0x76/",,,,,,,,,"English","Philadelphia","10.1007/s11908-010-0087-2"

Persons with a laboratory-confirmed illness were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire that assessed exposures 2 weeks before symptom onset. A convenience sample of managers and operators of chlorine-treated public aquatic facilities was surveyed regarding permanent supplemental treatment systems for Cryptosporidium. Among 437 cases identified (median age 12, range <1-75 years), 260 persons were interviewed. Public-treated recreational water was the most frequently reported exposure (177, 68%) of interviewed persons; almost 1 in 5 (43, 17%) swam when diarrhea was ongoing. After the 2016 outbreak, managers of some facilities expressed intentions to install supplementary water treatment systems, and by May 2017, at least one large facility installed an ultraviolet light system. Strategies to prevent additional illness included community messaging, education, and targeted remediation of affected facilities on the basis of interviews. Challenges to remediation during a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in a large jurisdiction with primarily outdoor pools underscore the importance of promoting healthy swimming practices that help prevent contamination from occurring.","Double Blind Peer Reviewed; Editorial Board Reviewed; Expert Peer Reviewed; Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

The Brownfields & Reuse Opportunity Working Group (BROWN) is a multipartner land reuse stakeholder network that includes member representatives from state and local health agencies, federal agencies, environmental consultants, environmental health professionals, and academia. In 2015, BROWN provided input on five Environmental Health Resources Self Learning Modules (Epidemiology, Risk Assessment, Risk Communications, Land Reuse Sites, and Toxicology) that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was developing. ATSDR created the educational modules as resources and self-study guides to increase LHD capacity to respond to environmental issues. Following input from BROWN members on the modules, the National Environmental Health Association independently developed a short survey to identify baseline capacity of environmental professionals, primarily LHD professionals, to address environmental health and land reuse issues. The survey results of 93 LHD personnel indicated variation in the level of education among LHD employees and how often specific environmental health and land reuse services were requested. A subset of three LHD respondents also provided input into the learning modules.","Double Blind Peer Reviewed; Editorial Board Reviewed; Expert Peer Reviewed; Peer Reviewed; Public Health; USA.

Data used for the analysis were collected from LHDs by the National Association of County and City Health Officials for its 2013 national profile study of LHDs. We analyzed the data during 2016. Apart from understanding basic characteristics of LHDs in the nation, we introduced new measures of these characteristics, including ""EH full-time equivalents"" per 100,000 population and ""other revenue"" (revenues from fees and fines) per capita. The association of these and other organizational characteristics with EH services were measured using likelihood ratio x2 and t-tests. Out of 34 EH services considered, LHDs directly provided an average of 12 different services. As many as 41% of the 34 EH services were not available in more than 10% of the communities served by LHDs. About 70% of communities received some services from organizations other than LHDs. All the available organizational characteristics of LHDs had association with some of the EH services. Although we might assume an increase in per capita expenditure could result in an increase in LHDs' direct involvement in providing EH services, we found it to be true only for five (15%) of the EH services. The variation of EH services provided in communities could be explained by a combination of factors such as fee generation, community needs, type of governance, and population size.","research; tables/charts.

Possible environmental sources included two active cooling towers (air-conditioning units for large buildings) <1 km from patient residences, a market misting system, a community-wide water system used for heating and cooling, and potable water. To support a timely public health response, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify Legionella DNA in environmental samples within hours of specimen collection. We detected L. pneumophila serogroup 1 DNA only at a power plant cooling tower, supporting the decision to order remediation before culture results were available. An isolate from a power plant cooling tower sample was indistinguishable from a patient isolate by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, suggesting the cooling tower was the outbreak source. PCR results were available <1 day after sample collection, and culture results were available as early as 5 days after plating. PCR is a valuable tool for identifying Legionella DNA in environmental samples in outbreak settings.","pictorial; research; tables/charts.

Multifaceted approaches involving public health, regulatory agencies, industry, and consumers are required to reduce the incidence. What is added by this report? Compared with average incidence in 2012-2014, in 2015, the incidence of Cryptosporidium and non-O157 STEC infections was higher and might, in part, be caused by the use of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs), which more than doubled during the comparison period. What are the implications for public health practice? Some information about the bacteria causing infections, such as subtype and antimicrobial susceptibility, can only be obtained if a CIDT?positive specimen is also cultured. Increasing use of CIDTs affects the interpretation of public health surveillance data and the ability to monitor progress towards prevention efforts. Currently, reflex culturing of specimens with positive CIDT reports should be considered for bacterial pathogens to obtain isolates needed for public health practice. In the long term, expedited research and development are needed to create methods to detect the genetic sequences of pathogens directly and rapidly from stool specimens, which could also benefit clinical and public health practice because subtype, resistance profile, and other features can be obtained from the genetic sequence. © 2016, Department of Health and Human Services.

Nicotine exposure during adolescence can cause addiction, might harm brain development, and could lead to sustained tobacco product use among youths. What is added by this report? In 2015, one in four high school students and one in 13 middle school students reported current use of any tobacco product (?1 day in the past 30 days). An estimated 4.7 million high school and middle school students reported current use of any tobacco product. During 2011–2015, substantial increases were observed in e-cigarette and hookah use among high school and middle school students, whereas significant decreases were observed in the use of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and bidis, resulting in no decline in tobacco use overall. During 2015, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used tobacco product among middle (5.3%) and high (16.0%) school students. What are the implications for public health practice? Use of emerging tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, is on the rise among middle and high school students; therefore, it is critical that comprehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies for youths address all tobacco products and not just cigarettes. © 2016, Department of Health and Human Services.

Mortal. Wkly. Rep.","01492195 (ISSN)",,,,,,,,,,,,"27441778",,,,"What is already known about this topic? Because of the potential for transfusion-associated transmission of Zika virus, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended deferral of blood donors in affected U.S. areas until blood donations can be screened by nucleic acid testing or blood products can be subjected to FDA-approved pathogen reduction technology (PRT). FDA has recommended that whole blood and blood components for transfusion be obtained from U.S. areas without active Zika virus transmission. What is added by this report? Puerto Rico is experiencing active Zika virus transmission and also performs local blood collections. Therefore, Puerto Rico is the first U.S. area to need to comply with FDA guidance. Historically, Puerto Rico has also imported blood from the U.S. mainland for routine purposes. Outsourcing of blood components from unaffected areas might not be feasible if there is widespread Zika virus transmission in heavily populated areas of the continental United States. Therefore, local blood collections should be maintained through the use of nucleic acid screening or PRT. What are the implications for public health practice? Importation of blood products from nonaffected areas might serve a role in prevention of transfusion-transmitted Zika virus. An approved laboratory test for blood donor screening and implementation of PRT are critical for compliance with FDA guidance and to ensure a safe and sustainable blood supply. Blood collection organizations and public health organizations need to collaborate to prepare for blood safety and adequacy challenges that might arise if Zika virus transmission spreads in the United States. © 2016, Department of Health and Human Services.

This diverse body of research is richly detailed in reports on the history of OHP. Less represented in these reports are the formative interests of the occupational health field in OHP. In the present discussion, we begin by giving greater visibility to these interests. As we show, the expressions <em>occupational health psychology</em> and <em>occupational health psychologist</em> and a vision for training and participation of psychologists in occupational health research and practice appear in the occupational health literature four decades ago. We describe how this interest inspired initiatives in OHP by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health which, in turn, influenced the formalization of OHP as a discipline in the United States. We then document sustained interests of occupational health in OHP today and illustrate the promise of this interest for psychologists, for the discipline of OHP itself, and for the health, safety, and well-being of working people. We conclude by arguing that, to realize this promise, there is value to closer and more formal engagement of psychologists and OHP institutions with the field of occupational health.",,,"http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2017-27289-001","Sauter, Steven L.: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Robert A.

However, rock fall accidents and injuries continue to occur in coal mines that have been supported according to the roof control plan. Experience at coal mines with large numbers of falls indicates that many have weak roof. Control of this roof may require additional ground control measures. An understanding of the geologic and stress conditions which lead to roof falls is necessary to assess the risk of failure and to design roof reinforcement to improve stability. Six common roof fall types, with attached field examples, are described. Roof support practices for each fall type are also described.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.: Compendex: 20103113117130: Coal miners: Coal mining: Geological hazards: Ground control: Ground failure: Risk of failure: Rockfalls: Roof fall: Stress condition",,"http://www.ejge.com/2010/Ppr10.046/Ppr10.046.pdf","Principal Research Engineer, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), P.O.

The propagation characteristics of the transmission line, which is usually the longest signal path for an MF communication system, play a major role in determining the system performance. To measure the MF propagation characteristics of transmission lines in coal mine tunnels, a method was developed based on a basic transmission line model. The method will be presented in this paper along with the propagation measurements on a transmission line system in a coal mine using the method.

Seventy-two papers or technical reports, which were published prior to July 2005, met specified quality criteria, and included evaluation outcomes relevant to public health (e.g., binge drinking, alcohol-related crash fatalities), were included in the final review. Nearly all studies, including those with different study designs, found that there was an inverse relationship between the tax or price of alcohol and indices of excessive drinking or alcohol-related health outcomes. Among studies restricted to underage populations, most found that increased taxes were also significantly associated with reduced consumption and alcohol-related harms. According to Community Guide rules of evidence, these results constitute strong evidence that raising alcohol excise taxes is an effective strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. The impact of a potential tax increase is expected to be proportional to its magnitude and to be modified by such factors as disposable income and the demand elasticity for alcohol among various population groups.",,,"http://elib.cdc.gov:2073/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VHT-4Y54MWV-F&_user=856389&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000046148&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=856389&md5=104ea973d9d3aeac443a18a3214e2bd3",,,,,,,,,,"New York","10.1016/j.amepre.2009.11.005"

PURPOSE: This article aims to assess progress toward reaching the overarching goal of eliminating disparities in vaccination coverage among young children in the U.S. METHODS: Coverage for the 4:3:1:3:3:1 vaccine series (at least four doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, three poliovirus, one measles-mumps-rubella, three hepatitis B, three Haemophilus influenzae type B, and one varicella vaccine) was assessed among 185,516 children in the 2000-2008 National Immunization Surveys. Observed and adjusted disparities in coverage were evaluated for various sociodemographic groups previously associated with vaccination coverage. Linear trends in disparities were assessed. RESULTS: In 2000, disparities among population segments were significant (p<0.05) for all sociodemographic factors assessed except provider participation in the Vaccines for Children program. By 2008, most disparities were smaller than those in 2000, and racial and urban/suburban/rural differences were reduced to levels below significance. Disparities between children living in suburban versus rural localities narrowed approximately 0.5% per year. Vaccination coverage increased substantially among children in all sociodemographic groups, although children without siblings were the only group to reach the 80% target by 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Progress has been made toward eliminating vaccination coverage disparities among children in various sociodemographic groups in the U.S. As the end of the Healthy People 2010 goal period approaches, maintaining and advancing these reductions will require innovative strategies to reach underserved groups.",,,"http://elib.cdc.gov:2073/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VHT-4Y54MWV-2&_user=856389&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000046148&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=856389&md5=6fdc5c3020453cb1519fb50e28f03d6a",,,,,,,,,,"New York","10.1016/j.amepre.2009.10.035"

However, the technique depends upon reliable correlations between the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and the sonic velocity. This paper describes research recently conducted by NIOSH aimed at developing a correlation for use by the U.S. mining industry. From two coreholes in Illinois, two from Pennsylvania, and one each from Colorado, western Kentucky and southern West Virginia, sonic velocity logs were compared with UCS values derived from Point Load tests for a broad range of coal measure rock types. For the entire data set, the relationship between UCS and sonic travel time is expressed by an exponential equation relating the UCS in psi to the travel time of the P-wave in s/ft. The coefficient of determination or R-squared for this equation is 0.72, indicating that a relatively high reliability can be achieved with this technique. The strength estimates obtained from the correlation equation may be used to help design roof support systems. The paper also addresses the steps that are necessary to ensure that high-quality sonic logs are obtained for use in estimating UCS. 2010.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.: 20103513205868: CMRR: Coal mine roof rating: Coal mining: Corehole: Geophysical logging: Geophysical strata rating (GSR): Sonic log: Uniaxial compressive strength",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v2iss38_Authors_Oyler.pdf","NIOSH-Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",,,,,,,,,"P.O.

Translational research is a process for developing evidence-based interventions and implementing them in practice. The purpose of this study was to organize the literature on occupational safety in the fishing industry within the T0-T4 phases of translational research to identify areas of strength and consensus, as well as gaps for future translational research to address. A comprehensive search of the English language literature on the topic of occupational safety in the fishing industry was completed. Scientific investigations of safety problems in the fishing industry first appeared in the literature during the 1950s. The bulk of research has focused on descriptive epidemiology in the T0 phase of translational research. A positive trend in recent studies is the growing emphasis on translational research (i.e. the T1-T4 phases). These types of studies aim to move research-to-practice by investigating potential solutions to safety problems and by developing, implementing and evaluating interventions. Recommendations for future translational research include using consistent methods of injury classification and risk analysis, developing interventions targeted at specific problems in the highest-risk fisheries, and addressing the barriers and facilitators to widespread implementation of interventions. Workplace safety in the fishing industry will improve if future research concentrates on identifying and testing promising safety measures that are effective, practical and scalable.

According to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) 2012 report 'Death on the Job', for the years 1992 through 2010 the percent of cases involving MSDs in private industry were highest in 2000 (35%) and lowest in 2007 (29%). In 2010, the median number of days away from work for MSDs was 11 compared to 8 for all occupational injury cases involving days away from work; the median number of days away from work for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) was 25, more than three times as high as for all other BLS injuries involving days away from work (BLS, 2011). This study estimated the costs of work related MSDs, and given that the number of days lost due to CTS is very high, it also estimated the costs of CTS separately in the United States (US) for the years 2003 through 2007. METHODS: The costs of work related MSDs and CTS in the US were estimated using the cost-of-illness, human capital method (Leigh etal., 2000), using some of the costs from the literature. This method decomposes costs into direct and indirect categories. Estimates of total cost of MSDs and CTS were obtained from the product of average costs of MSDs and CTS and the number of MSDs and CTS. The number of MSDs and CTS were obtained from BLS data. RESULTS: The number of reported work-related MSDs declined from 435,180 in 2003 to 335,390 in 2007 and the reported number of CTS also declined from 22,110 in 2003 to 11,920 in 2007. The direct costs of MSDs and CTS were respectively $1.5 billion and $0.1 billion for the year 2007. The indirect costs were $1.1 billion and $0.1 billion for MSDs and CTS respectively for the year 2007. DISCUSSION: This study found that the total costs of work-related MSDs and CTS declined during the period 2003 through 2007 but the average costs per case went up signifying that medical costs and other associated costs increased during this period. RELEVANCE TO INDUSTRY: The costs of MSDs are important to the industries too as a significant part of these costs are borne by the employers. Industries with higher prevalence of MSDs are affected more in terms of lost productivities due to the employees' days away from work because of MSDs. In cases of MSDs causing permanent disabilities, new hiring and training costs are also a part of the losses experienced by the employers.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20141617590895: Associated costs: Bureau of Labor Statistics: Carpal tunnel syndrome: Industrial organization: Lost productivities: Musculoskeletal disorders: Occupational injury: Private industries",,"http://phlic.cdc.gov/docs/ScienceClips/PDFs/6-18-Authors-Bhattacharya.pdf","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Education and Information Division, MS C-15, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, OH 45226, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.ergon.2014.01.008"

The aim of this paper is to infer strata separation intervals and thus gas emission pathways from standard well log data. The proposed technique was applied to well logs acquired through the Mary Lee/Blue Creek coal seam of the Upper Pottsville Formation in the Black Warrior Basin, Alabama, using well logs from a series of boreholes aligned along a nearly linear profile.For this purpose, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of digitized gamma well logs was performed by using Mexican hat and Morlet, as the mother wavelets, to identify potential discontinuities in the signal. Pointwise Holder exponents (PHE) of gamma logs were also computed using the generalized quadratic variations (GQV) method to identify the location and strength of singularities of well log signals as a complementary analysis. PHEs and wavelet coefficients were analyzed to find the locations of singularities along the logs.Using the well logs in this study, locations of predicted singularities were used as indicators in single normal equation simulation (SNESIM) to generate equi-probable realizations of potential strata separation intervals. Horizontal and vertical variograms of realizations were then analyzed and compared with those of indicator data and training image (TI) data using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A sum of squared differences was employed to select the most probable realization representing the locations of potential strata separations and methane flow paths.Results indicated that singularities located in well log signals reliably correlated with strata transitions or discontinuities within the strata. Geostatistical simulation of these discontinuities provided information about the location and extents of the continuous channels that may form during mining. If there is a gas source within their zone of influence, paths may develop and allow methane movement towards sealed or active gobs under pressure differentials. Knowledge gained from this research will better prepare mine operations for potential methane inflows, thus improving mine safety.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20141717619251: Complementary analysis: Continuous Wavelet Transform: Continuous wavelet transforms: Geostatistical simulation: Methane flow: Potential discontinuity: Strength of singularity: Sum of squared differences",,,"NIOSH, Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.03.019"

Epidemiologic investigations by health departments in those states and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified shredded iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) as the vehicle of transmission. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Minnesota and California public health agencies traced the lettuce to several growing regions in California based on information from a lettuce processor in Minnesota.Samples from an environmental investigation initiated by the California Food Emergency Response Team (CalFERT) revealed a genetic match between the outbreak strain and environmental samples from a single farm, leading to an in-depth systems-based analysis of the irrigation water system on that farm. This paper presents findings from that systems-based analysis, which assessed conditions on the farm potentially contributing to contamination of the lettuce. The farm had three sources of irrigation water: groundwater from onsite wells, surface water delivered by a water management agency and effluent from wastewater lagoons on nearby dairy farms. Wastewater effluent was blended with the other sources and used only to irrigate animal feed crops. However, water management on the farm, including control of wastewater blending, appeared to create potential for cross-contamination. Pressure gradients and lack of backflow measures in the irrigation system might have created conditions for cross-contamination of water used to irrigate lettuce. The irrigation network on the farm had evolved over time to meet various needs, without an overall analysis of how that evolution potentially created vulnerabilities to contamination of irrigation water. The type of systems analysis described here is one method for helping to ensure that such vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. A preventive, risk-based management approach, such as the Water Safety Plan process for drinking water, may also be useful in managing irrigation water quality.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20150200404262: Centers for disease control and preventions: Environmental assessment: Environmental investigation: Escherichia coli O157:H7: Food and Drug Administration: Irrigation water quality: Public-health agencies: Risk-based managements",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377414003801","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Center for Global Health, Health Systems Reconstruction Team, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F-57, Atlanta; GA, United StatesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health, Environmental Health Services Branch, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F-58, Atlanta; GA, United StatesCalifornia Department of Public Health, Food and Drug Branch, 1500 Capitol Ave, MS 7602, Sacramento; CA, United StatesFood and Drug Administration, Pacific Region, 1301 Clay St., Suite 1180N, Oakland; CA, United StatesDepartment of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Tennessee, 1412 Circle Drive, Knoxville; TN, United StatesREB Model Analytics LLC, 4744 North Royal Atlanta Drive, SuiteB-1, Tucker; GA, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.agwat.2014.12.002"

Four instrumented adapters with different weights were used to measure the vibration transmitted to the wrist, forearm, and upper arm of each subject. Each adapter was attached at each location on the subjects using an elastic cloth wrap. Two laser vibrometers were also used to measure the transmitted vibration at each location to evaluate the validity of the adapter method. The apparent mass at the palm of the hand along the forearm direction was also measured to enhance the evaluation. This study found that the adapter and laser-measured transmissibility spectra were comparable with some systematic differences. While increasing the adapter mass reduced the resonant frequency at the measurement location, increasing the tightness of the adapter attachment increased the resonant frequency. However, the use of lightweight (15 g) adapters under medium attachment tightness did not change the basic trends of the transmissibility spectrum. The resonant features observed in the transmissibility spectra were also correlated with those observed in the apparent mass spectra. Because the local coordinate systems of the adapters may be significantly misaligned relative to the global coordinates of the vibration test systems, large errors were observed for the adapter-measured transmissibility in some individual orthogonal directions. This study, however, also demonstrated that the misalignment issue can be resolved by either using the total vibration transmissibility or by measuring the misalignment angles to correct the errors. Therefore, the adapter method is acceptable for understanding the basic characteristics of the vibration transmission in the human arms, and the adapter-measured data are acceptable for approximately modeling the system.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.: 20152500960170: Adapter method: Basic characteristics: Hand arm vibrations: Hand-transmitted vibration: Local coordinate system: Vibration test system: Vibration transmissibility: Vibration transmission",,,"Engineering and Control Technology Branch, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, MS L-2027, Morgantown; WV, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.measurement.2015.05.039"

We aimed to assess if EE impairs the success of oral polio and rotavirus vaccines in infants in Bangladesh. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of 700 infants from an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh from May 2011 to November 2014. Infants were enrolled in the first week of life and followed to age one year through biweekly home visits with EPI vaccines administered and growth monitored. EE was operationally defied as enteric inflammation measured by any one of the fecal biomarkers reg1B, alpha-1-antitrypsin, MPO, calprotectin, or neopterin. Oral polio vaccine success was evaluated by immunogenicity, and rotavirus vaccine response was evaluated by immunogenicity and protection from disease. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01375647. Findings: EE was present in greater than 80% of infants by 12. weeks of age. Oral poliovirus and rotavirus vaccines failed in 20.2% and 68.5% of the infants respectively, and 28.6% were malnourished (HAZ. <. -2) at one year of age. In contrast, 0%, 9.0%, 7.9% and 3.8% of infants lacked protective levels of antibody from tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria and measles vaccines respectively. EE was negatively associated with oral polio and rotavirus response but not parenteral vaccine immunogenicity. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and measures of maternal health were additionally predictive of both oral vaccine failure and malnutrition. The selected biomarkers from multivariable analysis accounted for 46.3% variation in delta HAZ. 24% of Rotarix® IgA positive individuals can be attributed to the selected biomarkers. Interpretation: EE as well as systemic inflammation and poor maternal health were associated with oral but not parenteral vaccine underperformance and risk for future growth faltering. These results offer a potential explanation for the burden of these problems in low-income problems, allow early identification of infants at risk, and suggest pathways for intervention.

The culmination of these efforts has begun to enhance a collective understanding. Despite this enhanced theoretical understanding, however, there are still continuing debates and little consensus. The goal of the current research effort was to empirically explore common methods to HSMS performance measurement in mining organizations. The purpose was to determine if value and insight could be added into the ongoing approaches of the best ways to engage in health and safety performance measurement. Nine site-level health and safety management professionals were provided with 133 practices corresponding to 20 HSMS elements, each fitting into the plan, do, check, act phases common to most HSMS. Participants were asked to supply detailed information as to how they (1) assess the performance of each practice in their organization, or (2) would assess each practice if it were an identified strategic imperative. Qualitative content analysis indicated that the approximately 1200 responses provided could be described and categorized into interventions, organizational performance, and worker performance. A discussion of how these categories relate to existing indicator frameworks is provided. The analysis also revealed divergence in two important measurement issues; (1) quantitative vs qualitative measurement and reporting; and (2) the primary use of objective or subjective metrics. In lieu of these findings we ultimately recommend a balanced measurement and reporting approach within the three metric categories and conclude with suggestions for future research.","Export Date: 8 December 2015: CODEN: SSCIE: Correspondence Address: Haas, E.J.; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), 626 Cochrans Mill Rd, United States; email: EJHaas@cdc.gov: References: American National Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (2012) American National Standards Institute, Washington, DC., , ANSI/AIHA Z-10:2005; Berg, B.L., (2001) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , Allyn and Bacon, Boston; Bergh, L.I.V., Hinna, S., Leka, S., Jain, A., Developing a performance indicator for psychosocial risk in the oil and gas industry (2014) Safety Sci., 62, pp. 98-106; Bowen, D.E., Ostroff, C., Understanding HRM-firm performance linkages: the role of the ""strength"" of the HRM system (2004) Acad.

Vaccination programs are now being extended to include males in some countries, in order to improve population level HPV infection control and to directly prevent HPV-related disease in males such as anogenital warts and anal cancers. Coverage and adverse events surveillance are essential components of post-vaccination monitoring. Monitoring the impact of vaccination on HPV infection and disease in men raises some similar challenges to monitoring in females, such as the long time frame until cancer outcomes, and also different ones given that genital specimens suitable for monitoring HPV prevalence are not routinely collected for other diagnostic or screening purposes in males. Thus, dedicated surveillance strategies must be designed; the framework of these may be country-specific, dependent upon the male population that is offered vaccination, the health care infrastructure and existing models of disease surveillance such as STI networks. The primary objective of any male HPV surveillance program will be to document changes in the prevalence of HPV infection and disease due to vaccine targeted HPV types occurring post vaccination. The full spectrum of outcomes to be considered for inclusion in any surveillance plan includes HPV prevalence monitoring, anogenital warts, potentially pre-cancerous lesions such as anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), and cancers. Ideally, a combination of short term and long term outcome measures would be included. Surveillance over time in specific targeted populations of men who have sex with men and HIV-infected men (populations at high risk for HPV infection and associated disease) could be an efficient use of resources to demonstrate impact.","Export Date: 3 July 2016: Correspondence Address: Brotherton, J.M.L.; National HPV Vaccination Program Register, Victorian Cytology Service, PO Box 310, Australia; email: jbrother@vcs.org.au: References: Bouvard, V., Baan, R., Straif, K., Grosse, Y., Secretan, B., El Ghissassi, F., A review of human carcinogens--Part B: biological agents (2009) Lancet Oncol., 10 (4), pp. 321-322; Koutsky, L., The epidemiology behind the HPV vaccine discovery (2009) Ann.

To screen and identify a category of metabolites with distinct isotopic distribution, this study proposed a generic strategy using in silico metabolite prediction plus accurate-mass-based isotopic pattern recognition (AMBIPR) and library identification on the data acquired via the data dependent MS/MS scan of LC-Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The proposed method was evaluated by the analysis of flurochloridone (FLC) metabolites in rat urine sample collected from toxicity tests. Different from the traditional isotopic pattern recognition (IPR) approach, AMBIPR here was performed based on the potential metabolites predicted via in silico metabolite prediction tools. Thus, the AMBIPR treated FLC data was only associated with FLC metabolites, consequently not only avoiding great efforts made to remove FLC-unrelated information and reveal FLC metabolites, but also increasing the percent of positive hits. Among the FLC metabolite peaks screened using AMBIPR, 87% of them (corresponding 97 metabolites and 49 biotransformation) were successfully identified via multiple MS identification techniques packaged in an established FLC's metabolites library based on Mass Frontier. Noteworthy, 34 metabolites (89%) were identified without distinct naturally isotopic distribution. The universal strategic approach based on background subtraction (BS) and mass defect filtering (MDF) was used to evaluate the AMBIPR and no more false positive and negative metabolites were detected. Furthermore, our results revealed that AMBIPR is very effective, inherently sensitive and accurate, and is easily automated for the rapidly screening and profiling chemicals related metabolites. © 2016.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: JCRAE: Correspondence Address: Zhou, Z.email: zjzhou@fudan.edu.cn",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84962632956&partnerID=40&md5=7eace2566037c81b4d8de5b2e44d6057","School of Public Health/MOE Key Lab for Public Health/Collaborative Innovation Center of Social Risks Governance in Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China: Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1380 Zhongshan West Road, Shanghai 200336, China: Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Shanghai Institute for Food and Drug Control, Shanghai 201203, China: Environmental Health Laboratory Branch, California Department of Public Health, Richmond CA 94804, CA, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.chroma.2016.03.080"

However, there is limited information on the risks, physical demands, or the benefits of using one tool over another. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physical demands involved with two closing methods and several sealing tools in order to provide recommendations for selecting tools to reduce exposure to risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. In this study, twelve participants completed bag closing and sealing tasks using two different closing methods and eight sealing tools on two types of bulk bags. Physical demands and performance were evaluated using muscle activity, perceived exertion, subjective ratings of use, and time. Results indicate that using the ""flowering"" method to close bags required on average 32% less muscle activity, 30% less perceived exertion, 42% less time, and was preferred by participants compared to using the ""snaking"" method. For sealing, there was no single method significantly better across all measures; however, using a pneumatic cable tie gun consistently had the lowest muscle activity and perceived exertion ratings. The pneumatic cable tie gun did require approximately 33% more time to seal the bag compared to methods without a tool, but the amount of time to seal the bag was comparable to using other tools. Further, sealing a spout bulk bag required on average 13% less muscle activity, 18% less perceived exertion, 35% less time, and was preferred by participants compared to sealing a duffle bulk bag. The current results suggest that closing the spout bag using the flowering method and sealing the bag using the pneumatic cable tie gun that is installed with a tool balancer is ergonomically advantageous. Our findings can help organizations select methods and tools that pose the lowest physical demands when closing and sealing bulk bags. © 2016.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: CODEN: IJIEE: Correspondence Address: Nasarwanji, M.F.; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, United States; email: MNasarwanji@cdc.gov: References: Armstrong, T.J., Buckle, P., Fine, L.J., Hagberg, M., Jonsson, B., Kilbom, A., Viikari-Juntura, E.R., A conceptual model for work-related neck and upper-limb musculoskeletal disorders (1993) Scand.

Rapid and sensitive molecular-based bacterial strain discrimination methods are critical for timely outbreak identification and contaminated food source traceback. One such method, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), is being used with increasing frequency in foodborne illness outbreak investigations to augment the current gold standard bacterial subtyping technique, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The objective of this study was to develop a MLVA assay for intra- and inter-serogroup discrimination of six major non-O157 STEC serogroups-O26, O111, O103, O121, O45, and O145-and perform a preliminary internal validation of the method on a limited number of clinical isolates. The resultant MLVA scheme consists of ten variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci amplified in three multiplex PCR reactions. Sixty-five unique MLVA types were obtained among 84 clinical non-O157 STEC strains comprised of geographically diverse sporadic and outbreak related isolates. Compared to PFGE, the developed MLVA scheme allowed similar discrimination among serogroups O26, O111, O103, and O121 but not among O145 and O45. To more fully compare the discriminatory power of this preliminary MLVA method to PFGE and to determine its epidemiological congruence, a thorough internal and external validation needs to be performed on a carefully selected large panel of strains, including multiple isolates from single outbreaks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 29 April 2016: CODEN: JMIMD: Correspondence Address: Ma, L.M.; National Institute for Microbial Forensics and Food and Agricultural Biosecurity, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, Oklahoma State UniversityUnited States; email: li.ma@okstate.edu: References: Benson, G., Tandem repeats finder: a program to analyze DNA sequences (1999) Nucleic Acids Res., 27 (2), pp. 573-580; Besser, R.E., Griffin, P.M., Slutsker, L., Escherichia coli O157:H7 gastroenteritis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome: an emerging infectious disease (1999) Annu.

The objectives of this study are to determine whether VR gloves can attenuate the vibration transmitted to the fingers and to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms of how these gloves work. Seven adult male subjects participated in the experiment. The fixed factors evaluated include hand force (four levels), glove condition (gel-filled, air bladder, no gloves), and location of the finger vibration measurement. A 3-D laser vibrometer was used to measure the vibrations on the fingers with and without wearing a glove on a 3-D hand-arm vibration test system. This study finds that the effect of VR gloves on the finger vibration depends on not only the gloves but also their influence on the distribution of the finger contact stiffness and the grip effort. As a result, the gloves increase the vibration in the fingertip area but marginally reduce the vibration in the proximal area at some frequencies below 100. Hz. On average, the gloves reduce the vibration of the entire fingers by less than 3% at frequencies below 80. Hz but increase at frequencies from 80 to 400. Hz. At higher frequencies, the gel-filled glove is more effective at reducing the finger vibration than the air bladder-filled glove. The implications of these findings are discussed. Relevance to industry: Prolonged, intensive exposure to hand-transmitted vibration can cause hand-arm vibration syndrome. Vibration-reducing gloves have been used as an alternative approach to reduce the vibration exposure. However, their effectiveness for reducing finger-transmitted vibrations remains unclear. This study enhanced the understanding of the glove effects on finger vibration and provided useful information on the effectiveness of typical VR gloves at reducing the vibration transmitted to the fingers. The new results and knowledge can be used to help select appropriate gloves for the operations of powered hand tools, to help perform risk assessment of the vibration exposure, and to help design better VR gloves. 2013 .","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20134717014666: Anti-vibration gloves: Finger vibration: Hand-arm vibration: Hand-transmitted vibration: Vibration-reducing glove",,"http://phlic.cdc.gov/docs/ScienceClips/PDFs/v5iss43_Authors_Welcome.pdf","Engineering and Control Technology Branch, HELD, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC, MS L-2027, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States",,,,,,,,,"P.O.

To help optimize the adapter approach, the specific aims of this study are to identify and understand the major sources and mechanisms of measurement errors and uncertainties associated with using these adapters, and to explore their improvements. Five representative adapter models were selected and used in the experiment. Five human subjects served as operators in the experiment on a hand-arm vibration test system. The results of this study confirm that many of the handheld adapters can produce substantial overestimations of vibration exposure, and measurement errors can significantly vary with tool, adapter model, mounting position, mounting orientation, and subject. Major problems with this approach include unavoidable influence of the hand dynamic motion on the adapter, unstable attachment, insufficient attachment contact force, and inappropriate adapter structure. However, the results of this study also suggest that measurement errors can be substantially reduced if the design and use of an adapter can be systematically optimized toward minimizing the combined effects of the identified factors. Some potential methods for improving the design and use of the adapters are also proposed and discussed.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20133916778812: Combined effect: Dynamic motions: Hand-arm vibration: Hand-transmitted vibration: Handhelds: Potential methods: Triaxial accelerometer: Vibration exposure",,"https://docexpress.cdc.gov/illiad/illiad.dll?Action=10&Form=30&rft.issn=0263-2241&rft.volume=47&rft.month=1&rft.genre=article&rft.auinit=X+S&rft.pub=Elsevier&rft.stitle=MEAS&rft.auinitm=S&rft.eissn=1873-412X&rft.doi=10.1016%2Fj.measurement.2013.08.037&rft.place=London&rft.title=Measurement&id=10.1016%2Fj.measurement.2013.08.037&rft.aufirst=Xueyan&linktype=openurl&rft.atitle=An+examination+of+the+handheld+adapter+approach+for+measuring+hand-transmitted+vibration+exposure&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.auinit1=X&rft.date=2014&url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft.aulast=XU&rft.epage=77&rft.spage=64&rfr_id=CDC:ScienceClips(Via+SFX)","Engineering and Control Technology Branch, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, United States",,,,,,,,,"P.O.

Research shows that a preponderance of falls occur while getting on/off mobile equipment. Contributing factors to the risk of falls include the usage of ladders, exiting onto a slippery surface, and foot or hand slippage. Balance issues may also contribute to fall risks for mobile equipment operators who are exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV). For this reason, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Office of Mine Safety and Health Research conducted a study at four participating mine sites with seven haul truck operators. The purpose was to ascertain whether WBV and hand-arm vibration (HAV) exposures for quarry haul truck operators were linked to short-term decreases in performance in relation to postural stability, touch sensation threshold, and grip strength that are of crucial importance when getting on/off the trucks. WBV measures of frequency-weighted RMS accelerations (wRMS) and vibration dose value (VDV), when compared to the ISO/ANSI standards, were mostly below levels identified for the Health Guidance Caution Zone (HGCZ), although there were instances where the levels were within and above the specified Exposure Action Value. Comparably, all mean HAV levels, when compared to the ISO/ANSI standards, were below the HGCZ.

United States/epidemiology","An increase in adverse mental health symptoms occurred in the general population at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which peaked in 2020 and subsequently decreased (1-3). The pandemic exacerbated existing stress and fatigue among public health workers responding to the public health crisis.* During March-April 2021, a survey of state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) public health workers found that 52.8% of respondents experienced symptoms of at least one of the following mental health conditions: depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (4); however, more recent estimates of mental health symptoms among this population are limited. To evaluate trends in these conditions from the previous year, the prevalence of symptoms of mental health conditions and suicidal ideation, a convenience sample of STLT public health workers was surveyed during March 14-25, 2022. In total, 26,069 STLT public health workers responded to the survey. Among respondents,(†) 6,090 (27.7%) reported symptoms of depression, 6,467 (27.9%) anxiety, 6,324 (28.4%) PTSD, and 1,853 (8.1%) suicidal ideation. Although the prevalences of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among public health workers were lower (p<0.001)(§) among 2022 survey respondents compared with those of 2021 survey respondents (4), the prevalences of symptoms of suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD remained high among those who worked >60 hours per week (range = 11.3%-45.9%) and those who spent ≥76% of their work time on COVID-19 response activities (range = 9.0%-37.6%). Respondents were less likely to report mental health symptoms if they could take time off (prevalence ratio [PR] range = 0.48-0.55), or if they perceived an increase in mental health resources from their employer (PR range = 0.58-0.84). To support the mental health of public health workers, public health agencies can modify work-related factors, including making organizational changes for emergency responses and facilitating access to mental health resources and services.(¶).","1545-861x

HCV persistence is associated strongly with mitochondrial dysfunction, with liver mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic diversity linked to disease progression. Methods: We evaluated the genetic diversity of 2 mtDNA genomic regions (hypervariable segments 1 and 2) obtained from sera of 116 persons using next-generation sequencing. Results: Results were as follows: (1) the average diversity among cases with seronegative acute HCV infection was 4.2 times higher than among uninfected controls; (2) the diversity level among cases with chronic HCV infection was 96.1 times higher than among uninfected controls; and (3) the diversity was 23.1 times higher among chronic than acute cases. In 2 patients who were followed up during combined interferon and ribavirin therapy, mtDNA nucleotide diversity decreased dramatically after the completion of therapy in both patients: by 100% in patient A after 54 days and by 70.51% in patient B after 76 days. Conclusions: HCV infection strongly affects mtDNA genetic diversity. A rapid decrease in mtDNA genetic diversity observed after therapy-induced HCV clearance suggests that the effect is reversible, emphasizing dynamic genetic relationships between HCV and mitochondria. The level of mtDNA nucleotide diversity can be used to discriminate recent from past infections, which should facilitate the detection of recent transmission events and thus help identify modes of transmission.","Export Date: 9 December 2016: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Campo, D.S.email: fyv6@cdc.gov",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997787487&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcmgh.2016.05.012&partnerID=40&md5=a7298898e45590666b6b18928d2089d4","Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology and Bioinformatics, Division of Viral Hepatitis, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia: Center for Hepatitis C, Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia: Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia: Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia: Division of Infectious Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.jcmgh.2016.05.012"

A comprehensive study of longer-term training outcomes may reveal opportunities for improving capacity building activities and HIA practice. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with HIA trainees in the United States to assess their outcomes and needs. Using a training evaluation framework, we measured outcomes across a spectrum of reaction, learning, behavior and results. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012, four organizations trained over 2200 people in at least 75 in-person HIA trainings in 29 states. We interviewed 48 trainees, selected both randomly and purposefully. The mean duration between training and interview was 3.4. years. Trainees reported that their training objectives were met, especially when relevant case-studies were used. They established new collaborations at the trainings and maintained them. Training appeared to catalyze more holistic thinking and practice, including a range of HIA-related activities. Many trainees disseminated what they learned and engaged in components of HIA, even without dedicated funding. Going forward, trainees need assistance with quantitative methods, project management, community engagement, framing recommendations, and evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The research revealed opportunities for a range of HIA stakeholders to refine and coordinate training resources, apply a competency framework and leverage complimentary workforce development efforts, and sensitize and build the capacity of communities.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc.: 20145100336600: Capacity building: Community engagement: Evaluation: Health impact assessment: In-depth interviews: Quantitative method: Training evaluation: Workforce development",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925514001048","Berkeley; CA, United StatesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity, 4770 Buford Highway MS/F-77, Atlanta; GA, United StatesUniversity of California Berkeley, School of Public Health, Division of Community Health and Human Development, Berkeley; CA, United StatesUniversity of Washington, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Seattle; WA, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.eiar.2014.10.002"

Direct comparisons of body mass index (BMI, weight/height2) with SAD/height ratio (SADHtR) or waist circumference/height ratio (WHtR) have not previously been tested in nationally representative populations. Methods: Nonpregnant adults without diagnosed diabetes (ages 20-64 years; n=3071) provided conventional anthropometry and supine SAD (by sliding-beam caliper) in the 2011-2012 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Population-weighted, logistic models estimated how strongly each anthropometric indicator was associated with 5 cardiometabolic disorders: Dysglycemia (glycated hemoglobin ?5.7%), HyperNonHDLc (non-high-density-lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol ?4.14 mmol/L, or taking anticholesteremic medications), Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ?140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ?90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medications), HyperALT (alanine transaminase ?p75 [75th percentile, sex-specific]), and HyperGGT (gamma-glutamyltransferase ?p75 [sex-specific]). Results: After scaling each indicator, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) tended to be highest for SADHtR and lowest for BMI when identifying each disorder except dysglycemia. When SADHtR entered models simultaneously with BMI, the aORs for BMI no longer directly identified any condition, whereas SADHtR identified persons with HyperNonHDLc by aOR 2.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-4.51), Hypertension by aOR 2.51 (95% CI, 1.22-5.15), HyperALT by aOR 2.89 (95% CI, 1.56-5.37), and HyperGGT by aOR 5.43 (95% CI, 3.01-9.79). WHtR competed successfully against BMI with regard to Dysglycemia, HyperNonHDLc, and HyperGGT. c-Statistics of SADHtR and WHtR were higher than those of BMI (P <.001) for identifying HyperNonHDLc and HyperGGT. Conclusions: Among nonelderly adults, SADHtR or WHtR recognized cardiometabolic disorders better than did the BMI. © 2015.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: AJMEA: Correspondence Address: Kahn, H.S.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945348545&partnerID=40&md5=0180cc7f00293a46f5b396e6102606e7: http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0002934315007846/1-s2.0-S0002934315007846-main.pdf?_tid=9e12586e-8a7b-11e5-967c-00000aab0f02&acdnat=1447470104_280dc7042c5bd74b1732a409f706dd7f","Division of Diabetes Translation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.08.010"

This analysis calculates new estimates from the societal perspective of net cost savings per year associated with mandatory folic acid fortification of enriched cereal grain products in the U.S. that was implemented during 1997-1998. METHODS: Estimates of annual numbers of live-born spina bifida cases in 1995-1996 relative to 1999-2011 based on birth defects surveillance data were combined during 2015 with published estimates of the present value of lifetime direct costs updated in 2014 U.S. dollars for a live-born infant with spina bifida to estimate avoided direct costs and net cost savings. RESULTS: The fortification mandate is estimated to have reduced the annual number of U.S. live-born spina bifida cases by 767, with a lower-bound estimate of 614. The present value of mean direct lifetime cost per infant with spina bifida is estimated to be $791,900, or $577,000 excluding caregiving costs. Using a best estimate of numbers of avoided live-born spina bifida cases, fortification is estimated to reduce the present value of total direct costs for each year's birth cohort by $603 million more than the cost of fortification. A lower-bound estimate of cost savings using conservative assumptions, including the upper-bound estimate of fortification cost, is $299 million. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates of cost savings are larger than previously reported, even using conservative assumptions. The analysis can also inform assessments of folic acid fortification in other countries.","Export Date: 22 January 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: AJPME: Correspondence Address: Grosse, S.D.email: sgrosse@cdc.gov","Not in PubMed","http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84953791543&partnerID=40&md5=f4b528e004e2a04bddbba4e66576479a","National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia: Department of Health Policy and Management, Fay W.

Methods: We analyzed VIGITEL 2011 telephone survey data for 13,745 Brazilian women aged 18-44 years in a probabilistic sample from 26 Brazilian state capitals and the Federal District. We examined associations between NCD risk factors (fruit and vegetable intake, leisure time physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking status, BMI and hypertension status) and race, education, and insurance using chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression models, estimating the average marginal effects to produce adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRs). Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 survey procedures and weighted to reflect population estimates. Results: Women with less than a college education were more likely to report physical inactivity (adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence interval = 1.1 (1.1-1.2)), smoking (aRR = 1.7 (1.3-2.2)), and self-reported diagnoses of hypertension (aRR = 2.0 (1.6-2.5)) compared to women with a college education or greater. Similarly, women without health insurance were more likely to report physical inactivity (aRR = 1.1 (1.1-1.2)), smoking (aRR = 1.4 (1.1-1.8)), and self-reported diagnoses of hypertension aRR = 1.4 (1.1-1.7)) compared to women with health insurance.

Methods: Participants were recruited from patients attending Houston health clinics during 2012-2013. Self-reported data were collected using a questionnaire and compared with medical record data. Agreement of HIV status was assessed using kappa statistics and of HIV test dates using concordance correlation coefficient. The extent of difference between self-reported and medical record test dates was determined. Results: Agreement between self-reported and medical record data was good on HIV status and date of first positive HIV test, but poor on date of last negative HIV test. About half of participants that self-reported never tested had HIV test results in medical records. Agreement varied by sex, race and/or ethnicity, and medical care facility. For HIV-positive persons, more self-reported first positive HIV test dates preceded medical record dates, with a median difference of 6 months. For HIV-negative persons, more medical record dates of last negative HIV test preceded self-reported dates, with a median difference of 2 months.

We quantified the impact of Texas's September 2010 ""pill mill"" law on opioid prescribing and utilization. METHODS: We used the IMS Health LRx LifeLink database to examine anonymized, patient-level pharmacy claims for a closed cohort of individuals filling prescription opioids in Texas between September 2009 and August 2011. Our primary outcomes were derived at a monthly level and included: (1) average morphine equivalent dose (MED) per transaction; (2) aggregate opioid volume; (3) number of opioid prescriptions; and (4) quantity of opioid pills dispensed. We compared observed values with the counterfactual, which we estimated from pre-intervention levels and trends. RESULTS: Texas's pill mill law was associated with declines in average MED per transaction (-0.57. mg/month, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.09, -0.057), monthly opioid volume (-9.99. kg/month, CI -12.86, -7.11), monthly number of opioid prescriptions (-12,200 prescriptions/month, CI -15,300, -9,150) and monthly quantity of opioid pills dispensed (-714,000 pills/month, CI -877,000, -550,000). These reductions reflected decreases of 8.1-24.3% across the outcomes at one year compared with the counterfactual, and they were concentrated among prescribers and patients with the highest opioid prescribing and utilization at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Following the implementation of Texas's 2010 pill mill law, there were clinically significant reductions in opioid dose, volume, prescriptions and pills dispensed within the state, which were limited to individuals with higher levels of baseline opioid prescribing and utilization.","Export Date: 15 January 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: DADED: Correspondence Address: Lyapustina, T.email: tlyapus1@jhmi.edu","Not in PubMed","http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0376871615018402/1-s2.0-S0376871615018402-main.pdf?_tid=bc56b5b4-be37-11e5-b895-00000aacb360&acdnat=1453158409_755a2e7f70b3946fd96204731d892efb","Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 733 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management, 624 N.

To enforce the EMRs minimum requirements for delivery of quality HIV services, the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) developed EMRs standards and guidelines. The standards guided the recommendation of EMRs that met a preset threshold for national roll-out. Methods Using a standards-based checklist, six review teams formed by the MoH EMRs Technical Working Group rated a total of 17 unique EMRs in 28 heath facilities selected by individual owners for their optimal EMR implementation. EMRs with an aggregate score of 60% against checklist criteria were identified by the MoH as suitable for upgrading and rollout to Kenyan public health facilities. Results In Kenya, existing EMRs scored highly in health information and reporting (mean score=71.8%), followed by security, system features, core clinical information, and order entry criteria (mean score=58.1%55.9%), and lowest against clinical decision support (mean score=17.6%) and interoperability criteria (mean score=14.3%). Four EMRs met the 60.0% threshold: OpenMRS, IQ-Care, C-PAD and Funsoft. On the basis of the review, the MoH provided EMRs upgrade plans to owners of all the 17 systems reviewed. Conclusion The standards-based review in Kenya represents an effort to determine level of conformance to the EMRs standards and prioritize EMRs for enhancement and rollout. The results support concentrated use of resources towards development of the four recommended EMRs. Further review should be conducted to determine the effect of the EMR-specific upgrade plans on the other 13 EMRs that participated in the review exercise.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc.: 20164102891559: Checklist: Clinical decision support: Electronic medical record: Electronic medical record system: EMRs: Minimum requirements: Standards and guidelines: Technical working groups",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.09.013","International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH), Department of Global Health, University of Washington, United StatesAfya Bora Consortium in Global Health Leadership, University of Washington, United StatesElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), KenyaUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Global HIV/AIDS (DGHA), Nairobi, KenyaPrivate Consultant, Kenya",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.09.013"

Despite the dangers involved in coal mining, coal is essential to the functioning of our society. Coal provides energy for products, businesses, and homes. Not only is coal mining a dangerous occupation, but, like many other industries, coal mining has also been referred to as a ""graying occupation"" as many coal miners are reaching retirement age. Younger workers possess certain advantages as older workers may have age-associated decrements in cognitive function, health, and recuperative ability. Although there are documented decreases in health and safety associated with age, there are also benefits at the workplace associated with increasing age. Increasing age brings about more experience and familiarity with the work environment. This study used the Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) database on accidents, injury, and illness from the years 2003 through 2007 to examine how age, experience at the current mine, total years experience as a coal miner, and experience in the current job affects injury severity. The results of the data indicated that there was a relationship between age and days lost as well as total mining experience and days lost following an injury. Furthermore, the data indicated an increased risk of overexertion injuries as age increases.

Spherical aerosol particles (polystyrene latex particles (PSL) and droplets of diethylhexyl sebacate (DEHS)) were generated by electrosprays for 100-600. nm particles and by a condensation generator for 700-900. nm particles. Two commercially available diffusion chargers (DCs) (DC2000CE, Ecochem, USA; LQ1-DC, Matter Engineering, Switzerland) were challenged with monodisperse uncharged spherical aerosols. Results showed that the surface areas measured by the two DCs were proportional to mobility diameter to power 1.22 and 1.38, respectively, in the size range from 100 to 900. nm. Comparison of the DC-based surface area with theoretical active surface area resulted in reasonable agreement within 30%, indicating that the DCs underestimate geometric surface area of particles. The deviation of the DC-based surface area from the geometric surface area was quantitatively measured and was found to be up to 94% in the size range studied. Three types of aerosol particles were used to validate the correction of the DC deviation from the geometric surface area for particles larger than 100. nm based on the fit obtained for spherical particles in this study: spherical silver particles, carbon nanofibers, and titanium dioxide agglomerates. Comparison of the corrected DC-based surface area to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)-measured surface area indicated that the DC surface area reasonably agrees with the BET value for the particles tested except carbon nanofibers with 300 nm modal diameter. 2010.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.: Compendex: 20103013105786: Active surface area: Aerosol particles: Brunauer emmett tellers: Condensation generators: Diffusion charger: Diffusion charging: Electrosprays: Geometric surface area: Monodisperse: Polystyrene latex particles: Silver particles: Size ranges: Spherical particle: Submicrometers: Surface area: Switzerland",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V6B-507BHV2-1&_user=856389&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000046148&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=856389&md5=32a66c1f4dfaa404b042ec65d5d0c1d7","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 4676 Columbia Parkway, MS-R3, Cincinnati, OH 45226, United States",,,,,,,,,"Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford, OX5 1GB, United Kingdom",

LEDs could provide useful lives up to 50 times longer than incandescent lighting commonly used in mining and could enable design changes to reduce certain hazards. The mining accident records compiled by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) were examined to determine the extent and nature of accidents involving the maintenance and operation of mine luminaries. A total of 140 relevant accident records were found for the years 2002-2006. These incidents resulted in 3668 days lost from work with an additional 925 days of restricted activity. The injury narratives were studied to determine if the implementation of LED-based luminaries could reduce injury severity and frequency. The greatest near-term potential impacts appear to be related to reducing maintenance and cap lamp redesign. Longer term (5 years), low-power and lightweight auxiliary LED lighting for surface mines could also have potential impact for improving safety.","Author Affiliation: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, P.O.

Five main safety intervention factors (factor A: leadership and accountability; factor B: qualification selection and pre-job; factor C: employee engagement and planning; factor D: work in progress; factor E: evaluation, measurement and verification) were highlighted and investigated to show their effects on incident rate performance. Analysis of variance test showed that four safety factors (A, C, D, and E) were significant. Statistical techniques such as response surface design plots were used to determine the resource allocation method. The developed safety model recommended the allocation of 16.66% of the available resources to the significant safety intervention activities in order to achieve the desirable incident rate.

This paper presents findings from the portion of the environmental investigation focusing on environmental factors related to irrigation water that may have contributed to contamination of the spinach and hence to the outbreak. Analysis of the available data suggests that depths to groundwater and groundwater-surface water interactions may pose risks to ready-to-eat crops. These risks should be further evaluated and quantified to understand and identify the factors that contributed to this and similar outbreaks. One implication of this analysis is the need to continue to conceptually broaden the scope of produce-related outbreak investigations. Where feasible, investigation strategies should integrate possible contamination sources beyond those actually found on the farms that are identified as sources of produce involved in outbreaks.","Author Affiliation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services, Environmental Health Services Branch, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F-60, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA.: Author Email: RGelting@cdc.gov",,,,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Oxford","10.1016/j.agwat.2011.04.004"

The objective was to compare field methods, such as mobility and diffusion charging based approaches, with laboratory approach, such as Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) method used for bulk powder samples. To allow intercomparison of various surface area measurements, we defined 'geometric surface area' of agglomerates (assuming agglomerates are made up of ideal spheres), and compared various surface area measurements to the geometric surface area. Four different approaches for measuring surface area of agglomerate particles in the size range of 60-350. nm were compared using (i) diffusion charging-based sensors from three different manufacturers, (ii) mobility diameter of an agglomerate, (iii) mobility diameter of an agglomerate assuming a linear chain morphology with uniform primary particle size, and (iv) surface area estimation based on tandem mobility-mass measurement and microscopy. Our results indicate that the tandem mobility-mass measurement, which can be applied directly to airborne particles unlike the BET method, agrees well with the BET method. It was also shown that the three diffusion charging-based surface area measurements of silver agglomerates were similar within a factor of 2 and were lower than those obtained from the tandem mobility-mass and microscopy method by a factor of 3-10 in the size range studied.

METHODS: We linked VSM records with CFOI records for 2003 and 2004. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of approximately 11,000 CFOI cases were linked to VSM cases. Linked data suggest that CFOI OIICS event and VSM ICD codes identified similar leading events. However, VSM data were generally less specific. CONCLUSION: Lack of detail inherent in ICD codes and death narratives limits specificity of injury characteristics in VSM data. Appending ICD codes to CFOI appears to offer little value. Research comparing work- and non-work-related events may be better served by having a defined framework to crosswalk both coding schemes to facilitate comparisons. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Over the last two decades, both ICD and OIICS have been used to characterize occupational injury circumstances; however, this is the first study to use linked case comparisons of the OIICS and ICD codes at a detailed level. This study confirmed that multiple source data systems provide more detail surrounding an incident than a single source data system does. Our results suggest that OIICS-coded CFOI data are a better source for occupational injury research and prevention purposes. For future comparison studies requiring ICD, it would be advantageous to have a defined framework that could easily be used to map both coding schemes (OIICS and ICD).","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2012 Elsevier Inc.: 20132716461854: Bureau of Labor Statistics: Classification system: Comparison study: External cause: International classification of disease: Multiple source: Occupational fatality: Occupational injury",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437513000480","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Division of Safety Research, Surveillance and Field Investigations Branch, Morgantown, WV, United States",,,,,,,,,"Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford, OX5 1GB, United Kingdom","10.1016/j.jsr.2013.05.004"

Better tools are needed to identify and study the factors influencing safety-related choices and decision making. METHOD: Using a computer-based task within a behavioral economics paradigm, college students were presented a choice between two hypothetical scenarios that differed in working height and effort associated with retrieving and donning a safety harness. Participants were instructed to choose the scenario in which they were more likely to wear the safety harness. Based on choice patterns, switch points were identified, indicating when the perceived risk in both scenarios was equivalent. RESULTS: Switch points were a systematic function of working height and effort, and the quantified relation between perceived risk and effort was described well by a hyperbolic equation. CONCLUSION: Choice patterns revealed that the perceived risk of working at heights decreased as the effort to retrieve and don a safety harness increased. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Results contribute to the development of computer-based procedure for assessing risk discounting within a behavioral economics framework. Such a procedure can be used as a research tool to study factors that influence safety-related decision making with a goal of informing more effective prevention and intervention strategies.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2012 Elsevier Inc.: 20132716474144: Behavioral economics: College students: Computer-based procedure: Computer-based tasks: Hyperbolic equations: Intervention strategy: Research tools: Safety-Related",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2013.04.006","Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, MP 307, Baltimore MD 21250, United States",,,,,,,,,"Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford, OX5 1GB, United Kingdom","10.1016/j.jsr.2013.04.006"

Typically, as combustion moves from fuel-lean to fuel-rich, aggregate morphologies change from the former to the latter. Accompanying this change in morphology is a change in the chemistry of the aggregates as the percent of carbon in the aggregates also decreases. These combined changes produce radically different scattering and absorption signatures that define their radiative transfer properties. To improve our ability to predict how these optical properties change, experiments were conducted to measure both the physical and optical properties of these aggregates for both flaming and non-flaming modes of combustion. Using the aggregate property data from these experiments, numerical calculations were then performed using both the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (RDG) approximation to generate their characteristic scattering and absorption signatures. This paper presents the experimental results, the comparison of the modeling results with the experimental results and discusses those parameters most important to obtain agreement between the modeling and the experiments.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20142017716692: Aggregate morphology: Carbonaceous aerosol: Discrete dipole approximation: Numerical calculation: Particulate Matter: Rayleigh-Debye-Gans approximations: Scattering and absorption: Spherical structures",,,"National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.fuel.2014.04.043"

Acomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate the flame spread over the conveyor belt in a mine entry. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests were conducted for the conveyor belt and results were used to estimate the kinetic properties for modeling the pyrolysis process of the conveyor belt burning. The CFD model was calibrated using results from the large-scale conveyor belt fire experiments. The comparison between simulation and test results shows that the CFD model is able to capture the major features of the flame spread over the conveyor belt. The predicted maximum heat release rate, and maximum smoke temperature are in good agreement with the large-scale tunnel fire test results. The calibrated CFD model can be used to predict the flame spread over a conveyor belt in a mine entry under different physical conditions and ventilation parameters to aid in the design of improved fire detection and suppression systems, mine rescue, and mine emergency planning.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20142217778366: Calibrated CFD models: Conveyor belt fires: Emergency planning: Flame spread: Maximum heat release rate: Numerical and experimental study: Physical conditions: Suppression systems",,"http://phlic.cdc.gov/docs/ScienceClips/PDFs/6-25-Authors-Yuan.pdf","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, P.O.

The conversion of a series of dicarbonyls to oximes in aqueous solution and from gas-phase sampling was achieved using O-tert-butylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (TBOX). Some advantages of using this derivatization agent include: aqueous reactions, lower molecular weight oximes, and shortened oxime-formation reaction time. Additionally, the TBOX derivatization technique was used to investigate the carbonyl reaction products from limonene ozonolysis. With ozone (O3) as the limiting reagent, four carbonyl compounds were detected: 7-hydroxy-6-oxo-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)heptanal; 3-Isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanal (IPOH), 3-acetyl-6-oxoheptanal (3A6O) and one carbonyl of unknown structure. Using cyclohexane as a hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenger, the relative yields (peak area) of the unknown carbonyl, IPOH, and 3A6O were reduced indicating the influence secondary OH radicals have on limonene ozonolysis products. The relative yield of the hydroxy-dicarbonyl based on the chromatogram was unchanged suggesting it is only made by the limonene+O3 reaction. The detection of 3A6O using TBOX highlights the advantages of a smaller molecular weight derivatization agent for the detection of multi-carbonyl compounds. The use of TBOX derivatization if combined with other derivatization agents may address a recurring need to simply and accurately detect multi-functional oxygenated species in air.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc.: 201444148588: Derivatizations: Ozonolysis",,"Http://intranet.cdc.gov/library/docs/science_clips/vol_6/issue_48/6-48-Authors-Wells.pdf: http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1352231014008048/1-s2.0-S1352231014008048-main.pdf?_tid=8f007f5c-74b7-11e4-b633-00000aacb35e&acdnat=1416929425_fd4910b22c360aab6244566f1a863960","Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown; WV, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.10.015"

These nanomaterials were aerosolized using different generation methods such as electrospray, pneumatic atomization, and dry aerosolization techniques, and their airborne transport properties such as mobility and aerodynamic diameters, mass scaling exponent, dynamic shape factor, and effective density were obtained. Laboratory experiments were conducted to directly measure mobility diameter and mass of the airborne nanomaterials using tandem mobility-mass measurements. Mass scaling exponents, aerodynamic diameters, dynamic shape factors and effective densities of mobility-classified particles were obtained from particle mass and the mobility diameter. Microscopy analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed to obtain morphological descriptors such as envelop diameter, open area, aspect ratio, and projected area diameter. The morphological information from the TEM was compared with measured aerodynamic and mobility diameters of the particles. The results showed that aerodynamic diameter is smaller than mobility diameter below 500 nm by a factor of 2-4 for all nanomaterials except silver and gold nanorods. Morphologies of MWCNTs generated by liquid-based method, such as pneumatic atomization, are more compact than those of dry dispersed MWCNTs, indicating that the morphology depends on particle generation method. TEM analysis showed that projected area diameter of MWCNTs appears to be in reasonable agreement with mobility diameter in the size range from 100 to 400 nm. Principal component analysis of the obtained airborne particle properties also showed that the mobility diameter-based effective density and aerodynamic diameter are eigenvectors and can be used to represent key transport properties of interest. © 2015.","Export Date: 19 October 2015 no PubMed record found: CODEN: JALSB: Correspondence Address: Ku, B.K.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Applied Research and Technology (DART), 1090 Tusculum Ave, MS-R3, United States: References: Anjilvel, S., Asgharian, B., A multiple-path model of particle deposition in the rat lung (1995) Fundamental and Applied Toxicology, 28, pp. 41-50; Baron, P.A., Deye, G.J., Chen, B.T., Schwegler-Berry, D.E., Shvedova, A.A., Castranova, V., Aerosolization of single-walled carbon nanotubes for an inhalation study (2008) Inhalation Toxicology, 20, pp. 751-760; Baughman, R.H., Zakhidov, A.A., de Heer, W.A., Carbon nanotubes-The route toward applications (2002) Science, 297, pp. 787-792; Birch, M.E., Ku, B.K., Evans, D.E., Ruda-Eberenz, T.A., Exposure and emissions monitoring during carbon nanofiber production-Part I: Elemental carbon and iron-soot aerosols (2011) Annals of Occupational Hygiene, 55, pp. 1016-1036; (2015), http://www.cheaptubesinc.com/graphene-nanoplatelets.htmCox, R.G., The motion of long slender bodies in a viscous fluid I: General theory (1970) Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 44, p. 791; De la mora, J.F., Loscertales, I.G., The current emitted by highly conducting Taylor cones (1994) Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 260, pp. 155-184; Ehara, K., Hagwood, C., Coakley, K.J., Novel method to classify aerosol particles according to their mass-to-charge ratio-Aerosol particle mass analyzer (1996) Journal of Aerosol Science, 27, pp. 217-234; Evans, D.E., Ku, B.K., Birch, M.E., Dunn, K.H., Aerosol monitoring during carbon nanofiber production: Mobile direct-reading sampling (2010) Annals of Occupational Hygiene, 52, pp. 9-21; Hajipour, M.J., Fromm, K.M., Ashkarran, A.A., de Aberasturi, D.J., de Larramendi, I.R., Antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (2012) Trends in Biotechnology, 30 (10), pp. 499-511; Hinds, W.C., (1999) Aerosol technology: Properties, behavior, and measurement of airborne particles, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, USA; (1994) Human respiratory tract model for radiological protection, , Pergamon Press, Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford, [ICRP Publication 66]; Kasper, G., Dynamics and measurement of smokes.1.

This study was aimed to determine the performance of HIV combination assays in Taiwan, where the HIV-1 seroprevalence is 0.007% and HIV-2 infection has never been reported. Methods: Performance of three fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combination assays (Dia.Pro, Wantai, and Bio-Rad) and one third-generation HIV Ab immunoassay (AxSYM HIV 1/2 gO) was assessed. Results: A total of 152 specimens, including 86 confirmed HIV-seropositive and 66 HIV-seronegative samples, were used in the study. The sensitivity of four assays varied from 98.8% to 100%, and specificity varied from 98.5% to 100%. Performance of the 75 equivocal samples, the HIV status of which was confirmed later, in terms of negative prediction varied from 81.8% to 87.5%. The Bio-Rad and Dia.Pro assays exhibited higher sensitivity for the detection of p24 antigen among the three fourth-generation HIV combination assays. Conclusion: The three fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combination assays exhibited better sensitivity, specificity, and negative prediction than the third-generation HIV Ab immunoassay. © 2015.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: JMIIF: Correspondence Address: Yang, J.-Y.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945566563&partnerID=40&md5=0c454fe019593df10ba938741d63aaa6: http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1684118215008154/1-s2.0-S1684118215008154-main.pdf?_tid=6c2d0100-8a7b-11e5-9b92-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1447470020_0b31eda93bd7af39e1d260de4f06625f","Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan: Center for Research, Diagnostics and Vaccine Development, Centers for Disease Control, Taipei, Taiwan: Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.jmii.2015.07.009"

The present study is the first of its kind to examine the predictors of treatment attrition and length in a sample of Taiwanese caregivers and their children. It is also the first to examine PCIT outcomes in Taiwanese families. Maladaptive personality characteristics of the caregiver were the best predictor of attrition, followed by single-parent, removal of the child from the home, and lower levels of caregiver education. Treatment length was predicted by child minority status and parent-child interactions (i.e., parent commands and negative parent talk). In terms of outcomes, statistically significant treatment changes were noted for all treatment outcome variables at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. These findings suggest that PCIT is a promising intervention for this population. The predictors of treatment attrition and length can be used when Taiwanese caregiver-child dyads present for services so that additional assistance can be provided prior to or during treatment to increase adherence to the recommended number of treatment sessions for maximal impact. Future studies may replicate the present study with a larger clinical sample to examine the long-term effects of PCIT and to include a no-treatment control condition to afford a more robust empirical evaluation. © 2015.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: CYSRD: Correspondence Address: Chen, Y.-C.; Department of Psychology, National Chung Cheng University, 168 University Rd., Taiwan: References: Abidin, R.R., (1995) Parenting Stress Index: Professional manual, , Psychological Assessment Resources, Odessa, FL; Abrahamse, M.E., Junger, M., Chavannes, E.L., Coelman, F.J.G., Boer, F., Lindauer, R.J.L., Parent-Child Interaction Therapy for preschool children with disruptive behaviour problems in The Netherlands (2012) Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health, 6 (24), pp. 1-9; Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L.A., (2001) Manual for the ASEBA school-age forms and profiles, , University of Vermont, Research Center for Children, Youth, & Families, Burlington, VT; Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L.A., (2007) Multicultural supplement to the manual for the ASEBA school-age forms and profiles, , University of Vermont, Research Center for Children, Youth, & Families, Burlington, VT; Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L.A., (2010) Multicultural supplement to the manual for the ASEBA preschool forms and profiles, , University of Vermont Research Center for Children, Youth, & Families, Burlington, VT; Afifi, A.A., Clark, V., (1996) Computer-aided multivariate analysis, , Chapman & Hall, London; Bagner, D.M., Father's role in parent training for children with developmental delay (2013) Journal of Family Psychology, 27 (4), pp. 650-657; Bagner, D.M., Eyberg, S.M., Parent-Child Interaction Therapy for disruptive behavior in children with mental retardation: A randomized controlled trial (2007) Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 36 (3), pp. 418-429; Beck, A.T., Steer, R.A., (1993) Manual for the Beck Anxiety Inventory, , The Psychological Corporation, San Antonio, TX; Beck, A.T., Steer, R.A., Brown, G.K., (1996) Manual for the Beck Depression Inventory-Second edition (BDI-II), , The Psychological Corporation, San Antonio, TX; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Multiple significance tests: The Bonferroni method (1995) British Medical Journal, 310, p. 170; Boggs, S.R., Eyberg, S.M., Edwards, D.L., Rayfield, A., Jacobs, J., Bagner, D., Hood, K.K., Outcomes of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: A comparison of treatment completers and study dropouts one to three years later (2004) Child & Family Behavior Therapy, 26, pp. 1-22; Capage, L.C., Bennett, G.M., McNeil, C.B., A comparison between African American and Caucasian children referred for treatment of disruptive behavior disorders (2001) Child & Family Behavior Therapy, 23 (1), pp. 1-14; Chaffin, M., Silovsky, J.F., Funderburk, B., Valle, L.A., Brestan, E.V., Balachova, T., Bonner, B.L., Parent-Child Interaction Therapy with physically abusive parents: Efficacy for reducing future abuse reports (2004) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72 (3), pp. 500-510; Chambless, D.L., Ollendick, T.H., Empirically supported psychological interventions: Controversies and evidence (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 685-716; Che, H., Lu, M., Chen, H., Chang, S., Lee, Y., Validation of the Chinese version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (2006) Formosan Journal of Medicine, 10 (4), pp. 447-454; Chen, H., Beck Depression Inventory-II manual (2000), Chinese Behavioral Science Corporation, Taipei, TaiwanChen, Y., Huang, H.L., Chao, C.C., Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) (2009), Psychological Publishing, Taipei, TaiwanChen, Y., Lin, K., Fortson, B.L., Psychometric properties of the Chinese Personality Assessment Screener in a sample of Taiwanese college students (2011) Poster presented at the 45th annual convention of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies, , Ontario, CA, Toronto; Chen, Y., Tseng, K., Fortson, B.L., Psychometric properties of the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System in a clinically referred Taiwanese sample (2013) Poster presented at the Parent-Child Interaction Therapy International Convention, Boston, MA, USA; Cheng, X., (2014), [Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of Personality Assessment Screener in an adult community sample in Taiwan] (Unpublished master's thesis).

This ecological study used sex and race/ethnicity data from the 2010 US Census and household vehicle availability data from the American Community Survey 2008-2012, all at Census tract level. Using the public transportation option on Google Trip Planner we obtained the travel time from the centroid of each census tract to all local mammography facilities to determine the nearest mammography facility in each urban area. Median travel times by public transportation to the nearest facility for women with no household access to a private vehicle were obtained by ranking travel time by population group across all U.S. census tracts in each urban area and across the entire study area. The overall median travel times for each urban area for women without household access to a private vehicle ranged from a low of 15. min in Boston and Philadelphia to 27. min in San Diego. The numbers and percentages of transit marginalized women were then calculated for all urban areas by population group. While black women were less likely to have private vehicle access, and both Hispanic and black women were more likely to be transit marginalized, this outcome varied by urban area. White women constituted the largest number of transit marginalized. Our results indicate that mammography facilities are favorably located for the large majority of women, although there are still substantial numbers for whom travel may likely present a barrier to mammography facility access. © 2015.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Graham, S.",,"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84945940010&partnerID=40&md5=75e26dbf25a48afb1fc5c8c8cdaf31f4: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140515006817","Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA: Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.jth.2015.09.001"

We created a Foster Care Learning Collaborative (FCLC) of 11 foster care health sites to share best practices on providing health services for children in foster care. Using a collaborative approach involving monthly conference calls, we invited each health site to present specific health care delivery issues for the purpose of developing collaborative quality improvement projects regarding the delivery of healthcare to children placed into foster care. For health sites providing primary care (n. =. 8 of 11 sites), we examined adherence to two American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for children entering foster care: a) the initial health screen, and b) the comprehensive medical evaluations. At least four distinct types of health care models that provide either direct primary care or administrative oversight for children in foster care were identified: 1) medical home sites (n. =. 3); 2) foster care evaluation/intake sites (n. =. 2); 3) specialized primary care sites (n. =. 1); and, 4) state administrative programs (n. =. 2). Data from the six direct primary care sites (n. =. 586 children) and two state administrative models (n. =. 3855 children) was collected. The time-frame for the initial health screen was adjusted to 7. days after entry and adherence (31%) was comparable among primary care sites. Adherence to AAP guidelines regarding completion of a comprehensive medical evaluation within 30. days of intake varied among medical homes (30%-86%), intake models (23%-33%), specialized primary care site (43%), and state models (43%-73%). No site was fully compliant with the AAP guideline for universal comprehensive medical evaluation within 30. days, and there is variation within and among care models. A foster care learning collaborative identified significant variability in adherence to a commonly accepted guideline for timely access to healthcare for children placed into foster care.

Methods Data come from the Second Injury Control and Risk Survey, Phase 2 (ICARIS2-P2), conducted from March 2007 to May 2008. Prevalence estimates were calculated for older adults (aged ? 65) and multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations between assistive device use and mobility-related characteristics. Result Compared with non-users, assistive device users were more likely to report a recent fall (AOR 12.0; 95% CI 4.9-29.3), limit walking outside due to concerns about falling (AOR 7.1; 95% CI 2.6-19.1), be unable to walk outside for 10 min without resting (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.1-9.3), and be no longer driving (AOR 6.7; 95% CI 2.0-22.3). Conclusion Assistive device users have limited mobility and an increased risk for fall injury compared with non-users. Practical Application Effective fall prevention interventions, and innovative transportation options, are needed to protect the mobility of this high-risk group.","Export Date: 2 December 2015  No PubMed Record found 12/3/2015: CODEN: JSFRA: Correspondence Address: West, B.A.; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mailstop F-62, 4770 Buford Highway NE, United States: References: Andersen, D.A., Roos, B.A., Stanziano, D.C., Gonzalez, N.M., Signorile, J.F., Walker use, but not falls, is associated with lower physical functioning and health of residents in an assisted-living environment (2007) Clinical Interventions in Aging, 2 (1), pp. 123-137; Bailey, L., (2004) Aging Americans: Stranded Without Options, , Surface Transportation Policy Project Washington, DC; Bateni, H., Maki, B.E., Assistive devices for balance and mobility: Benefits, demands, and adverse consequences (2005) Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 86 (1), pp. 134-145; Bateni, H., Heung, E., Zettel, J., McLlroy, W.E., Maki, B.E., Can use of walkers or canes impede lateral compensatory stepping movements?

However, a proper definition or quantification of ""light blast of air"" is not provided. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has, consequently, designed a dust dispersion chamber to conduct quantitative laboratory-scale dispersibility experiments as a screening tool for candidate rock dusts. A reproducible pulse of air is injected into the chamber and across a shallow tray of rock dust. The dust dispersed and carried downwind is monitored. The mass loss of the dust tray and the airborne dust measurements determine the relative dispersibility of the dust with respect to a Reference rock dust. This report describes the design and the methodology to evaluate the relative dispersibility of rock dusts with and without anti-caking agents. Further, the results of this study indicate that the dispersibility of rock dusts varies with particle size, type of anti-caking agent used, and with the untapped bulk density.

This discrepancy is primarily due to failure to address the specific needs of ALHIV and resulting poor clinical outcomes related to late diagnosis and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The Families Matter! Program (FMP) is an evidence-based intervention for parents and caregivers of 9-12. year-olds that promotes positive parenting practices and effective parent-child communication about sexuality and sexual risk reduction. It is delivered to groups of participants at the community level through a series of six weekly three-hour sessions. Recognizing family and community members' need for guidance on issues specific to ALHIV, we developed a seventh FMP session to address their needs. Key themes treated in the curriculum for this session include: stigma and mental health, disclosure, ART adherence and self-care, and responsible sexual relationships. In developing the curriculum, we drew on narratives about growing up with HIV contributed by young Africans to a 2013 scriptwriting competition. We describe the data-driven process of developing this curriculum with a view to informing the development of much-needed interventions to serve this vulnerable population.","Export Date: 15 January 2016: CODEN: CYSRD: Correspondence Address: Winskell, K.; Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory UniversityUnited States; email: swinske@emory.edu: References: Bakeera-Kitaka, S., Nabukeera-Barungi, N., Nostlinger, C., Addy, K., Colebunders, R., Sexual risk reduction needs of adolescents living with HIV in a clinical care setting (2008) AIDS Care, 20 (4), pp. 426-433; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Beyeza-Kashesya, J., Kaharuza, F., Ekstrom, A.M., Neema, S., Kulane, A., Mirembe, F., To use or not to use a condom: A prospective cohort study comparing contraceptive practices among HIV-infected and HIV-negative youth in Uganda (2011) BMC Infectious Diseases, 11 (144); Bikaako-Kajura, W., Luyirika, E., Purcell, D.W., Downing, J., Kaharuza, F., Mermin, J., Bunnell, R., Disclosure of HIV status and adherence to daily drug regimens among HIV-infected children in Uganda (2006) AIDS and Behavior, 10 (1), pp. 85-93; Birungi, H., Obare, F., Mugisha, J.F., Evelia, H., Nyombi, J., Preventive service needs of young people perinatally infected with HIV in Uganda (2009) AIDS Care, 21 (6), pp. 725-731; Busza, J., Besana, G.V., Mapunda, P., Oliveras, E., ""I have grown up controlling myself a lot.""

We aimed to establish whether a CDSS that supports detection of immunological treatment failure among patients with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) would improve appropriate and timely action. METHODS:  We did this prospective, cluster randomised controlled trial in adults and children (aged ?18 months) who were eligible for, and receiving, ART at HIV clinics in Siaya County, western Kenya. Health facilities were randomly assigned (1:1), via block randomisation (block size of two) with a computer-generated random number sequence, to use electronic health records either alone (control) or with CDSS (intervention). Facilities were matched by type and by number of patients enrolled in HIV care. The primary outcome measure was the difference between groups in the proportion of patients who experienced immunological treatment failure and had a documented clinical action. We used generalised linear mixed models with random effects to analyse clustered data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01634802. FINDINGS:  Between Sept 1, 2012, and Jan 31, 2014, 13 clinics, comprising 41 062 patients, were randomly assigned to the control group (n=6) or the intervention group (n=7). Data collection at each site took 12 months. Among patients eligible for ART, 10 358 (99%) of 10 478 patients were receiving ART at control sites and 10 991 (99%) of 11 028 patients were receiving ART at intervention sites. Of these patients, 1125 (11%) in the control group and 1342 (12%) in the intervention group had immunological treatment failure, of whom 332 (30%) and 727 (54%), respectively, received appropriate action. The likelihood of clinicians taking appropriate action on treatment failure was higher with CDSS alerts than with no decision support system (adjusted odds ratio 3·18, 95% CI 1·02-9·87). INTERPRETATION:  CDSS significantly improved the likelihood of appropriate and timely action on immunological treatment failure. We expect our findings will be generalisable to virological monitoring of patients with HIV receiving ART once countries implement the 2015 WHO recommendation to scale up viral load monitoring.","Export Date: 28 January 2016: Article in Press: Correspondence Address: Oluoch, T.email: toluoch@cdc.gov","Not in PubMed","http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84954286870&partnerID=40&md5=0b77a49aaa6776d82b8c7e7649bbc60d","Division of Global HIV/AIDS, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Nairobi, Kenya: Atlanta, GA, USA: Kenya Medical Research Institute-CDC Collaborative Program, Kisumu, Kenya: University of California, San Francisco, Nairobi, Kenya: Department of Medical Informatics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands: Department of Biomedical Engineering, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/S2352-3018(15)00242-8"

With ozone (O3) as the limiting reagent, five carbonyl compounds were detected. The yields of the carbonyl compounds are discussed with and without the presence of a hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenger, giving insight into the influence secondary OH radicals have on limonene ozonolysis products. The observed reaction product yields for limonaketone (LimaKet), 7-hydroxyl-6-oxo-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)heptanal (7H6O), and 2-acetyl-5-oxohexanal (2A5O) were unchanged suggesting OH generated by the limonene + O3reaction does not contribute to their formation. The molar yields of 3-isopropenyl-6-oxo-heptanal (IPOH) and 3-acetyl-6-oxoheptanal (3A6O) decreased by 68% and 95%; respectively, when OH was removed. This suggests that OH radicals significantly impact the formation of these products. Nitric oxide (NO) did not significantly affect the molar yields of limonaketone or IPOH. However, NO (20 ppb) considerably decreased the molar reaction product yields of 7H6O (62%), 2A5O (63%), and 3A6O (47%), suggesting NO reacted with peroxyl intermediates, generated during limonene ozonolysis, to form other carbonyls (not detected) or organic nitrates. These studies give insight into the transformation of limonene and its reaction products that can lead to indoor exposures.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc.: 20161202120589: Derivatizations: Gas-phase reactions: Hydroxyl radicals: Indoor exposure: OH radical: Organic nitrates: Ozonolysis: Ozonolysis products",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.003","Exposure Assessment Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1095 Willowdale Road Morgantown, WV, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.003"

To reduce the hazard of CO poisoning in underground mines, it is important to accurately predict the spread of CO in underground mine entries when a fire occurs. This paper presents a study on modeling CO spread in underground mine fires using both the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and the MFIRE programs. The FDS model simulating part of the mine ventilation network was calibrated using CO concentration data from full-scale mine fire tests. The model was then used to investigate the effect of airflow leakage on CO concentration reduction in the mine entries. The inflow of fresh air at the leakage location was found to cause significant CO reduction. MFIRE simulation was conducted to predict the CO spread in the entire mine ventilation network using both a constant heat release rate and a dynamic fire source created from FDS. The results from both FDS and MFIRE simulations are compared and the implications of the improved MFIRE capability are discussed.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc.: 20161302157856: CO concentrations: Fire dynamics simulator: Heat Release Rate (HRR): Leakage locations: Mine ventilation network: Study on models: Underground mine: Underground mine fires",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.03.007","Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh; PA, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.03.007"

The sum total of the exposure assessment findings combined with preliminary toxicology results allows for exposure-informed toxicological study design and the findings can then be integrated, together with available epidemiologic data, to provide health effect relevance. With regard to engineered nanomaterial inhalation toxicology in particular, a single type of material (e.g. carbon nanotube, graphene) can have a vast array of physicochemical characteristics resulting in the potential for varying toxicities. To compound the matter, the methodologies necessary to establish a material adequate for in vivo exposure testing raises questions on the applicability of the outcomes. From insights gained from evaluating carbon nanotubes, we recommend the following integrated approach involving exposure-informed hazard assessment and hazard-informed exposure assessment especially for materials as diverse as engineered nanomaterials: 1) market-informed identification of potential hazards and potentially exposed populations, 2) initial toxicity screening to drive prioritized assessments of exposure, 3) development of exposure assessment-informed chronic and sub-chronic in vivo studies, and 4) conduct of exposure- and hazard-informed epidemiological studies.","Export Date: 13 May 2016: Article in Press: CODEN: JALSB: Correspondence Address: Erdely, A.email: efi4@cdc.gov",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964870190&partnerID=40&md5=a85a2048b5ee36ff01eecf592e67fdb4","Health Effects Laboratory Division, NIOSH/HELD/PPRB, 1095 Willowdale Rd, MS-2015, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA: Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, OH 45226, USA: Respiratory Health Division, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.jaerosci.2016.03.005"

Our study estimated the prevalence of work-site injuries and investigated the association between obesity and work-site injury in a nationally representative sample of U.S. workers. Methods: Self-reported weight, height, and injuries within the previous three months were collected annually for U.S. workers in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2004-2012. Participants were categorized as normal weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI: 25.0-29.9), obese I (BMI: 30.0-34.9), and obese II (BMI: 35 +). The prevalence of injury and prevalence ratios from fitted logistic regression models was used to assess relationships between obesity and injury after adjusting for covariates. Sampling weights were incorporated using SUDAAN software. Results: During the 9-year study period from 2004 to 2012, 1120 workers (78 workers per 10,000) experienced a work-related injury during the previous three months. The anatomical sites with the highest prevalence of injury were the back (14.3/10,000 1.2), fingers (11.5 1.3), and knees (7.1 0.8). The most common types of injuries were sprains/strains/twists (41.5% of all injuries), cuts (20.0%), and fractures (11.8%). Compared to normal weight workers, overweight and obese workers were more likely to experience work-site injuries [overweight: PR = 1.25 (95% CI = 1.04-1.52); obese I: 1.41 (1.14-1.74); obese II: 1.68 (1.32-2.14)]. These injuries were more likely to affect the lower extremities [overweight: PR = 1.48, (95% CI = 1.03-2.13); obese I: 1.70 (1.13-2.55); obese II: 2.91 (1.91-4.41)] and were more likely to be due to sprains/strains/twists [overweight: PR = 1.73 (95% CI = 1.29-2.31); obese I: PR = 2.24 (1.64-3.06); obese II: PR = 2.95 (2.04-4.26)]. Conclusions: Among NHIS participants, overweight and obese workers were 25% to 68% more likely to experience injuries than normal weight workers. Practical applications: Weight reduction policies and management programs may be effectively targeted towards overweight and obese groups to prevent or reduce work-site injuries. 2016 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

A systematic analysis of all off-road truck-related accidents, injuries, and illnesses, which are reported and published by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), is expected to provide practical insights for identifying the accident patterns and trends in the available raw database. Therefore, appropriate safety management measures can be administered and implemented based on these accident patterns/trends. Methods A hybrid clustering-classification methodology using K-means clustering and gene expression programming (GEP) is proposed for the analysis of severe and non-severe off-road truck-related injuries at U.S. mines. Using the GEP sub-model, a small subset of the 36 recorded attributes was found to be correlated to the severity level. Results Given the set of specified attributes, the clustering sub-model was able to cluster the accident records into 5 distinct groups. For instance, the first cluster contained accidents related to minerals processing mills and coal preparation plants (91%). More than two-thirds of the victims in this cluster had less than 5 years of job experience. This cluster was associated with the highest percentage of severe injuries (22 severe accidents, 3.4%). Almost 50% of all accidents in this cluster occurred at stone operations. Similarly, the other four clusters were characterized to highlight important patterns that can be used to determine areas of focus for safety initiatives. Conclusions The identified clusters of accidents may play a vital role in the prevention of severe injuries in mining. Further research into the cluster attributes and identified patterns will be necessary to determine how these factors can be mitigated to reduce the risk of severe injuries. Practical application Analyzing injury data using data mining techniques provides some insight into attributes that are associated with high accuracies for predicting injury severity.","Export Date: 11 August 2016: CODEN: JSFRA: Correspondence Address: Dindarloo, S.R.226 McNutt Hall, 1400 N.

In this third phase of the study, researchers compared plastic wedge crush-induced internal short circuit tests of selected lithium-ion cells within methane (CH4)-air mixtures with accelerated rate calorimetry tests of similar cells. Plastic wedge crush test results with metal oxide lithium-ion cells extracted from intrinsically safe evaluated equipment were mixed, with one cell model igniting the chamber atmosphere while another cell model did not. The two cells models exhibited different internal short circuit behaviors. A lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cell model was tolerant to crush-induced internal short circuits within CH4-air, tested under manufacturer recommended charging conditions. Accelerating rate calorimetry tests with similar cells within a nitrogen purged 353-mL chamber produced ignitions that exceeded explosion proof and flameproof enclosure minimum internal pressure design criteria. Ignition pressures within a 20-L chamber with 6.5% CH4-air were relatively low, with much larger head space volume and less adiabatic test conditions. The literature indicates that sizeable lithium thionyl chloride (LiSOCl2) primary (non rechargeable) cell ignitions can be especially violent and toxic. Because ignition of an explosive atmosphere is expected within explosion proof or flameproof enclosures, there is a need to consider the potential for an internal explosive atmosphere ignition in combination with a lithium or lithium-ion battery thermal runaway process, and the resulting effects on the enclosure.","Export Date: 11 August 2016: CODEN: JLPIE: Correspondence Address: Dubaniewicz, T.H.; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, 626 Cochrans Mill Rd, United States; email: tcd5@cdc.gov: References: Boring, R.C., Beasley, W.C., Bedway, B.F., Murtaugh, S.M., Warnock, W.S., Report of Investigation - Part 6 Equivalency Review and Comparison: MSHA and IEC Explosion-proof Enclosure Standards (2005), http://arlweb.msha.gov/Part6SingleSource/IEC_MSHA_Report.pdf, U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Directorate of Technical Support, Approval and Certification Center Triadelphia WV Retrieved July 2016, fromConroe fire department, Incident Number 11–0084992.

Individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) is a potential confounder of the estimated effectiveness of PCV13 and is often controlled for in observational studies using zip code as a proxy. We assessed the utility of zip code matching for control of SES in a post-licensure evaluation of the effectiveness of PCV13 (calculated as [1-matched odds ratio]*100). We used a directed acyclic graph to identify subsets of confounders and collected SES variables from birth certificates, geocoding, a parent interview, and follow-up with medical providers. Cases tended to be more affluent than eligible controls (for example, 48.3% of cases had private insurance vs. 44.6% of eligible controls), but less affluent than enrolled controls (52.9% of whom had private insurance). Control of confounding subsets, however, did not result in a meaningful change in estimated vaccine effectiveness (original estimate: 85.1%, 95% CI 74.8–91.9%; adjusted estimate: 82.5%, 95% CI 65.6–91.1%). In the context of a post-licensure vaccine effectiveness study, zip code appears to be an adequate, though not perfect, proxy for individual SES.","Export Date: 2 September 2016: Correspondence Address: Link-Gelles, R.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, MS C-25, United States; email: ruth.linkgelles@cdc.hhs.gov: References: Phelan, J.C., Link, B.G., Controlling disease and creating disparities: a fundamental cause perspective (2005) The Journals of Gerontology Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 60, pp. 27-33; Braveman, P., Cubbin, C., Marchi, K., Egerter, S., Chavez, G., Measuring socioeconomic status/position in studies of racial/ethnic disparities: maternal and infant health (2001) Public Health Reports, 116, pp. 449-463; Janssen, I, Boyce, W.F., Simpson, K., Pickett, W., Influence of individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic status on obesity, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity in Canadian adolescents (2006) American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 83, pp. 139-145; Burton, D.C., Flannery, B., Bennett, N.M., Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic pneumonia among US adults (2010) American Journal of Public Health, 100, pp. 1904-1911; Cohen, S., Doyle, W.J., Baum, A., Socioeconomic status is associated with stress hormones (2006) Psychosom Med, 68, pp. 414-420; Iwane, M.K., Chaves, S.S., Szilagyi, P.G., Disparities between black and white children in hospitalizations associated with acute respiratory illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in 3 US counties-?2002-2009 (2013) American Journal of Epidemiology, 177, pp. 656-665; Lantz, P.M., House, J.S., Mero, R.P., Williams, D.R., Stress, life events, and socioeconomic disparities in health: results from the Americans’ Changing Lives Study (2005) Journal of Health Social Behaviour, 46, pp. 274-288; Spicer, J.O., Thomas, S., Holst, A., Baughman, W., Farley, M.M., Socioeconomic and racial disparities of pediatric invasive pneumococcal disease after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (2014) The PediatriC Infectious Disease Journal, 33, pp. 158-164; Pardo-Crespo, M.R., Narla, N.P., Williams, A.R., Comparison of individual-level versus area-level socioeconomic measures in assessing health outcomes of children in Olmsted County, Minnesota (2013) Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 67, pp. 305-310; Krieger, N., Chen, J.T., Waterman, P.D., Rehkopf, D.H., Subramanian, S.V., Race/ethnicity, gender, and monitoring socioeconomic gradients in health: a comparison of area-based socioeconomic measures–the public health disparities geocoding project (2003) American Journal of Public Health, 93, pp. 1655-1671; Krieger, N., Chen, J.T., Kosheleva, A., Waterman, P.D., Not just smoking and high-tech medicine: socioeconomic inequities in U.S. mortality rates, overall and by race/ethnicity, 1960–2006 (2012) International Journal of Health Service, 42, pp. 293-322; Krieger, N., Singh, N., Chen, J.T., Why history matters for quantitative target setting: long-term trends in socioeconomic and racial/ethnic inequities in US infant death rates (1960–2010) (2015) Journal of Public Health Policy, 36, pp. 287-303; VanderWeele, T.J., Robinson, W.R., On the causal interpretation of race in regressions adjusting for confounding and mediating variables (2014) Epidemiology, 25, pp. 473-484; Krieger, N., Chen, J.T., Waterman, P.D., Rehkopf, D.H., Subramanian, S.V., Painting a truer picture of US socioeconomic and racial/ethnic health inequalities: the Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project (2005) American Journal of Public Health, 95, pp. 312-323; Braveman, P.A., Cubbin, C., Egerter, S., Socioeconomic status in health research: one size does not fit all (2005) Jama, 294, pp. 2879-2888; Williams, D.R., Race, socioeconomic status, and health.

Bicyclist deaths increased by 19% from 2010 to 2013. The greatest risk of death and disability to bicyclists is head injuries. The objective of this study was to provide estimates of prevalence and associated factors of bicycle riding and helmet use among children and adults in the United States. Method CDC analyzed self-reported data from the 2012 Summer ConsumerStyles survey. Adult respondents (18+years) were asked about bicycle riding and helmet use in the last 30days for themselves and their children (5 to 17years). For bicycle riders, CDC estimated the prevalence of helmet use and conducted multivariable regression analyses to identify factors associated with helmet use. Results Among adults, 21% rode bicycles within the past 30days and 29% always wore helmets. Respondents reported that, of the 61% of children who rode bicycles within the past 30days, 42% always wore helmets. Children were more likely to always wear helmets (90%) when their adult respondents always wore helmets than when their adult respondents did not always wear helmets (38%). Children who lived in states with a child bicycle helmet law were more likely to always wear helmets (47%) than those in states without a law (39%). Conclusions Despite the fact that bicycle helmets are highly effective at reducing the risk for head injuries, including severe brain injuries and death, less than half of children and adults always wore bicycle helmets while riding. Practical application States and communities should consider interventions that improve the safety of riding such as policies to promote helmet use, modeling of helmet wearing by adults, and focusing on high risk groups, including Hispanic cyclists, occasional riders, adults, and children ages 10 to 14.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc.: 20164302940118: Adults: Bicycle helmet: Bicycle riders: Children: Emergency departments: Head injuries: Helmet: Multivariable regression analysis",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2016.09.001","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, Atlanta; GA, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.jsr.2016.09.001"

This study sought to determine how children (5-18. years) travel to and from school and, among those living </= 1. mile of school, to explore the role of school bus service eligibility on school travel mode. Methods: We used national 2012 survey data to determine prevalence of usual school travel mode, stratified by distance from school. For those living </= 1. mile of school, multivariable regression was conducted to assess the association between bus service eligibility and walking or bicycling. Results: Almost half (46.6%) of all children rode in passenger vehicles (PV) to school and 41.8% did so for the trip home. Results were similar among those living </= 1. mile (48.1%, PV to school; 41.3%, PV to home). Among those living </= 1. mile, 21.9% and 28.4% of children walked or bicycled to and from school, respectively. Ineligibility for school bus service was strongly associated with walking or bicycling to school [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR: 5.36; p. < 0.001)] and from school (aPR: 5.36; p. < 0.001). Conclusions: Regardless of distance from school, passenger vehicles were a common mode of travel. For children who live close to school, the role that school bus service eligibility plays in walking or bicycling deserves further consideration. Practical applications: Given the large proportion of children who use passenger vehicles for school travel, effective interventions can be adopted to increase proper child restraint and seat belt use and reduce crash risks among teen drivers. Better understanding of conditions under which bus service is offered to children who live close to school could inform efforts to improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety for school travel.","Export Date: 13 May 2017: Article in Press: CODEN: JSFRA: Correspondence Address: Beck, L.F.email: LDF8@cdc.gov",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437517302153","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 4770 Buford Hwy NE, MS F62, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA: Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.jsr.2017.04.001"

In this study, we recorded ground impact forces and postural sway from 22 construction workers while they performed ingress and egress between a scissor lift and an adjacent work surface with varying conditions: lift opening designs, horizontal and vertical gaps, and sloped work surfaces. We observed higher peak ground shear forces when using a bar-and-chain opening, with larger horizontal gap, with the lift surface more than 0.2 m below the work surface, and presence of a sloped (26) work surface. Similar trends were observed for postural sway, except that the influence of vertical distance was not significant. To reduce slip/trip/fall risk and postural sway of workers while ingress or egress of an elevated scissor lift, we suggest scissor lifts be equipped with a gate-type opening instead of a bar-and-chain design. We also suggest the lift surface be placed no more than 0.2 m lower than the work surface and the horizontal gap between lift and work surfaces be as small as possible.

A previous study using MTF data reported substantial declines in the proportion of high school seniors that were licensed to drive and increases in the proportion of nondrivers following the recent U.S. economic recession. Method To explore whether licensure and driving patterns among U.S. high school seniors have rebounded in the post-recession years, we analyzed MTF licensure and driving data for the decade of 20062015. We also examined trends in teen driver involvement in fatal and nonfatal injury crashes for that decade using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System, respectively. Results During 20062015, the proportion of high school seniors that reported having a driver's license declined by 9 percentage points (11%) from 81% to 72% and the proportion that did not drive during an average week increased by 8 percentage points (44%) from 18% to 26%. The annual proportion of black seniors that did not drive was consistently greater than twice the proportion of nondriving white seniors. Overall during the decade, 17- and 18-year-old drivers experienced large declines in fatal and nonfatal injury crashes, although crashes increased in both 2014 and 2015. Conclusions The MTF data indicate that licensure and driving patterns among U.S. high school seniors have not rebounded since the economic recession. The recession had marked negative effects on teen employment opportunities, which likely influenced teen driving patterns. Possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies between the MTF data and the 2014 and 2015 increases in crashes are explored. Practical applications MTF will continue to be an important resource for clarifying teen driving trends in relation to crash trends and informing strategies to improve teen driver safety.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.:20172803939355:Adolescent:Automobile driving:Licensure:Motor vehicle crashes:Teenagers",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437517301688?via%3Dihub","Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway, NE, MS F-62, Atlanta; GA; 30341, United StatesLLC, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.jsr.2017.06.013"

Methods Using data from the 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 38 states, we examined teens' self-reported seat belt use while riding as a passenger and identified individual characteristics and environmental factors associated with always wearing a seat belt. Results Only 51% of high school students living in 38 states reported always wearing a seat belt when riding as a passenger; prevalence varied from 32% in South Dakota to 65% in Delaware. Seat belt use was 11 percentage points lower in states with secondary enforcement seat belt laws compared to states with primary enforcement laws. Racial/ethnic minorities, teens living in states with secondary enforcement seat belt laws, and those engaged in substance use were least likely to always wear their seat belts. The likelihood of always being belted declined steadily as the number of substance use behaviors increased. Discussion Seat belt use among teens in the United States remains unacceptably low. Results suggest that environmental influences can compound individual risk factors, contributing to even lower seat belt use among some subgroups. Practical applications This study provides the most comprehensive state-level estimates to date of seat belt use among U.S. teens. This information can be useful when considering policy options to increase seat belt use and for targeting injury prevention interventions to high-risk teens. States can best increase teen seat belt use by making evidence-informed decisions about state policy options and prevention strategies. © 2016 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

Green building materials, derived from renewable sources, are increasingly utilized in construction and renovations. However, the question as to what fungi will grow on these green compared to non-green materials, after they get wet, has not been adequately studied. By determining what fungi grow on each type of material, the potential health risks can be more adequately assessed. In this study, we inoculated green and non-green pieces of ceiling tile, composite board, drywall, and flooring with indoor dust containing a complex mixture of naturally occurring fungi. The materials were saturated with water and incubated for two months in a controlled environment. The resulting fungal microbiomes were evaluated using ITS amplicon sequencing. Overall, the richness and diversity of the mycobiomes on each pair of green and non-green pieces were not significantly different. However, different genera dominated on each type of material. For example, Aspergillus spp. had the highest relative abundance on green and non-green ceiling tiles and green composite boards, but Peniophora spp. dominated the non-green composite board. In contrast, Penicillium spp. dominated green and non-green flooring samples. Green gypsum board was dominated by Phialophora spp. and Stachybotrys spp., but non-green gypsum board by Myrothecium spp. These data suggest that water-damaged green and non-green building materials can result in mycobiomes that are dominated by fungal genera whose member species pose different potentials for health risks.","Export Date: 19 August 2017:Article in Press:CODEN: IBBIE:Correspondence Address: Reponen, T.email: Tiina.Reponen@uc.edu",,"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964830517304158?via%3Dihub","Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati, P.O.

However, gray literature reports suggest that barriers exist to getting alternate sized PPE from the manufacturer to the workers who need it. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which alternative-sized PPE is marketed. Method A web-based review of seven major manufacturers of PPE was conducted to determine: (a) whether or not they offer alternative-sized products, (b) if these products are clearly labeled, and (c) if images used to display PPE are representative of a diverse workforce. Results Of the seven PPE manufacturers investigated, six had at least one product that was marketed as gender and/or size alternatives however, alternative sizes were more common for larger body types. Alternative-sized products rarely included size charts, and the models used to display PPE were overwhelmingly white males of average size. Conclusions Despite the growing availability of alternative-sized PPE, it can be difficult to find these products, which suggests that they are rarely promoted or labeled as alternative-sized. Our study indicates that companies should expand their product lines and more aggressively market and promote these items. Guidance on how to properly fit their products would also be extremely helpful to the end-user. Practical applications Manufacturers could improve the availability of alternative-sized PPE and increase their promotion of these products on their websites and in their catalogs. Individual companies and safety professionals may assist in this process by demonstrating demand for alternative-sized PPE.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.:20173604132652:Average size:Foot protection:Occupational safety and health:Personal protective equipment:Product-lines:Safety harness:Safety professionals:Workforce diversity",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2017.08.004","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 1090 Tusculum Ave. M/S C-10, Cincinnati; OH; 45226, United StatesDepartment of Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Section of Public Health Nursing, Central Office, P.O.

The purpose of this effort was to gain a better understanding of the U.S. driving population's perceptions and thoughts about the impacts of lowering the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) driving standard below.08% on AID, health, and other outcomes. Methods A questionnaire was administered to a nationally representative sample of licensed drivers in the U.S. (n = 1011) who were of age 21 or older on driving habits, alcohol consumption habits, drinking and driving habits, attitudes about drinking and driving, experiences with and opinions of drinking and driving laws, opinions about strategies to reduce drinking and driving, general concerns about traffic safety issues, and demographics. Results One-third of participants supported lowering the legal BAC standard, and participants rated a BAC standard of.05% to be moderately acceptable on average. 63.9% indicated that lowering 30 the BAC to.05% would have no effect on their decisions to drink and drive. Nearly 60% of respondents lacked accurate knowledge of their state's BAC standard. Conclusions Public support for lowering the BAC standard was moderate and was partially tied to beliefs about the impacts of a change in the BAC standard. The results suggest that an opportunity for better educating the driving population about existing AID policy and the implications for lowering the BAC level on traffic injury prevention. Practical applications The study results are useful for state traffic safety professionals and policy makers to have a better understanding of the public's perceptions of and thoughts about BAC standards. There is a clear need for more research into the effects of lowering the BAC standard on crashes, arrests, AID behavior, and alcohol-related behaviors.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.:20173704155056:Alcohol consumption:Blood-alcohol concentration:Drink driving:Drinking and driving:Licensed drivers:Representative sample:Traffic injury prevention:Traffic safety",,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2017.08.013","University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, United StatesUniversity of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, United StatesDivision of Unintentional Injury Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States",,,,,,,,,,"10.1016/j.jsr.2017.08.013"

In addition, elevated triglycerides are known to be associated with pancreatitis. Though less clear, it is possible that dyslipidemias may also contribute to risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Ethinyl estradiol and progestogen, contained within combined hormonal contraception, are known to impact lipid metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate from the literature whether use of combined hormonal contraception (CHC), including combined oral contraception (COC) pills, transdermal patch, vaginal ring or injectables, modifies the relative risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, VTE or pancreatitis among women with known dyslipidemias and to determine if existing lipid abnormalities worsen with CHC use. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for all articles in all languages published between inception and September 2014 relevant to dyslipidemia, CHC use and serious adverse events (MI, stroke, VTE or pancreatitis). The quality of each individual study was assessed using the system for grading evidence developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. RESULTS: From 306 articles identified by our search strategy, 3 articles met inclusion criteria. In a poor-quality case-control study, women with hypercholesterolemia but no COC use had an increased risk of MI (adjusted odds ratio [adj OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-6.8), as did women who used COCs but did not have hypercholesterolemia (adj OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.8), compared with non-COC users without hypercholesterolemia; women with both COC use and hypercholesterolemia had an adjusted OR of 24.7 (95% CI 5.6-108.5) compared with women with neither risk factor. A poor-quality cohort study examined COC users and reported that women with dyslipidemia had increased risk for VTE [crude risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.04-1.85] and transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.51-2.06) compared to those without dyslipidemia. Another poor-quality cohort study provided direct evidence on changes in lipid levels among COC users with dyslipidemia. A minority of women with elevated total cholesterol or triglyceride levels at baseline showed normal results (25% and 28%, respectively) after 6 cycles of COC use. No evidence regarding risks associated with use of other CHC methods was identified. No evidence was identified for the outcome of pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data from poor-quality observational studies suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using CHC may be at increased risk for MI and may experience a minimal increase in risk for CVA or VTE. No evidence was identified on risk for pancreatitis in this context. The impact of CHC exposure on the status of lipid abnormalities over time, an intermediate marker for disease, is also unclear. Given the significant limitations of this body of evidence, the importance of access to effective contraception and theoretical concerns raised about the use of CHCs by women with known dyslipidemias, additional rigorous studies are needed to best estimate true associations. Contraceptive decision making should include consideration of both the known and theoretical risks of a given CHC method, safety and acceptability of alternative contraceptive methods, and risks associated with unintended pregnancy.","Export Date: 1 October 2015: Article in Press: CODEN: CCPTA: Correspondence Address: Dragoman, M.",,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272309/?otool=cdciclib","Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland: Division of Reproductive Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA",,,,,,"Scopus",,"English",,"10.1016/j.contraception.2015.08.002"

Methods Health center partner baseline data were collected in the first year (2011) and before program implementation of a 5-year community-wide teen pregnancy prevention initiative. A needs assessment on health center capacity and implementation of evidence-based clinical practices was administered with 51 health centers partners in 10 communities in the United States with high rates of teen pregnancy. Results Health centers reported inconsistent implementation of evidence-based clinical practices in providing reproductive health services to adolescents. Approximately 94.1% offered same-day appointments, 91.1% had infrastructure to reduce cost barriers, 90.2% offered after-school appointments, and 80.4% prescribed hormonal contraception without prerequisite examinations or testing. Approximately three quarters provided visual and audio privacy in examination rooms (76.5%) and counseling areas (74.5%). Fewer offered a wide range of contraceptive methods (67.8%) and took a sexual health history at every visit (54.9%). Only 45.1% reported Quick Start initiation of hormonal contraception, emergency contraception (43.1%), or intrauterine devices (12.5%) were ""always"" available to adolescents. Conclusions The assessment highlighted opportunities for health center improvement. Strategies to build capacity of health center partners to implement evidence-based clinical practices may lead to accessibility and quality of reproductive health services for adolescents in the funded communities.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: CODEN: JADHE: Correspondence Address: Romero, L.M.;

Four countries advanced a full stage on the Regulatory Function Framework (RFF), a staged capability maturity model used to evaluate progress in key regulatory functions. While the remaining countries did not advance a full stage on the RFF, important gains were noted. The year-3 evaluation highlighted limitations of the ARC evaluation strategy to capture nuanced progress and provided insight into how the RFF might be adapted for future use. © 2016 .","Export Date: 29 April 2016: Correspondence Address: Dynes, M.;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) effectively uses communities of practice (CoPs) to bring its staff together with partners to share, learn, and address public health problems. This paper aims to focus on CoPs. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The paper assesses the value of CoPs to individual members, their organizations, and their public health domains; assesses whether the CoP Program has improved CDC's relationship with participants in various CoPs; and identifies barriers to participation or success factors that could be applied to the development of new CoPs. Responses from a random sample of active CoP members were analyzed using qualitative data analysis software to identify themes and answer research questions. FINDINGS: The results reveal clear benefits to individual members, their organizations, and public health disciplines including daily work efficiencies, expanded infrastructure, and enhanced relationships between CDC and its public health partners. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This qualitative research analyzed a small number of communities of practice spanning their launch through year 2; further study of a larger sample of public health CoPs, including sustainability factors, would build on this case study's implications. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Public health practitioners seeking a collaborative approach to problem solving will find in this study some useful lessons learned from CDC; readers will be introduced to CDC's CoP Resource Kit and a public health collaboration portal, phConnect. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Well-facilitated, member-driven, and highly participative CoPs are valuable tools for fostering collaboration essential to improving the public health system, and should be used more broadly across public health.",,,,,,,,,,"ABI/INFORM Research; ProQuest Central",,"English","Kempston, United Kingdom, Kempston","10.1108/13673271311315187"

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study analyzed incidents resulting in injuries reported to the US Mine Safety and Health Administration from 2002 to 2011. Incident reports were limited to those occurring at mining plants, shops, yards, and aboveground locations. Incident reports were analyzed to determine which activities contributed to injuries and were due to machine maintenance and repair, non-powered hand tools, and powered hand tools. An in-depth analysis of the root causes of these injuries was then performed. FINDINGS: Maintenance and repair in mining is associated with a significant number of hand and finger injuries with a range of severities and averaging over 20 amputated fingers, 180 fractured hands and fingers, and 455 hand and finger lacerations per year. Many of these injuries are caused by hands being struck by or caught in tools and equipment. Back and shoulder strains are found to be associated with the most days lost from work and are mostly attributed to materials handling. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Occupational injuries and fatalities still occur with high incidences in the mining sector. The mission of the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR; part of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH) is to ""eliminate mining fatalities, injuries, and illnesses through research and prevention."" As part of this work, OMSHR acquires surveillance data from MSHA to quantify the types and sources of injuries at US mining facilities. The authors evaluated maintenance- and repair-related injuries at US mining sites (excluding underground coal mines). Results of this study suggest a need for improved design of machine guarding, improved hand protection through gloves and equipment design/redesign, and manual materials handling solutions. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The findings indicate that maintenance and repair in mining include occupational risks that may be managed through modifications to machines, proper usage of hand tools and hand protection, and improved manual materials handling processes.","Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.: 20141317524835: Design/methodology/approach: Machine maintenance: Manual materials handling: Mine Safety and health Administration: Mine safety and healths: National institute for occupational safety and healths: Occupational health and safety: Underground coal mine",,,"Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",,,,,,,,,"Howard House, Wagon Lane, Bingley, BD16 1WA, United Kingdom","10.1108/JQME-02-2013-0008"

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.

In this study, we used microsatellites to characterize a newly discovered population of f. molestus in Chicago, IL, and compared levels of genetic diversity and differentiation in aboveground and belowground populations from Chicago and New York City, NY. Levels of genetic diversity, as measured by expected heterozygosity and allelic richness, were markedly lower in both f. molestus populations. Allele frequencies were distinctly different between the two f. molestus populations, and some alleles were present in one belowground population and not the other. Pairwise FST values between populations indicated that f. molestus populations were highly divergent from each other, as well as from their associated aboveground populations. Cluster analysis suggested the most likely number of groups was three, with the four f. pipiens populations in one cluster, and each of the f. molestus populations in its own cluster. Admixture analysis detected a low number of hybrids, 8%, between forms. We also tested the efficacy of two assays purported to distinguish between the forms, the CQ11 assay and a restriction fragment-length polymorphism assay of the COI gene, and found neither assay reliable in this regard.

In June 2006, 12 sentinel chicken pens with five chickens per pen were deployed in six types of habitats: herbaceous wetlands, mangrove forests, deciduous forests, evergreen forests, rural areas, and urban areas. Once WNV seroconversion in chickens was detected in June 2007, we began trapping mosquitoes using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) miniature (light/CO2-baited) traps, CMT-20 collapsible mosquito (CO2- and ISCA SkinLure-baited) traps, and CDC gravid (hay infusion-baited) traps. We placed the CDC miniature traps both 2-4 m and >30 m from the chicken pens, the collapsible traps 2-4 m from the pens, and the gravid traps in backyards of houses with sentinel chicken pens and in a wetland adjacent to an urban area. We found numerous blood-engorged mosquitoes in the traps nearest to the sentinel chickens and reasoned that any such mosquitoes with a disseminated WNV infection likely served as vectors for the transmission of WNV to the sentinels. We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and isolation (C636) on pools of heads, thoraxes/abdomens, and legs of collected blood-engorged mosquitoes to determine whether the mosquitoes carried WNV. We detected WNV-disseminated infections in and obtained WNV isolates from Culex nigripalpus Theo (minimum infection rate [MIR] 1.1-9.7/1,000), Culex bahamensis Dyar and Knab (MIR 1.8-6.0/1,000), and Aedes taeniorhynchus (Wied.) (MIR 0.34-0.36/1,000). WNV was also identified in and isolated from the pool of thoraxes and abdomens of Culex quinquefasciatus Say (4.17/1,000) and identified in one pool of thoraxes and abdomens of Culex habilitator Dyar and Knab (13.39/1,000). Accumulated evidence since 2002 suggests that WNV has not become endemic in Puerto Rico.","Author Affiliation: Dengue Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1324 Calle Canada, San Juan 00920, Puerto Rico.: Author Email: rbarrera@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v2iss49_Authors_Barrera.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Lanham",

Three compounds, thymoquinone, nootkatone, and carvacrol, components of Alaska yellow cedar, Chamaecyyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach, and incense cedar, Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.), essential oils, have been shown to have biological activity against a variety of mosquito and tick species. Although these components act as both repellents and insecticides, how they function in either capacity is unknown. Their use as mosquito control insecticides would be greatly increased if their mode of action is not the same as that of currently used commercial products. This study compared the lethal dosages for nootkatone, carvacrol, and thymoquinone by using colony strains of Anopheles gambiae Giles with known mutations at three different target sites. The altered target sites evaluated were the sodium channel para-locus mutation (L1014 F KDR) that confers permethrin resistance, the ACE-1 gene that confers organophosphate and carbamate resistance, and a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor mutation of the Rdl locus conferring dieldrin resistance. Significant increases in lethal dose were not observed in any of the mosquito strains for any of the compounds tested compared with the doses required of chemicals with known modes of action at the mutated sites. Although the mode of action was not determined, this screening study indicates that none of these compounds interact at the target sites represented in the test mosquito strains. These compounds represent a different mode of action than existing chemicals currently used in mosquito control.","Author Affiliation: Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 3150 Rampart Road, Fort Collins, CO 80521, USA.: Author Email: jvm6@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v2iss49_Authors_McAllister.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Lanham",

WNV-positive stable flies were observed feeding en masse on incapacitated, WNV-positive pelicans, arousing suspicions that the flies could have been involved in WNV transmission among pelicans, and perhaps to livestock and humans. We assessed biological transmission by infecting stable flies intrathoracically with WNV and testing them at 2-d intervals over 20 d. Infectious WNV was detected in fly bodies in decreasing amounts over time for only the first 6 d postinfection, an indication that WNV did not replicate within fly tissues and that stable flies cannot biologically transmit WNV. We assessed mechanical transmission using a novel technique. Specifically, we fed WNV-infected blood to individual flies by using a cotton swab (i.e., artificial donor), and at intervals of 1 min-24 h, we allowed flies to refeed on a different swab saturated with WNV-negative blood (i.e., artificial recipient). Flies mechanically transmitted viable WNV from donor to recipient swabs for up to 6 h postinfection, with the majority of the transmission events occurring within the first hour. Flies mechanically transmitted WNV RNA to recipient swabs for up to 24 h, mostly within the first 6 h. Given its predilection to feed multiple times when disturbed, these findings support the possibility that the stable fly could mechanically transmit WNV.","Author Affiliation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Arboviral Diseases Branch, 3150 Rampart Rd., Fort Collins, CO 80521, USA.: Author Email: mdoyle@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v3iss22_Authors_Doyle.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Lanham","10.1603/me10167"

Transmission efficiency by adult females was similarly high among infection groups and ranged from 58% for type B to 89% for A2 infections.

It has now been three decades since the etiological agent of the disease in North America, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and its primary North American vectors, the ticks Ixodes scapularis Say and I. pacificus Cooley & Kohls, were identified. Great strides have been made in our understanding of the ecology of the vectors and disease agent, and this knowledge has been used to design a wide range of prevention and control strategies. However, despite these advances, the number of Lyme disease cases have steadily increased. In this article, we assess potential reasons for the continued lack of success in prevention and control of Lyme disease in the northeastern United States, and identify conceptual areas where additional knowledge could be used to improve Lyme disease prevention and control strategies. Some of these areas include: (1) identifying critical host infestation rates required to maintain enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi, (2) understanding how habitat diversity and forest fragmentation impacts acarological risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi and the ability of interventions to reduce risk, (3) quantifying the epidemiological outcomes of interventions focusing on ticks or vertebrate reservoirs, and (4) refining knowledge of how human behavior influences Lyme disease risk and identifying barriers to the adoption of personal protective measures and environmental tick management.","Author Affiliation: Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 3150 Rampart Road, Fort Collins, CO 80522, USA.: Author Email: dyn2@cdc.gov",,"http://intranet.cdc.gov/phlic/digitalrepository/ScienceClips/v4iss4_Authors_Eisen_Piesman.pdf",,,,,,,"CABDirect2",,"English","Lanham","10.1603/me11138"

The purpose of this study was to obtain an in-depth understanding of the RC business model pertaining to vaccine offerings, profitability, and decision making. From March to June 2009, we conducted 15 interviews with key individuals from three types of organizations: 12 representatives of RC corporations, 2 representatives of retail hosts (i.e., stores in which the RCs are located), and 1 representative of an industry association. We analyzed interview transcripts qualitatively. Our results indicate that consumer demand and profitability were the main drivers in offering vaccinations. RCs in this sample primarily offered vaccinations to adults and adolescents, and they were not well integrated with local public health and immunization registries. Our findings demonstrate the potential for stronger linkages with public health in these settings. The findings also may help inform future research to increase patient access to vaccination services at RCs.","Export Date: 8 December 2015: CODEN: JHMAF: Chemicals/CAS: Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, 126161-67-9: References: Ahmed Fincham, A.J.E., Patients’ view of retail clinics as a source of primary care: Boon for nurse practitioners?

These approaches are presented in an analytic framework that distinguishes between national and community-based multilevel programs, prevention, and treatment/maintenance. The primary source of evidence are six reviews of reviews published since 2005, supplemented by a small number of systematic reviews and primary studies. We report strongly supportive evidence concerning the effectiveness of structural interventions (restrictions on access to bridges, tall buildings, and railways) and restriction on access to pharmacological agents. Weakly supportive evidence of effectiveness is available for community-based multilevel programs; restrictions on access to firearms and ligature points in institutional settings; settings-based programs (in schools, communities, workplaces, prisons, and the armed forces); education and training targeted at primary care physicians; lithium; cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy; and brief contact. There is insufficient or conflicting evidence concerning the effectiveness of the remaining approaches. We conclude that the evidence base for effective suicide prevention is far from convincing. Major improvement in the extent and quality of collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners and a considerable increase in funding for evaluation studies in suicide prevention are required if the current knowledge gap about effective interventions is to be bridged.",,,"https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000671","Platt, Stephen: Usher Institute, Old Medical School, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, EH8 9AG, steve.platt@ed.ac.uk",,,,,,,,,,"10.1027/0227-5910/a000671"

The paper emphasizes the BYM formulation, how it is applied in terms of ROP modeling, identifies the main drilling parameters driving each subfunction, and introduces how they were developed; the paper is also addressing the normalization factors and modeling coefficients which have significant influence on the model. The present work details three simulations aiming to understand the approach by applying the formulation in a presalt layer and how some modification of the main method may impact the modeling of the fitting process. The simulation runs show that the relative error measures can be seen as the most reliable fitting verification on top of R-squared. Applying normalization factors and by allowing a more wide range of applicable drillability coefficients, the regression could allow better fitting of the simulation to real data from 54% to 73%, which is an improvement of about 20%. © 2015 Andreas Nascimento et al.","Export Date: 13 November 2015: Correspondence Address: Nascimento, A.; Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Faculdade de Engenharia, Câmpus de Guaratinguetá (FEG), Departamento de Mecânica (DME)/PRH48-ANP, Avenida Ariberto Pereira da Cunha 333, Portal das Colinas, Brazil: References: Cunningham, R.A., (1960) Laboratory Studies of the Effect of Rotary Speed on Rock-bit Performance and Drilling Cost, , American Petroleum Institute; Maurer, W.C., The 'Perfect-cleaning' theory of rotary drilling (1962) Journal of Petroleum Technology, 14 (11); Galle, E.M., Woods, H.B., (1964) Best Constant Weight and Rotary Speed for Rotary Rock Bits, , American Petroleum Institute; Bourgoyne, A.T., Jr., Young, F.S., Jr., A multiple regression approach to optimal drilling and abnormal pressure detection (1974) Society of PetroleumEngineers Journal, 14 (4), pp. 371-384; Bingham, M.G., (1965) A New Approach to Interpreting Rock Drillability, , Petroleum Publishing Company; Warren, T.M., Drilling model for soft-formation bits (1981) Journal of Petroleum Technology, 33 (6); Bourgoyne, A.T., Jr., (1986) Applied Drilling Engineering Handbook, 2. , Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), Richardson, Tex, USA; Carminatti, M., Wolff, B., Gamboa, L., New exploratory frontiers in Brazil (2008) Proceedings of the 19th World Petroleum Congress (WPC '08), , Madrid, Spain, June-July, WPC-19-2802; Mello, M.R., Bender, A.A., Filho, N.C.A., DeMio, E., Giant sub-salt hydrocarbon province of the greater campos Basin, Brazil (2011) Proceedings of the Offshore Technology Conference OTC Brasil, , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, October; Johann, P.R., Martini, A.F., Maul, A., Nunes, J.P.P., Reservoir geophysics in Brazilian pre-salt oilfields (2012) Proceedings of the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC '12), , OTC-23681-MS, Houston, Tex, USA, April; Eren, T., (2015) Real-time-optimization of Drilling Parameters during Drilling Operations, , [Ph.

Many men do not seek help if they have mental health problems and suicides may occur in reaction to stressful circumstances. Aims: We examined the precipitating circumstances of 600 suicides without known mental health or substance abuse (MH/SA) problems and with a recent crisis. Whether these suicides occurred within the context of an acute crisis only or in the context of chronic circumstances was observed. Method: Using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System and employing mixed-methods analysis, we examined the circumstances and context of a census of middle-aged male suicides (n = 600) in seven states between 2005 and 2010. Results: Precipitating circumstances among this group involved intimate partner problems (IPP; 58.3%), criminal/legal problems (50.7%), job/financial problems (22.5%), and health problems (13.5%). Men with IPP and criminal/legal issues were more likely than men with health and/or job/financial issues to experience suicide in the context of an acute crisis only. Conclusion: Suicides occurring in reaction to an acute crisis only or in the context of acute and chronic circumstances lend themselves to opportunities for intervention.
