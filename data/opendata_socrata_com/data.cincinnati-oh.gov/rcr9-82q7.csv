"story","Private Lot Abatement Program (PLAP)","The Private Lot Abatement Program (PLAP) was formed through a proposal by Mayor Cranley to clean up overgrown lots and blight on private property in Cincinnati neighborhoods.

PURPOSE: To promote thriving, clean, safe, and healthy neighborhoods through cleaning and abatement of private lots, while increasing code enforcement and civil citation revenue (for reinvestment back into PLAP).

HOW IT WORKS: Overgrown and blighted properties are reported by phone, the FixIt Cincy App, or online: code enforcement inspectors go out to physically inspect these properties. Citations are issued for tall grass and weeds (when overgrowth exceeds 10"" height) and litter on the property: if the property is still in violation 10 days later, a second citation is issued, and the property is considered ""abandoned,"" and is included in PLAP for abatement and ongoing maintenance. 

Properties with multiple abatements are candidates for sale or legal lot re-purposing via the Land Bank.

Both code enforcement and property abatement work is managed by the Neighborhood Operations Division (NOD) of the Department of Public Services (DPS).","15052","2016-11-08T00:00:00.000","0","published","official","55ef-pfz7","https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/55ef-pfz7","2022-02-23T00:00:00.000","Office of Performance & Data Analytics","public","approved","insights.cincinnati-oh.gov","No","wvxi-y5xi"

The Cincinnati Residential Tax Abatement program minimizes property owners' taxes by allowing them to pay taxes on the pre-improvement value of their property for 10-15 years. Property tax abatement is available for any increased valuation that results from improvements to the property for new construction and renovation. The goals of this program are: 1) stimulate community revitalization, 2) retain City residents, 3) attract homeowners, and 4) reduce development costs of home-ownership and rental projects. 

All condominiums and one-, two-, or three-unit structures within the City of Cincinnati—new construction or rehab—may apply for the residential tax abatement program. A minimum of $2,500 for one- and two-unit structures and $5,000 for three-unit structures must have been spent on eligible activities. 

The Hamilton County Auditor's Office determines the abatement amount based on the type of improvements as well as what affected tax bill it is applied.

"story","Emissions & Greenhouse Gases","The City of Cincinnati recognizes that climate plays an important role in the quality of life, economic well-being, and long term sustainability of our City and region.  Greenhouse gases (GHG) like Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide as the result of human activity are collecting in the Earth’s atmosphere at levels that are capable of altering our climate. The Green Cincinnati Plan outlines steps we can take to mitigate our region’s environmental impact and one of those steps is a greenhouse gas inventory. Cincinnati’s first GHG inventory was conducted in 2006, and serves as the baseline from which our climate impact is measured.  

This summary of Cincinnati's 2015 Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Analysis shows that our efforts, combined with changes in the region’s energy supply, have been effective in reducing our emissions output.  With this information the City of Cincinnati can measure our progress on our path to sustainability and provides data to inform policy and decision making.

The Government emissions inventory includes emissions generated from municipal operations, including energy used in water and waste water treatment, city building and facilities operations, streetlights, traffic signals, vehicle fleet and aviation fuel use.
Reductions can be attributed to: Street light conversion to LED lightbulbs; Facility energy improvement upgrades/retrofits; Upgrades to Metropolitan Sewer District's incinerators; and Installation of solar panels on some City owned facilities.

The Community emissions inventory includes emissions generated from commercial, industrial, and residential gas and electric consumption, motor vehicle transportation, and solid waste generation. Reductions can be attributed to:Incentives for commercial energy upgrades offered by Duke; Grid decarbonization;100% Renewable energy offered to residents and businesses through the City's Energy Aggregation Program; Population loss from 2006 to 2015 (approximately 10%); and Improved waste diversion.

Taken together, Government and Community emissions total approximately 7.6M tons CO2e, representing a citywide reduction of 18.4% since the 2006 baseline was established at 9.3M tons CO2e. The largest increases in emissions occurred in the industrial energy and vehicular travel sector, while the largest reductions were seen in the commercial and residential energy sectors. 

From 2006 to 20015, Cincinnati achieved a city-wide 18.4% reduction in GHG emissions. Based on targets originally established in the 2008 Green Cincinnati Plan, this decrease indicates that the city has met its goal of a 2% reduction in GHG emissions per year. 
The City of Cincinnati will continue to work to reduce the region’s emissions through the implementation of recommendations of the Green Cincinnati Plan.","7734","2017-02-08T00:00:00.000","0","published","official","d49x-hx36","https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/d49x-hx36","2020-07-28T00:00:00.000","Office of Performance & Data Analytics","public","approved","insights.cincinnati-oh.gov","No","wvxi-y5xi"
