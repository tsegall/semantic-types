In October 2016, GCWW was directed by the City of Cincinnati Council, via Ordinance No. 326-2016, to take the appropriate steps to develop, fund, and implement a program to replace known lead service lines in the City, both on public and private property. Through another ordinance, Ordinance No. 185-2017, and effective July 28, 2017, lead service lines are prohibited in the GCWW system. Enforcement of this ban is being phased in over time.

The private-side work is then done by contractors or plumbers who are contracted with GCWW through the City's procurement process, either for a water main replacement project, or from a pre-qualified list established through the City's Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process. This dataset is the list of jobs from the pre-qualified list of plumbers established through the RFQ process.

They are used by mobile operators to extend service coverage and/or increase network capacity, and are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Small cells are typically radio equipment and antennae, and are placed on structures in high-density areas.

While small cells can be installed in both private and public spaces, this data set only includes permits for small cell installation in the public right-of-way. These permits are regulated by the City's department of Transportation & Engineering (DOTE). In this case, ""right-of-way"" means that a ""wireless support structure"" in the right of way. This could include city-owned poles/structures; third party-owned poles/structures; or any other structure that can be modified to support small cell installation, such as a bus shelter or certain types of street sights. In this case, right-of-way refers to the location of the antenna and supporting equipment.

The purpose of small cell permits in the right of way is for the provision of wireless service to the public. The City of Cincinnati has structured the small cell permitting process to supporting early and efficient roll-out of emerging wireless technologies, while simultaneously preserving local design guidelines and respecting the character of Cincinnati neighborhoods.

"dataset","City of Cincinnati, Ohio Resident Survey","The Cincinnati Community Perceptions Survey was developed by the City's Office of Performance and Data Analytics and ETC Institute in the fall of 2021. This community engagement tool was designed to allow the City Administration to evaluate resident satisfaction with our services and measure that level of satisfaction against cities of similar size, location, and demographics. The survey design also allows the City to capture community priorities for investment in services over the next two years.

The survey was administered during the winter of 2021 by mail to a random sample of households across the city, and was available to complete by mail or online. The goal of 1,200 completed surveys was exceeded, with a total of 1,408 residents completing the survey. The overall residents for the sample of 1,408 households have a precision of at least +/-2.6% at the 95% level of confidence, and are demographically representative of our city's population.

This year's survey will set a baseline for Cincinnati to work from with the goal of better understanding where we are excelling in service delivery and where our local government could benefit from intentional improvement and resources.

The call data does not contain the nature of the emergency or dispatched resources. For dispatch data reference Police Calls for Service (CAD) or Cincinnati Fire Incidents (CAD).

Data Creation: This dataset includes both emergency (911) and administrative calls to the center.  To obtain just emergency (911) calls filter for Call Type = 911.

Data Created By: The source of this data is the City of Cincinnati's Call System that was provided by Cincinnati Bell.

Refresh Frequency: This dataset contains calls from January 1, 2013 through December 14, 2017. On December 14, 2017 the Emergency Call Center transferred to a new phone system and the remainder of 2017 was captured in that system. Additionally, for a portion of 2014, around May, operations were temporarily transferred to the back-up location and call records were not captured.

Data Dictionary: A data dictionary providing definitions of columns and attributes is available as an attachment to this dataset.

Processing: The City of Cincinnati is committed to providing the most granular and accurate data possible. In that pursuit the Office of Performance and Data Analytics facilitates standard processing to most raw data prior to publication. Processing includes but is not limited: address verification, geocoding, decoding attributes, and addition of administrative areas (i.e. Census, neighborhoods, police districts, etc.).
