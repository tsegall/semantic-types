Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

For example, the national Current Employment Statistics (CES) program publishes data for most of the 1,083 NAICS detailed industries for the nation. QCEW publishes every NAICS industry for the more than 3,000 counties in the United States. The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by State unemployment insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. Publicly available files include data on the number of establishments, monthly employment, and quarterly wages, by NAICS industry, by county, by ownership sector, for the entire United States. These data are aggregated to annual levels, to higher industry levels (NAICS industry groups, sectors, and supersectors), and to higher geographic levels (national, State, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)). Employment data under the QCEW program represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period including the 12th of the month. Excluded are members of the armed forces, the self-employed, proprietors, domestic workers, unpaid family workers, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Wages represent total compensation paid during the calendar quarter, regardless of when services were performed.

A good condition rating means there is a remaining service life of 11 or more years; a fair rating indicates a remaining service life of six through 10 years; and, a poor evaluation represents a remaining service life of less than six years. CDOT’s surface treatment program is generally able to achieve the target established by the Transportation Commission at the beginning of each year. The annual target continues to be established each year at a level lower than the prior year’s actual level, which is indicative of the continued system deterioration caused by insufficient investment in surface treatment. Pavement maintenance is generally provided from discretionary CDOT funds.

Added in February 2019, the Colorado Trail System, now titled the Colorado Trail Explorer (COTREX), endeavors to map every trail in the state of Colorado. Currently there are nearly 40,000 miles of trails mapped. Trails come from a variety of sources (USFS, BLM, local parks & recreation departments, local governments) and are compiled by CPW contractor Natural Atlas. Responsibility for accuracy of the data rests with the source.

CPW Trail Segments
Recognizing that an all-inclusive, spatially-aware model of trails Colorado State Park is a useful management tool and a valuable public resource this geodatabase is designed to accomplish three objectives.
1. Inventorying all designated trails Colorado Parks & Wildlife maintain in Colorado State associate each trail segment with 38 applicable attributes. (length, width, surface, difficulty, etc.)

2. Determine and track if the following 11 uses are permitted on each trail segment: 1:Hiking, 2:Biking, 3: Equestrian 4:Pets, 5:Snowshoeing. 6: Cross Country Skiing, 7: Snowmobiling, 8: Grooming, 9: OHV 10: Other Power Driven Mobility Devices (OPDMD), 11:Wheelchair friendliness (Not ADA accessibility)

3. Model Colorado State Park Trail system in a spatially aware three dimensional space and associate each trail segment to 38 attributes that can be used to producing a set of standardized trail maps for public and internal use.","652","2019-02-22T18:03:00.000Z","2019-02-22T18:03:00.000Z","Recreation","colorado,colorado state agency gis data,trails,parks,state parks,cotrex,trailheads,covid19","0","OIT - GIS Coordination and Development Program","seth.mcclean@state.co.us",,"published",,,,"Colorado Parks and Wildlife",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tsn8-y22x.json",,"https://cpw.state.co.us",,,,,,,,,,,"The Colorado State Trails Program (a division of COLORADO PARKS & WILDLIFE)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://cpw.state.co.us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"xxxj-hmi8","official",,,,,,,,,

Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

The 1/3 arc-second NED contains resampled data from the 1/9 arc-second layer of NED. Secondary input datasets include the high resolution flow lines, water bodies, and areas from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD layers are used to hydro-enforce the DEM prior to contour generation. The goals of the hydro-enforcement are to prevent contour lines from extending over the surface of water bodies, to align the contour reentrants with the NHD single-line streams, and to cross NHD rivers appropriately. These contour data are the result of scientific research aimed at developing nationwide contour data that are consistent, repeatable, fully automatic, GIS-ready, and follow cartographic rules.

Business location is geocoded and is referenced in the location field using the Principal Address information, however location is not guaranteed to be physical location of business in every case. As of January 2015 there are over 1.3 million unique business id's registered with the state of co, and there is a (very rough) average of 2,000 new businesses added each week. Entity and Entity Id are the business number from SOS (also the unique identifier), and registered business name. Principal Address (used to generate the geocoded column: Location), however it is not always guaranteed to be the physical location of the business entity’s main operation.  Some business can be registered in CO but have an address outside of the state, may list a po box, there are businesses with locations that don’t have a public access entry point). Mailing Address is the mailing address of the business owner, and the Agent address may be the address of the agent or in some cases has the same address as the business owner.

CGS staff geologist Jonathan L. White and field assistants James Hodge and Michael J. Zawaski completed the field work on this project at the end of the summer of 2010. Jon White, the principal mapper and author, created this report using field maps, photographs, structural measurements, and field notes generated by all the investigators. Significant knowledge was also gained by a compilation of the available published geologic literature listed in the references. This map was improved from reviews by Larry Moyer (consulting petroleum geologist), David Noe (Colorado Geological Survey), as well as pertinent edits of the adjacent Meeker quadrangle by Rex Cole (Colorado Mesa University). This mapping project was funded jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the CGS. USGS funding comes from the STATEMAP component of the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, award number G10AC00410, authorized by the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1997, reauthorized in 2009. CGS matching funding comes from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Severance Tax Operational Funds, from severance taxes paid on the production of natural gas, oil, coal, and metals in Colorado.

''Community Anchor Institutions'' consist of schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community colleges and other institutions of higher education, and other community support organizations and entities. These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions which have broadband access are located; this can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching connectivity goals. Although it is constantly being improved upon, ultimately we aim for this data set to evolve into a reliable resource for emergency response services.

The dataset includes indicators on adult asthma prevalence, cigarette smoking prevalence, coronary heart disease prevalence, percent of adults who delayed medical care due to cost, diabetes prevalence, binge drinking and heavy alcohol consumption, percent of adults with fair or poor health status, mental distress, percent of adults with no routine medical checkup in the past 12 month, obesity and overweight prevalence, percent of adults that did not report doing physical activity or exercise, and percent of adults with frequent physical distress.  These four-year estimates (2013-2016) have been produced for each census tract in the State of Colorado based on modeled survey data collected in the Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and incorporating population, race, gender, and age estimates for each census tract from the American Community Survey.  CDPHE's Community Level Estimates are output from statistical models used to generate health condition and risk behavior estimates for smaller geographies than traditional surveillance systems report. The estimates are produced using a multilevel model that incorporates individual Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey responses in addition to socio-demographic and contextual information about each census tract from the U.S. Census (American Community Survey). The individual survey responses related to a health condition or risk behavior from the Colorado BRFSS are nested within geographic boundaries (counties) where both individual characteristics (demographic) as well as sociodemographic characteristics can be used to model the probability of having a health condition or risk behavior at the census tract geography.","147","2017-04-01T00:28:00.000Z","2017-04-01T00:28:00.000Z",,"cdphe,colorado,gis,health,risk behavior,community level estimates,gocodecolorado,covid19","0","CDPHE_spatial_data","devon.williford@state.co.us",,"published",,,,"Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment",,,,,,,,,,,"The estimates provided in the data tables and maps within this application are for informational purposes and there are no restrictions for using or disseminating this data set.
