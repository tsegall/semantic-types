"6290","Biofuels Research Grants","The Colorado Office of Economic Development administers the
Bioscience Discovery Evaluation Grant Program (Program), which
provides grants to research institutions for biofuels research
projects. Biofuels research is defined as the use of
microorganisms, specialized proteins, or thermal processes to
develop biofuels and the related processes that make traditional
manufacturing of energy cleaner and more efficient. Biofuel is
defined as a biologically based fuel product developed from plant
matter or other biological material, including renewable
agricultural sources. Grant limits, matching funds, and other
eligibility requirements apply. Any unexpended money in the fund
as of January 1, 2015, will be transferred to the Advanced
Industries Acceleration Cash Fund. For more information, please

its primary propulsion method, has at least three wheels in
contact with the ground, does not use handlebars to steer,
displays a vehicle identification number, and meets manufacturer
requirements as defined in Title 49 of the Code of Federal
Regulations ( http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR ), section 565. A low-speed EV may be operated on a roadway with
a speed limit of up to 40 miles per hour (mph) as long as the
roadway's lane is at least 11 feet wide, the roadway provides two
or more lanes in either direction, and the Colorado Department of
Transportation has determined that operation of a low-speed EV on
the roadway poses no substantial safety risk. Otherwise, a
low-speed EV may only be operated on a roadway with a speed limit
of 35 miles per hour (mph) or less. Regardless, a low-speed EV
may directly cross any roadway with a speed limit greater than 35
mph. Low-speed EVs may not be sold or offered for sale unless
they comply with state vehicle safety requirements.

A Class-B low-speed EV is defined as a low-speed EV that is
capable of traveling at greater than 25 mph but less than 45 mph.
A Class-B low-speed EV may be operated only on a roadway with a
speed limit of 45 mph or less, but may directly cross a roadway

"5619","State Agency Alternative Fuel Use and Vehicle Acquisition Requirement","The Colorado Department of Personnel and Administration (DPA)
requires all state-owned diesel vehicles and equipment to be
fueled with a fuel blend of 20% biodiesel (B20), subject to the
availability of the fuel and so long as the price differential is
not greater than $0.10 more per gallon as compared to
conventional diesel. Biodiesel is defined as fuel composed of
mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from plant or
animal matter that meets ASTM specifications and is produced in
Colorado.

Additionally, DPA has adopted a policy to increase the use of
alternative fuels and establish objectives to increase its use
for each succeeding year. DPA must purchase motor vehicles that
operate on compressed natural gas (CNG), plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles, or vehicles that operate on other alternative fuels,
subject to the availability of vehicles and adequate fueling
infrastructure and assuming the incremental base or life cycle
cost of the vehicle is not more than 10% over the cost of a
comparable dedicated conventional vehicle. DPA may adopt a policy
to allow some vehicles to be exempt from this requirement.

Beginning in 2013, on or before November 1 of each year, DPA must
submit a report to the general assembly outlining vehicle
purchases, including alternative fuel and conventional vehicles;
alternative fueling infrastructure availability in the state;
alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchase exemptions;
administrative policies in place to facilitate the purchase of
AFVs; suggested changes to facilitate the gradual conversion of
the motor vehicle fleet to AFVs; and a plan for the necessary
infrastructure development.

In addition, each state agency must develop a plan to improve
commuting options for its employees. The plans should evaluate
opportunities including plug-in electric vehicle charging.

Vehicle Credit for a vehicle titled and registered in Colorado
that uses or is converted to use an alternative fuel, is a hybrid
electric vehicle (HEV), is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
(PHEV), or has its power source replaced with one that uses an
alternative fuel. Electric vehicles (EVs) and PHEVs must have a
maximum speed of at least 55 miles per hour. Qualified idle
reduction technologies are also eligible for the tax credit.
Credits for vehicles purchased or converted January 1, 2012,
through December 31, 2021, are based on defined vehicle and
technology categories as listed below. Credit amounts vary for
each category and tax year with percentages applying to
incremental cost for alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchases and

Credits for EVs and PHEVs in Category 1 are equal to the actual
cost incurred to purchase or lease the vehicle, multiplied by the
battery capacity, and divided by 100. That amount must be
multiplied by a factor to determine the credit amount, as
follows: 1.0 for 2013-2018, 0.75 for 2019, 0.50 for 2020, and
0.25 for 2021.

The credit is capped at $6,000 for the following: OEM or
converted AFVs, HEVs, PHEVs, idle reduction technologies, and
power source replacements. The credit for PHEV conversions is
capped at $7,500 until January 1, 2014, and $6,000 thereafter. A
person who claimed a tax credit in previous years for the
purchase or lease of Model Year 2004 and newer HEV may claim an
additional credit for the conversion of the same vehicle to a
PHEV. The purchase of a used vehicle may qualify if the vehicle
was not previously registered in Colorado. Credits may not be
carried forward and a taxpayer will receive a refund for the
excess credit.

Credits for CNG, electric, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
purchased, leased, or converted during the 2013 tax year may be
determined in one of two different ways. For more information,
