Years ago, outdoor knowledge was passed from generation to generation. It provided for the development of an environmental ethic and the foundation for living a healthy lifestyle - mentally and physically. For numerous reasons this knowledge is no longer being passed to our youth. Yet, experts from the American Academy of Pediatrics have drawn a direct link from lack of time outdoors to youth obesity, attention disorders, depression, and academic performance. All agree: children need exposure to nature the same way they need good nutrition and adequate sleep. The good news - the solution is right outside. Wildland Awareness and Educational Institute follows the latest research and is a source of new programs and strategies that engage individuals of all ages in the outdoors and fosters healthy lifestyles.","f","f","f","t","t","f","f"
