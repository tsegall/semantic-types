The Colorado Low Head Dams inventory includes location information for engineered structures in main stem rivers and their major tributaries. Since the inventory does not include structures on all rivers, it should not be considered an all-inclusive list of all the hazardous structures that may exist.
Structures within the inventory are categorized according to physical attributes and purpose. The three categories are: Diversion structures, grade control structures and recreational structures.

CDOT’s surface treatment program is generally able to achieve the target established by the Transportation Commission at the beginning of each year. The annual target continues to be established each year at a level lower than the prior year’s actual level, which is indicative of the continued system deterioration caused by insufficient investment in surface treatment.

Added in February 2019, the Colorado Trail System, now titled the Colorado Trail Explorer (COTREX), endeavors to map every trail in the state of Colorado. Currently there are nearly 40,000 miles of trails mapped. Trails come from a variety of sources (USFS, BLM, local parks & recreation departments, local governments) and are compiled by CPW contractor Natural Atlas. Responsibility for accuracy of the data rests with the source.

CPW Trail Segments
Recognizing that an all-inclusive, spatially-aware model of trails Colorado State Park is a useful management tool and a valuable public resource this geodatabase is designed to accomplish three objectives.
1. Inventorying all designated trails Colorado Parks & Wildlife maintain in Colorado State associate each trail segment with 38 applicable attributes. (length, width, surface, difficulty, etc.)

2. Determine and track if the following 11 uses are permitted on each trail segment: 1:Hiking, 2:Biking, 3: Equestrian 4:Pets, 5:Snowshoeing. 6: Cross Country Skiing, 7: Snowmobiling, 8: Grooming, 9: OHV 10: Other Power Driven Mobility Devices (OPDMD), 11:Wheelchair friendliness (Not ADA accessibility)

3. Model Colorado State Park Trail system in a spatially aware three dimensional space and associate each trail segment to 38 attributes that can be used to producing a set of standardized trail maps for public and internal use.","652","2019-02-22T18:03:00.000Z","2019-02-22T18:03:00.000Z","Recreation","colorado,colorado state agency gis data,trails,parks,state parks,cotrex,trailheads,covid19","0","OIT - GIS Coordination and Development Program","seth.mcclean@state.co.us",,"published",,,,"Colorado Parks and Wildlife",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tsn8-y22x.json",,"https://cpw.state.co.us",,,,,,,,,,,"The Colorado State Trails Program (a division of COLORADO PARKS & WILDLIFE)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://cpw.state.co.us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area.

The 1/3 arc-second NED contains resampled data from the 1/9 arc-second layer of NED. Secondary input datasets include the high resolution flow lines, water bodies, and areas from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD layers are used to hydro-enforce the DEM prior to contour generation. The goals of the hydro-enforcement are to prevent contour lines from extending over the surface of water bodies, to align the contour reentrants with the NHD single-line streams, and to cross NHD rivers appropriately. These contour data are the result of scientific research aimed at developing nationwide contour data that are consistent, repeatable, fully automatic, GIS-ready, and follow cartographic rules.

CGS staff geologist Jonathan L. White and field assistants James Hodge and Michael J. Zawaski completed the field work on this project at the end of the summer of 2010. Jon White, the principal mapper and author, created this report using field maps, photographs, structural measurements, and field notes generated by all the investigators. Significant knowledge was also gained by a compilation of the available published geologic literature listed in the references. This map was improved from reviews by Larry Moyer (consulting petroleum geologist), David Noe (Colorado Geological Survey), as well as pertinent edits of the adjacent Meeker quadrangle by Rex Cole (Colorado Mesa University). This mapping project was funded jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the CGS. USGS funding comes from the STATEMAP component of the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, award number G10AC00410, authorized by the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1997, reauthorized in 2009. CGS matching funding comes from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Severance Tax Operational Funds, from severance taxes paid on the production of natural gas, oil, coal, and metals in Colorado.

''Community Anchor Institutions'' consist of schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community colleges and other institutions of higher education, and other community support organizations and entities. These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions which have broadband access are located; this can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching connectivity goals. Although it is constantly being improved upon, ultimately we aim for this data set to evolve into a reliable resource for emergency response services.

The dataset includes indicators on adult asthma prevalence, cigarette smoking prevalence, coronary heart disease prevalence, percent of adults who delayed medical care due to cost, diabetes prevalence, binge drinking and heavy alcohol consumption, percent of adults with fair or poor health status, mental distress, percent of adults with no routine medical checkup in the past 12 month, obesity and overweight prevalence, percent of adults that did not report doing physical activity or exercise, and percent of adults with frequent physical distress.  These four-year estimates (2013-2016) have been produced for each census tract in the State of Colorado based on modeled survey data collected in the Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and incorporating population, race, gender, and age estimates for each census tract from the American Community Survey.  CDPHE's Community Level Estimates are output from statistical models used to generate health condition and risk behavior estimates for smaller geographies than traditional surveillance systems report. The estimates are produced using a multilevel model that incorporates individual Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey responses in addition to socio-demographic and contextual information about each census tract from the U.S. Census (American Community Survey). The individual survey responses related to a health condition or risk behavior from the Colorado BRFSS are nested within geographic boundaries (counties) where both individual characteristics (demographic) as well as sociodemographic characteristics can be used to model the probability of having a health condition or risk behavior at the census tract geography.","147","2017-04-01T00:28:00.000Z","2017-04-01T00:28:00.000Z",,"cdphe,colorado,gis,health,risk behavior,community level estimates,gocodecolorado,covid19","0","CDPHE_spatial_data","devon.williford@state.co.us",,"published",,,,"Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment",,,,,,,,,,,"The estimates provided in the data tables and maps within this application are for informational purposes and there are no restrictions for using or disseminating this data set.

CDOT’s surface treatment program is generally able to achieve the target established by the Transportation Commission at the beginning of each year. The annual target continues to be established each year at a level lower than the prior year’s actual level, which is indicative of the continued system deterioration caused by insufficient investment in surface treatment.

With support from the State, 11 master plans were developed with the understanding that watershed recovery and resilience requires a holistic approach from the top of the watershed to the bottom, and also requires the engagement and participation of a broad range of watershed stakeholders, including local and state government, non-profits, businesses and landowners. The master planning process provided a collaborative approach to identify and prioritize needs, to develop projects and to guide the implementation. The master planning process also catalyzed the formation of watershed coalitions which are now actively guiding restoration and resiliency efforts within the flood impacted watersheds.","111","2016-11-22T15:37:00.000Z","2016-11-22T15:37:00.000Z","Water","watershed,coalition,resiliency,resilient,boundaries,flood,colorado","50","OIT - GIS Coordination and Development Program","windy.fischer@state.co.us",,"published",,,,"Muller Engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://data.colorado.gov/resource/yk4s-me3x.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The State of Colorado created a first-of-its-kind watershed restoration program utilizing funding from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

These grant funds build coalition capacity, bringing together the diverse range of stakeholders required to restore disaster-impacted watersheds. River restoration projects in this program not only restore natural systems, but achieve multiple benefits, such as increasing community connectivity by tying into trail systems, promoting safety by protecting infrastructure, enhancing local economy by incorporating recreational opportunities and building resiliency for communities and ecosystems.

This is a core part of our approach for Customer- and Taxpayer-Focused Performance Management.","41","2016-11-16T18:19:00.000Z","2016-11-16T18:19:00.000Z","State","personnel and administration,department of personnel and administration,performance plan","0","April Broome","","Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)","published",,,,"Governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://data.colorado.gov/resource/925r-8zqc.json",,"https://sites.google.com/a/state.co.us/colorado-performance-management/department-performance-plans",,,,,,,,,,,"Governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://sites.google.com/a/state.co.us/colorado-performance-management/department-performance-plans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The annual lobbyist registration identification number is updated when they register in a current fiscal year, and the first four numbers reflect status of the lobbyist when registering in a current fiscal year (for example, if they were registered in 2015, but did not update their registration in 2016, then the registration id would remain 2015 until they register in a new fiscal year). The data is updated as necessary to the main lobbyist online system via manual entry, however the updates to the Colorado Information Marketplace is only done weekly, every Monday night. Data goes back to 1995, but in 2002 a mandate established that the secretary of state transition to an online system. Then in 2010 Senate Bill 10-87, among other major changes, shifted the lobbyist registration and disclosure periods to the state fiscal year rather than the calendar year. Multiple bills are associated with a single monetary transaction (gross income) for a given month from a client to a lobbyist, and they are listed in the billInformationAndPosition field along with the position of the client. In a reporting month, income is reported based on the date that it is actually received. For example, in the event that a payment is made cumulatively over a three month period, they must report the full three month payment, and associated bills, when the payment was received. If a lobbyist has multiple payments received by various clients, each dollar amount is reported separately by each client. The statute specifies that lobbyists report the total amount they receive from the client. This is how the data is collected, and based on this database structure individual amounts associated with individual bills cannot be reported separately. State Liaisons are not required to report their position on the bill, only the legislation on which the lobbying is being performed.","https://www.sos.state.co.us/",,,,,,,"02/15/2016","State",,,"CDOS - Colorado Department of State","Tabular",,,,,,,,,"Monday night after midnight",,,,,,,,,"https://www.sos.state.co.us/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subcontractors are always another lobbyist or lobbying firm, and have to be a registered lobbyist in the current fiscal year. State Liaisons as registered lobbyists are differentiated from professional lobbyists in that they cannot subcontract to other lobbyists.

CDOT’s surface treatment program is generally able to achieve the target established by the Transportation Commission at the beginning of each year. The annual target continues to be established each year at a level lower than the prior year’s actual level, which is indicative of the continued system deterioration caused by insufficient investment in surface treatment.

As project details focus over time, planned project funding may be modified or redirected among Regional projects to optimize expenditures and construct the complete scope of STP work planned withing each Region. 4. As project details focus over time, funding may be redirected, if approved, between the Regions to optimize statewide expenditures and construct the complete scope of STP work planned statewide. 5. As needed to address typical project delivery constraints, Regions may move listed projects between planning years while maintaining planning total amounts over time. 6. Projects on the STP Planning lists that are constructed using non-SUR funds may be replaced on the list with new projects as long as the established STP and PMS criteria remain satisfied. 7.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

These structures include all reservoirs built after April 17, 1941, on watercourses which the state engineer has determined to be ""normally dry"" and having a capacity of not more than ten acre-feet and a vertical height not exceeding fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway. Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.
Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S. (1990). Note: The structure can be larger than specified under section 37-87-122, however, it then will be evaluated and must be constructed pursuant to section 37-87-105.","1641","2015-09-03T20:48:00.000Z","2020-11-11T07:04:00.000Z","Water","livestock water tank erosion control,dam safety,reservoir","686","Division of Water Resources","","Public Domain","published",,,,"Division of Water Resources",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://data.colorado.gov/resource/r2rp-ecjb.json",,"http://water.state.co.us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://water.state.co.us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dataset was updated in March of 2017.  The Colorado Household Medication Take-Back Program is now expanding with a goal of establishing at least one permanent collection location in every Colorado county. All locations can accept prescribed controlled substances (e.g. Percocet, Vicodin, Xanax, Ritalin and Adderall) along with other prescribed and over-the-counter medications.

The success of the program depends on its proper use.

Some of the first fish production facilities in the country were established in this state. Unlike other states located in the southern tier and coastal areas of the U.S., Colorado does not have a reputation as a major producer of aquacultured products. A semi-arid, continental-temperate climate, resulting in a relative scarcity of water, and a land-locked border discourage widespread use of ""traditional"" forms of aquaculture that require large amounts of flowing or standing water and year-round, sub-tropical temperatures. As a result of the relative limitations imposed on traditional aquaculture by the state’s natural resources and climate, some individuals and companies have resorted to more innovative approaches and technologies for producing warmwater aquatic organisms. Additionally, they have begun to take advantage of man-made resources and some natural resources that are unique to Colorado (abundant sunshine and significant geothermal resources) by turning to indoor, high-density production in water recirculation tank systems as a means to conserve water, to economically heat water for the production of warmwater fishes, and to retain these valuable resources within the production system.  When these indoor fish production techniques are coupled with the production of plants (an integrated approach called aquaponics), production and conservation of resources are enhanced even more. Complementing the interest in the private sector in new aquaculture opportunities, Colorado state government restructured its jurisdiction over aquaculture activities. Fish production has now been formally recognized as an agricultural pursuit and is entitled to the same kinds of benefits and incentives as other agricultural activities.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a “rolling average” of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics used by many federal, state, tribal, and local leaders. The U.S. decennial census is to provides counts of people for the purpose of Congressional apportionment, the ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. The ACS does not provide official counts of the population in between censuses. Some American Community Survey questions have been asked by the census since it first began in 1790. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. For example, in the case of employment statistics, both surveys ask about employment status during the week prior to the survey. However, data from the decennial census are typically collected between March and August, whereas data from the ACS are collected each month and reflect employment throughout the year. Differences in these responses may in turn affect data on commuting, occupation, and industry. It is anticipated that the short form (age, gender, race) will continue to be distributed to all households every 10 years. A major advantage of the ACS is ensuring communities with residents in group housing get a fair share of federal funds. Group housing facilities (also called ""group quarters"") are randomly selected throughout the year depending on the size of your facility. It is the extra attention to detail that reduces some of the common and seemingly unavoidable errors generated by the previous long form.

These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions which have broadband access are located; this can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching connectivity goals. Although it is constantly being improved upon, ultimately we aim for this data set to evolve into a reliable resource for emergency response services.  Web Map Services - Please note that the endpoint below also offers links for JSON, SOAP, WMS, and WFS.

Overcounts are known to exist in student and dual-residence populations, while undercounts are a given for homeless and illegal immigrants. Errors arise from both sampling and non-sampling methods. Sampling errors are misrepresentations of a larger population based on the selection of the representative sample. Accuracy of the estimates depend in part on how typical the people within the sampled housing units are to others within their area. The Census estimates sampling error based on the population and its extent of variability. The long-form of the Census is distributed to a subset of households, and includes additional data related to households, economy, employment, occupation, as well as occupancy and building structure data. Household fields include: Total Households, Total Families, Households by Household Type by Household Size, Persons in Group Quarters by Detailed Group Quarters Type, Persons 25 Years and Over by Educational Attainment, Persons 16 Years and Over by Labor Force and Employment Status, Median Household Income, Median Family Income, Per Capita Income, Persons by Poverty Status in Previous Year.

QCEW publishes every NAICS industry for the more than 3,000 counties in the United States. The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by State unemployment insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. Publicly available files include data on the number of establishments, monthly employment, and quarterly wages, by NAICS industry, by county, by ownership sector, for the entire United States. These data are aggregated to annual levels, to higher industry levels (NAICS industry groups, sectors, and supersectors), and to higher geographic levels (national, State, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)). Employment data under the QCEW program represent the number of covered workers who worked during, or received pay for, the pay period including the 12th of the month. Excluded are members of the armed forces, the self-employed, proprietors, domestic workers, unpaid family workers, and railroad workers covered by the railroad unemployment insurance system. Wages represent total compensation paid during the calendar quarter, regardless of when services were performed.

This procedure also uses data from several sources, including the CPS, the CES program, State UI systems, and the decennial census, to create estimates that are adjusted to the statewide measures of employment and unemployment.
