The services include answering telephone calls from current account holders in the MPCT, recording details about the caller and the reason for the call, documenting certain other call details, compiling all messages received for the day, and submitting those messages daily to CSPM staff.    Daily messages are to be forwarded in Word or Adobe format to CSPM via email at the end of each business day (5:00 p.m.) but no later than 6:00 p.m. It is anticipated that the vendor will need to provide these services for approximately 3 months.
