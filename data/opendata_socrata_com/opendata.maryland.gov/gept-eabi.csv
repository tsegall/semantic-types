"Habitat for Humanity of Wicomico County","908 W. Isabella Street","Salisbury, MD 21801","Mon. - Fri.: 9:00am - 5:00pm","Phone: 410-546-1551","Fax: 410-546-1310","http://www.wicomicohabitat.org","<p>Habitat for Humanity of Wicomico County just dedicated their 60th home! With our 13th home in the Church Street neighborhood completed, we have started renovating one more. We plan to break ground on another home late spring of 2015. If you haven't heard about us in the news in Salisbury, maybe you saw a little bit about us on The Daily Show!</p>     <p>Habitat for Humanity of Wicomico County is a non-profit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry, affiliated with Habitat for Humanity International. The local affiliate is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors with nine standing committees. Our staff consists of an Executive Director, Operations Manager, part-time Administrative Assistant, Construction Manager, Neighborhood Revialization Coordinator, Americorps Family Selection & Volunteer Coordinator, and five ReStore employees. </p>     <p>We opened the first Habitat ReStore on the Delmarva Peninsula in November 2005, on Shiloh Street in Salisbury. In 2009 we relocated our affiliate office and ReStore to 908 W. Isabella Street. The ReStore accepts donations of new an gently used building materials and major appliances, and offers those items for sale for 10 - 50% of original retail value. Net profits from the ReStore pay salaries, office operations, and overhead so that all donations and mortgage payments can be used to build Habitat homes. </p>     <p>By providing a hand-up rather than a hand-out. Habitat helps families realize their dream of owning a home. Families who qualify are able to experience homeownership through a committment of sweat equity, a 30-year no interest mortgage and the expectation that they will continue to support other Habitat projects. </p>     <p>Funds needed to build the houses come from mortgage payments, individual and business donations , and charitable foundations within Wicomico County. We also host events, such as Chefs for Habitat to raise funds. Properties are acquired through donations, purchases from landowners or an agreement with local government, often with the aid of government grants.</p>","https://portal.dhcd.state.md.us/GIS/images/CITC/Sandtown_Habitat.jpg","https://portal.dhcd.state.md.us/GIS/images/logos/Habitat_Logo.gif","2015-07-15T00:00:00.000","http://www.wicomicohabitat.org/donate/index.php"
