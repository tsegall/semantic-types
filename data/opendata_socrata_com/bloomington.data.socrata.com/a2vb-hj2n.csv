On Saturday, my 3-year-old child tripped and fell over a new patch in the street outside our house on Greenwood Avenue. Apparently, some of my neighbors wrote to you last week to report the bad condition of the street. On Thursday/Friday(?), several large potholes were filled in, but it seems to be fast emergengy patching. Some of the patches are now bumps instead of holes, with loose tarmac around the patch.  First, I WOULD like to say thank you for acting on this so quickly. But I do have two questions: (i) Is the street scheduled for proper repair in the near future? and (ii) Is the sidepath at the end of the street, between Greenwood and Southdowns, also scheduled for improvement? My interest in this issue is not only as a resident. I am a member of the Rogers/Binford Safe Routes to School Committee, and I am concerned about upkeep for the children who use this as the main pedestrian route to school from the SoMax neighborhood.

There has been an ongoing issue with potholes that have grown to take over the entire street. Additionally, the entire road isn't paved, as the last house on the street has to drive through dirt to get to their driveway. 

The entire last 100 ft. of road is getting to the point where it's completely destroyed, and I'm optimistic that someone can examine the road and pave it, as well as complete the work to the end. Someone filled in potholes a few years ago, however I don't believe the entire road has been paved in some time.

I am just wondering who is responsible for street/landscape maintenance along certain streets in the city and county that I travel often.  Along Smith Rd., just north of Hillside, there was a lot of brush that has been cut down but nothing else and an ugly partial fence is still standing.  The new roundabout at Sare Rd. and Rogers….who is responsible for maintaining the landscaping that was installed.  It is a bunch of weeds right now.  Along south Highland, just north of Rogers, there is a curve that is alway full of potholes and the street and sidewalk are a mess.  On Sare Rd., at the entrance to Hyde Park, who is responsible for a mess of grass clippings that is always left after the grass is allowed to grow very, very long.  It is still there.  Just some questions.  I tried to attach photos but I have not had success.  Thanks.   Debbie Kuratko","Street Department",,"Bloomington","IN",,,,,"7"

The eastbound Stop sign on Maxwell @ Highland, in Elm Heights, is OFTEN ignored. 

I have seen cars race right through it without even the pretense of slowing down. On foot, I have jumped out behind the car as it sped on, waving my hands and shouting ""STOP SIGN!!"", and once a driver waved an acknowledgment. Another time, driving north on Highland, I turned and followed the offender, honking and blinking my lights hoping s/he would notice that someone had noticed and be alert next time. 

The Stop sign is quite visible, not obscured by overhanging trees, so I am stumped. But I wonder if it could be moved closer to the road, enlarged, painted (the post too) a more neon/catchy red, and/or moved to the CENTER of the intersection (tricky for the snowplows, I know), and/or a ""Stop-sign alert"" sign added well before, or maybe it could be removed altogether with appropriate alerts posted for the north/south drivers, which might be safer than assuming people will stop.  This is a potentially lethal situation for drivers, bikers, and walkers in a very pedestrian-heavy neighborhood.

The repair work was OUTSTANDING, by the way! The promptness and quality of the repair work was spot-on ... many thanks to the City!  

However, after a few months we've noticed that the asphalt used for the repair appears to now be ""separating"" from the original pavement of the East edge of street (see attached photo). 

Our concern is that as winter approaches, there will be opportunities for water/snow/ice to accumulate, freeze, and actually cause *more* damage to the original repair work.  

Can we please request to have the City come check out this repair work to see if it needs additional work?  Thank you so much in advance!
