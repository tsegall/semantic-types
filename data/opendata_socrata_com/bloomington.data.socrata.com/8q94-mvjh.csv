But it wasn't until I began working full-time on the west side of town, commuting daily from Seventeenth Street to Liberty Drive (by way of 45/46 and 37), that I realized just how much of a problem this town has with snow removal.

First of all, I'm originally from Northwest Indiana, where snowfall accumulates to more than 3 feet at times and does not have a chance to melt down overnight before another snow fall. My hometown gets lake-effect snow on top of naturally occurring snowfall from the months of November well into early March. This weather does not faze our road workers, nor does it deter our drivers. 

None of us need chains on our tires, plows and salt of our own, or large SUVs with expensive, winter-weather tires to get to work or to school. Because our roads are plowed and salted before we even wake up in the morning.

This is why I find it ridiculous that I cannot get to work, schools are closed and most businesses are closed when there are merely three to four inches of snow on the ground. This just blows my mind.

As a full-time employee of a large company located on the West side of town, I commute from near the football stadium to the bypass and onto 37, before using West Second Street to complete my morning drive.

When I cannot safely make it to work in the morning, it is a shame. I almost find it laughable that this large, thriving city with so much to offer cannot sufficiently provide for its residents a simple task such as plowing and salting the roads.

I'd like to reference the snippet provided on the city's street department website as an example of my bone to pick:

""The Street Department is in charge of keeping the City of Bloomington's streets free of ice and snow during inclement weather. Whenever there is a danger of icy or snowy conditions on the roadways of the city, the Street Department will monitor conditions and respond accordingly. When snow or ice begins accumulating on the streets, plowing and/or salting operations will commence.""

Compared to other cities I've visited in the Midwest, the street department here seems lazy and inept to say the very least. In my hometown, the plows work all night, or at least begin working at 4 a.m. They don't wait for snow to ""begin accumulating on the streets"" until they *actually* do something, unlike what is written in the description of Bloomington's street department website.

I realize budgets are tight and have likely already been set for 2014, as far as city services are concerned. But some re-organization of services, I feel, is in order. Some suggestions for improvement of this essential city service would be to prepare accordingly for bad weather by salting the roads prior to snowfall and ice accumulation. This way, as the snow and ice melts during the early hours of the evening, the salt will help to prevent ice from forming on major intersections (such as 45/46 and North Walnut Street, where I almost slid into a full spin this morning while making a turn at 10 miles per hour) and major roadways like Highway 45/46 and Highway 37. 

Last night, at 6 p.m. when I got home from work, I already had a winter weather advisory pop up on my phone that stated snow accumulation was possible throughout the night, and that ice was possible as well.

If I'm just a basic resident receiving this notification, then surely a city employee of the street department would receive it. Or *should* receive it.

Another suggestion would be to employ plows that will work at 4:30 in the morning, or earlier, to ensure the roads are clear. I feel this is imperative. Most people who work in this city cannot get to work at 7 a.m., let alone 8 or 9 a.m. on some days, because absolutely *nothing* has been done to ensure the safety of the roads during snowy/icy weather. This causes people to miss work, students to miss important classes and city businesses to lose customers and money.

When it all is said and done, I cannot believe that this city cannot take well enough care of its roads - preventative care - to ensure the safety of its roads, when other cities have the ability to clear and salt and prepare for this weather (exponentially worse weather) without breaking a sweat. This isn't just a northern Indiana person speaking, this is a Bloomington resident speaking. And I would rather not have to call off work for a measly 3 inches of snow, when I can remember going to school as a child when there were 3 feet of snow on the ground - because the streets were clear.

Thank you for hearing me out and I hope something can be done.

Before writing this letter, I researched your site and discovered The Highlands neighborhood, and ways in and out of the addition, are exclusively excluded from within the city limits.  It appears there is a cut out just around my neighborhood excluding it from city snow/ice removal.  Now I realize why there is a huge difference in road conditions and safety once you cross Tapp Rd.  With how curved Rockport Rd is in that stretch and how many pot holes and construction obstacles there seem to be, it is very dangerous to have even a little bit of snow and ice on that road.  I was very surprised that this doesn't fall under the city's responsibility considering how many residents there are in that neighborhood and how many children and school buses come in and out.  I work at the hospital, a 3.5 mile drive, and have a very difficult time getting to and from work on that road.  I have had to get a ride multiple times during this severe winter, as the hospital does not close and always needs its employees to be there, safe and on time.  I want to know if there are options to get that road cleared during winter weather to increase safety for the city's many residents of The Highlands neighborhood?","Street Department",,"Bloomington","IN",,,,

We do have one request for our cul-de-sac, though (Skylark Court, east off of Highland Avenue). We'd appreciate it if the plow drivers could return and plow the large pile of snow covering the lone storm water drain off to the side, so as to uncover the drain. Also, in the future, can they please  avoid piling snow that storm water drain. It is the drain for the entire cul-de-sac. In the photo, this location is shown approximately by the red arrow. When snow is piled over this drain, as snow melts from anywhere uphill, or if it rains, the snow pile caps off the drain and the bottom of the cul-de-sac floods. The storm water drain is at the bottom of the cul-de-sac, which is all one slope, so A LOT of water runs to that one drain. One concern we have with the flooding is that several utility hook-ups (electricity, telephone, and cable) are just a foot or two away from the drain. Things have been done this way for years, and we have always taken it upon ourselves to shovel the drain clear, but this year we realized it would be a great idea to ask if the plow drivers could do this instead.

My family purchased this home on a cul-de-sac 4 years ago. Last year we removed our mailbox and installed a retaining wall because of already existing poor driaining issues in our area and the city keeps piling snow on top of our property and now the wall. I called Sunday evening and the woman I spoke with said, ""cul-de-sacs"" were tricky and the guys were out there long hours and were working in bad conditions while being exhausted. But she would be sure to give Joe my address and he would look into my complaints."" I called Sunday because the had packed up a huge amount once again on our wall and blocked off half of my driveway. I was then told if we could get in and out of our driveway this should not be an issue or an emergency. Understandable  but if the job was successfully completed then first time you would not have to come back. I woke up Monday not surprised to see even more snow had been packed up to our ever growing pile. So my issues are where is all this water going? There is no drainage in this area and all this snow will cause hazardous conditions with melting and freezing and having nowhere to go. Why are you bringing all of the snow into our cul-de-sac? Why are you continuously putting snow on a stone wall where someone could get injured after I have now reported it three times? There are a ton of kids in our neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods and kids like to jump in big piles of snow. I will not be held liable because the city of Bloomington will not listen to or work with its residents. Finally when you contact the city of Bloomington instead of working with you why do they always seem to retaliate against you and make the situation worse? This is what happened last year when the plow driver asked me how I suggested he plow with my ""plow experience."" I have many other picture but this shows the pile today and how large it is and how spread out the city left. If it snows anymore my neighbors might not be able to back out of their driveway.

My house is in the alley between Kirkwood and 4th, and there's been no plowing here since it began snowing a week or two ago. It's normally not a big issue other than the ice that builds up and makes walking dangerous, but after this storm I'm pretty well blocked in completely. The complicating factor is that this is a fairly narrow alley, with a drainage ditch at one point that can make navigating it with large equipment dicey - I wouldn't recommend anything bigger than a pickup with a plow come through, if you are in fact able to dispatch anyone here anytime soon. I understand that even if you can it may be a while, but wanted to put the request in regardless, as the postal service is having a less than ideal time getting down here and the snow compacts into ice if it isn't cleared.

I am trapped and not able to leave. I cannot shovel the snow because of my disabling conditions.  There’s nowhere for my caregiver to park.  Please help, I’m trapped.  

Also, when I called yesterday evening to report the issue 812–349–3448, someone named Jared, the operator, was very condescending and sarcastic on the phone to me. Extremely cavalier and quite nasty. It seems as though he delighted in telling me that there wasn’t anything that could be done. His tone and inflection were both rude and patronizing.
