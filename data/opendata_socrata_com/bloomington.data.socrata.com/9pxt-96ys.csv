I bike every morning to work from Old 37 just South of Bethell into town. This road is posted as 20-35mph, but cars and trucks travel super fast. When I'm in a car, I always drive this speed limit and other cars barrel up on me, so I know they're going at least 40+. I sit on my back porch and just sigh at how irresponsible people are as they speed past my house.

This morning right where Old 37 crosses Walnut into Lower Cascades, a guy in a truck smart-ass-edly pointed to the new trail that has the bridge - indicating I should be on it. I pulled up beside him at the light and he made some more smart ass remarks about the city spending all his money and bikes are supposed to ride on that trail...

I just backed away and didn't say a word, although rage fueled my body the rest of the ride to work. I know I should just shake it off, but these kind of acts are a weekly - sometimes daily occurrence. And this is one of the nicer things that could have happened - even though he was seriously red-faced-pissed. It could have gotten ugly - I'm sure.

One, bikes obey the same laws as cars and he's off base with that comment. And two, I would ride that little bit of trail if it went all the way to Marlin Hills. He wants me to inconvenience and endanger myself by crossing in front of him to get on that little stretch of trail before the stop light, just so he doesn't have to wait the 10 seconds to pass me like a decent human being. I usually just hold my breath and drive as straight as possible until I reach the stop light and get on the trail that goes into Lower Cascades. I do ride the trail, just not on the North side of Walnut. Well, I do ride it when going North on my ride home, but I still have to get off and onto Old 37 to reach Marlin Hills.

I average about 20mph on flat land, so when I go through Lower Cascades, cars should barely be passing me, but every single morning I see cars flying through there. I wish for a cop to pull them over, but it never happens. I rarely see an officer on Lower Cascades or Old 37. We seriously need speed traps for the morning and evening rush hours at least a few times a week, please.

I have some questions.

1. Are there plans to extend the Lower Cascades trail up to Marlin Hills? That is a very scary stretch of road to ride.

2. Can we get some police patrolling Old 37 and Lower Cascades? Please. These are well known bike routes, but these country guys in big trucks are very dangerous. They get some sort of kick out of scaring cyclists. Other friends that bike have similar experiences. A couple days ago a young boy in a big F250 red pickup gave his truck extra gas as he passed me, then a bit ahead, my wife, just to blow a billow of black exhaust in our faces. I wish Indiana had some laws against emissions.

3. Are cyclists required to ride on these new trails as that guy indicated? If not, can we put up signs so that people like this guy are educated. I wish these people would read the laws before speaking. Or just have some common decency. Or even require intensive pedestrian and cyclist education before getting a drivers license.

4. What do I do if I'm confronted on foot by one of these angry motorists? Am I protected by law if force is necessary?

5. Can I report license plates to the police? I wish I could be an undercover cyclist officer.

6. Can we get some speed bumps all through Lower Cascades? Maybe more speed limit warnings and stiffer fines through a park and bike routes? Also some of the signs are covered by tree limbs.",,"3209-3299 N Ramble Rd W","Bloomington","IN",,"39.20525360","-86.53379822","POINT (-86.53379822 39.2052536)"

Hello, I am a cycling commuter. I go from the east side to the west side of town and use 7th street and the new tunnel under bypass.  

The new 7th street connection to this tunnel has an extra high ""lip"" on the sidewalk/driveway entrance to this tunnel.  If you could shave it down to create a more gentle slope for skinny bike tires it would make the ride from the road into the tunnel (going east) much safer.  thank you.",,,"Bloomington","IN",,,,

I am not asking for compensation or threatening to sue.  I just want to bring light to a situation that is possibly hazardous and/or costly.  As I was biking to a meeting at work last night, I ran over a large steel plate in the middle of College Ave.  It is in front of the construction site where the Waffle House used to be.  It nearly threw me off my bike, and I could have easily been run over by other cars.  Luckily, it just popped both my tires and no further damage was taken.  I would love to see a warning sign, or some sort of reflective material on these large steel plates in the future.  Just something to thank about.  I thank you in advance for your responsiveness.

On Monday around 11am, my $1200 bike was stripped of all of its parts that were not locked to the bike rack. This happened right outside my office in a somewhat busy parking lot, in downtown Bloomington, in broad daylight. From the security footage it took the person about 20 minutes. A police report was filed and the officer mentioned he'd seen similar cases recently. After posting about this on social media, I've now heard numerous cases of bikes either being stripped completely or partially during the day at various spots downtown over the past couple weeks. Had there been any media or warnings issued, I would have certainly brought my bike into my office, rather than risk losing most of it. I realize it's just a possession (and not a life) and can be replaced, but given that this seems to be a growing trend, a warning and increased awareness would be helpful.","Police Department",,"Bloomington","IN",,,,

Many of our faculty, staff and students (as well as others) have to cross 10th street to get to their parking lots behind Geology or the Fee Lane garage.

Good morning,

Thank you for your uReport request regarding Rose Avenue.  At this point, the likelihood of a sidewalk on Rose Avenue is very low.  You probably have noticed changes on 3rd Street as a result of the City's Greenways Implementation Plan, however.  Rose Avenue in the segment you describe is designated as a neighborhood greenway as well.  So you will see some additional signage and striping at the 3rd & Rose intersection if you haven't already.

Thank you again for your uReport request.

Thanks,

I am unsure if this is the best forum to voice this concern, but hopefully it can be redirected if it is incorrect. I am deeply concerned with the motorized scooters that have appeared around town. I love walking the B-line trail and have always found cyclists to be courteous and respectful of the pedestrians like myself. The motorized scooters have made it stressful and dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians alike. Just as I am not allowed to walk into motorized traffic, I believe any motorized vehicle should be banned from the B-line and public sidewalks. The speed at which they go makes them untennable and unsafe. Futhermore, they do not promote health or fitness as they do not require any effort of engage. My godsons are just now learning to ride their bikes. How can they safely do so with these fast-moving vehicles wisping by them on the few areas they can safely ride? I hope that, like Indiana University, the City of Bloomington swiftly bans these hazardous and irksome motorized vehicles as soon as possible. It will be tragic if the B-line becomes just another noisy road for motorized vehicles. Especially so soon after the bikeshare project was implemented.

Eastbound at walnut, the beg button is AWOL. It was too far from the roadway to be pushed by a cyclist anyways.  The two-stage crossing (beg button in the refuge island) is worth nothing to me because I can only push it if my kids (trailer) are hanging out in the southbound traffic lanes.  There is literally no traffic calming for northbound traffic on walnut here, which is still largely unwilling to yield even when the lights are in operation.

The stop signs at Washington and Lincoln are facing the wrong direction.  It is important to make allen inconvenient to drivers, but it is also essential to make it super convenient (and safe) for cyclists.

The routes through bryan park suck for cyclists.

Just reiterating a bunch of notes in case excellence ever becomes an interest of the city.

But I’m wondering what the city plans to do to ensure that pedestrians and also bicyclists are treated with respect as our court neighborhoods become ever busier due to construction, flipping houses, and implementation of the new UDO.

It was raining and I slammed on my brakes but it was too late and I hit him with my truck.  The man who is a teacher at IU ended up with two spinal fractures, a horribly broken leg and a concussion.  He was at fault but if you take a look at that hill it is very steep.  I think his brakes locked up and he hydroplaned into the road.  There was busy traffic going both ways on Hillside.  This happened at 8:35 AM in the rain in front of a school bus from Templeton.  I live in the Arden neighborhood and we walk our children to school at Harmony often.  There is NO CROSSWALK anywhere between High Street and Henderson Street.  It makes me nervous to try and send my kids to school on bikes or even let them walk.  I hope that there maybe something that could be done at that intersection in the form of a sign or flashing light and some paint across the street to make people aware that bicyclist maybe crossing there.  As I was going down Hillside today, I saw another bicyclist shoot out across the road from Olive up to Weatherstone.  I think the bicyclist don’t always know how steep that hill is and you can’t really see the traffic on Hillside until you are at the bottom of it.  I was 8 months pregnant on my way to a OB appt at 8:35 when this wreck accured.  Traffic was very heavy and everyone was going the speed limit.  Even though he was at fault in the eyes of the law, this accident ruined his life I’m sure.

I think our neighborhood is actually putting together a committee as so many people are concerned and keep complaining about speeding traffic on east morningside drive but we had a neighbor suggest a great idea of parking on the street or otherwise narrowing the street to slow down traffic, not just speed bumps.  So ideas like https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/12-ways-slow-down-traffic-car-oriented-city/262221/.  A neighbor suggest lines (or art) could be painted as an option to try.  I forget what city it was but they simply painted parallel lines a few feet in from both sides of the road and it slowed traffic.  Maybe this is cheaper for the city and can be tried?  I hope someone from our neighborhood reaches out more formally soon and gives you all a call.  I think we'll be part of the super cool 7-line someday?  And guess we'll have something change then probably that hopefully will fix this.  Maybe we can get the narrowing lines until then?  The street is oddly too good right now, as it's clear and wide and easy to drive fast on!  Can we get a random basketball goal and court painted?  that would make cars slow down and think twice :)  Take back our streets! Pleaes don't forget us.

The Park Ridge park is receiving increased usage these days. It's a great park with wonderful amenities and we are very proud of it! We monitor it carefully to be sure all is in good repair, the grounds are litter free, and we interact with City staff as they visit to maintain the park. 
As a result of this usage, parking has become an item that needs closer attention and management. With two residential homes on the circle with driveways, occasionally the two driveways are occasionally partially blocked; at least to the point where the residents of the two homes are challenged to enter or exit their driveways.
Suggestion: would you survey the circle area and consider placing stripes to designate parking spaces? This would insure if vehicles park within the designated spaces, blocking driveways would not be an issue. One resident has medical needs and occasionally requires emergency transport.

Additionally, please consider a yellow ""do not park"" grid stenciled to mark the walk/bike path entry off the circle. This area is often blocked by parked cars. The result is walking or biking around a vehicle to use the path. If a person in a wheelchair wished to enter the path (at the bottom of the hill), they are unable to access the path if a vehicle parks in front of the entry.","Engineering","Park Ridge Park","Bloomington","IN",,,,

I received the following email message from Frances Elizabeth Sheets <fsheets@iu.edu> dated Fri, Sep 2, 2022 at 12:11 PM
To: ""martipa@bloomington.in.gov"" <martipa@bloomington.in.gov>

""To whom it may concern, 

Let me get right down to business: 7th street is an absolute fucking nightmare. 

I grew up in Bloomington, and now live close to downtown as I am a student at IU. This means that I navigate 7th street every single day. Let me tell you - this is not an easy task. 

I recognize and appreciate the effort that the city has put into the new bike lane running from campus to the B-line. As someone who rides a bike/electric scooter to get around, this bike lane is great. However, the bike lane coupled with the removal of stop signs between Indiana and Walnut has caused more problems than it has solved. 

Problem number 1: Absolutely no one knows when it is their turn to go. Specifically, when crossing 7th on Grant and Dunn, cars rarely (in my experience) yield to cyclists. This means that I have been inches away from being hit by a car multiple times while using the bike lane. There is no signage instructing cars to yield to those in the bike lane or vice versa. This is an immediate safety issue to me, and one that is relatively unavoidable as 7th street is the road I have to use to get to work, class, and back home every day. Since there is no bike lane on 10th street, using it as an alternate route is not a safer option. 

Problem number 2: Flow of traffic. Because there are no stop signs on 7th the flow of traffic is constantly a struggle. About half of all drivers stop and attempt to let pedestrians/cyclists/other cars either cross or turn. However, this often only happens in one lane, which means cars are regularly slowing, stopping, and then having to speed back up again because lines of traffic in one direction form very quickly. I experienced this literally five minutes before sitting down to write this email: there was a line of traffic waiting to turn from Grant, multiple cars slowing down traffic attempting to yield to those at the Grant stop sign, and myself and other pedestrians/cyclists trying to cross the road. Again, this is a blatant safety issue. 

Problem number 3: Visibility. This is more of a potential problem. Young trees have been planted along the median between the bike lane and the road. When these trees reach maturity, they will drastically lower visibility between the bike lane and the road, making the problems mentioned above even more dangerous. 

Since the stop signs were removed around six months ago, I have witnessed AT LEAST six car crashes on 7th between Grant and Dunn alone. I have also witnessed more drivers than I can count accidentally turning into the bike lane instead of onto the road. Pedestrians also walk in the bike lane frequently, and there was even a city-sponsored run/walk where participants were blocking the entire bike lane in front of the IMU. 

As someone who has both driven and biked along 7th, the removal of stop signs has not helped at all. If anything, it makes people drive unreasonably fast or unreasonably slow. Everyone I have talked to about this issue has agreed with me, so I know I am not alone in my frustration. 

Please, PLEASE at the very least put more signage in this area. It is quite dangerous, and as a resident of the city, the new design makes me question whether or not those in charge of city planning have actually ever driven downtown. 

I apologize if my tone comes off as aggressive, but in the past week alone I have almost been hit by four cars when using the bike lane!!""

Thanks,
