This is a school bus stop for the high school so safety for the children is a concern. As I think back, I have a distant recollection that the light may have failed several days ago as the sunrise is later, but this morning I verified the problem.
 
My home is located at this corner (3101 S. Daniel Street). The light on Daniel 200 feet south is working. 
 
I hope that the safety of the children makes repair a priority as the corner where they wait is very dark in the morning. Thank you.","Street Department",,"Bloomington","IN",,,,

The time of day it needs to be adjusted is the morning and evening rush hours.
Also, your sensor form the turn signal heading east turning towards Marsh does not work properly and doesn't always recognize when a vehicle is at the light waiting for the left turn signal. The signal control at this intersection has been a joke way too long and I find it hard to believe this is the first time your have heard about it. Open your minds...

There are only two lights - one on each end of the street - leaving the stretch in between to be dangerously dark and a hazard to walkers, bicyclists, drivers, and residents alike. Furthermore, with nearby cases of vandalism, theft, as well as the recent disappearance and death of an IU Student in the area, many residents have become concerned over the lack of lighting on the street. There are several utility poles lining the street where street lamps could be placed.

Vernal Pike is very dark and dangerous at night, especially for pedestrians and bicyclists (of which I am both). I am requesting lights be installed at that location in order to make the area safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and cars. The Waterman neighborhood has many residents who bicycle and walk through that part of the street, and they are at risk of being hit by cars. It is also a case of making people feel safe at night. Also, I am writing this as a property owner (1521 W. 8th Street) and resident of four years who would like to feel safer and has only just found out about this UReport process, otherwise I would have submitted this request years ago.","Public Works Department",,"Bloomington","IN",,,,

When we students come home late in the night, we get off the bus and it is very dark, it is kind of eerie to walk in such a dark area, even if it is just less than half a mile. It really strikes me that there is no public lights in an area like that, where there are hundreds of students. I was wondering if it is possible at all to contact somebody from the city government and request that a lamp be set up there -it is the corner of Hagan St and S. Park Ridge Rd.
I guess students come and go every year and nobody really cares or speak up about things like that, which may appear insignificant, but kind of matter. It is so dark, that sometimes when I come back home carrying my laptop with me, I need to be careful so as not to bump into something and fall and break the laptop. It is like you cannot actually see where you are walking.
I have wondered how these sort of things are handled here in bloomington.
So I am just curious to know if you think there is something that can be done to get some public lights in these streets."" - Lina Ochoa","Public Works Department","383 S Park Ridge RD","Bloomington","IN","47401","39.16294861","-86.47624969","POINT (-86.47624969 39.16294861)"

It is especially dark in between Lincoln and Washington street and at night you cannot see the sidewalk at all. Most people living on E12th street are students, many of whom have night classes ending as late as 9 or 10pm. My roommates and I specifically have classes ending at 8:30 and 9 when the streets are too dark to see anything. With the current atmosphere in Bloomington, many residents of 12th street feel unsafe walking home from class, work, or to their neighbors. Installing A street lamp or two would greatly improve the safety and comfort of people living on E 12th street. The attached photo shows just how dark the sidewalk is with out a flash light at night. No one should have to feel afraid of walking down their own street at 8pm and the addition of street lamps on E12th street can help fix this.","Public Works Department","200-210 East 12th Street","Bloomington","IN",,"39.17436981","-86.53199768","POINT (-86.53199768 39.17436981)"

My name is Kendall Burch and I am a student at Indiana University.  I live at 1309 N Washington Street Bloomington, IN 47408 in a duplex. The duplex was built this past summer and sits at the end of a dead end, where there is currently no light. 
Next to our house is several bushes with a trail leading to a parking lot for an apartment complex across the street.  My roommates and I have encountered more than one incident where we have seen individuals hiding in the trail at night because it is so dark.  The latest incident happened this past weekend, but by the time the Bloomington Police Department arrived the man fled on foot.  As citizens of Bloomington we feel we are in danger, providing a street light would make the area safer for everyone.  Please let me know if this is an option as soon as possible

Respectfully,

I was in communication with Christina Smith last fall regarding a street light that needs to be installed on S. Fess Ave. Preferably 821 S. Fess Ave., as that is the middle of the block. The 800 block of S. Fess is totally pitch black, unless there is a full moon. I'm not sure why this completely dark street, with two homebound senior citizens living on it (my neighbors), hasn't become a priority for a street light. Please consider taking care of this soon. Thank you! Previous correspondence below.

Ms. Fischman,
Thank you for communicating with the Department of Public Works regarding an additional lighting request along S. Fess Avenue.  Each year, we install street lights within the public right of way on a petition base and available funding. I have placed your request area on are list for future consideration.  At this time, we have quite an extensive list, therefore, it cannot predict when the light will be installed.

I have experienced this issue for many months, and have witnessed others not activating the left turn arrow.  Also, it appears that the light, itself, is twisted to slightly face south east, rather than due south.

It might be a good idea to repaint the stop indicator lines, as well.","Street Department",,"Bloomington","IN",,,,

The streetlight at this location is sometimes working properly (i.e., full brightness) when it's dark, off when it's light/bright during the day, and then there are times where the light is only at ~25% brightness, or it goes completely dark during the night time ... which, to me, defeats the purpose of having the streetlight in the first place.  I'm not sure if that's considered normal operation or if that means it's starting to have problems.

The neighbors whose homes are in front of this streetlight are worried whether it's working properly.  More important, they are concerned and don't feel safe when they go out at night and the streetlight is ""off"".

I don't know if this indicates a problem, so wanted to ask to have it looked into, as appropriate.
