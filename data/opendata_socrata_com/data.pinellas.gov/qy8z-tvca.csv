When she finished shopping, she exited the Market through the north exit and walked west on the south sidewalk of 1st Ave S. I was waiting for her at the corner of 1st Ave S and 1st Street S, and as she approached the corner she tripped over an elevated sidewalk slab and fell to the ground hitting her forehead and nose very hard. She was in severe pain and bleeding from her forehead and nose, so I called 911. I looked at the sidewalk where she had tripped and noticed that the sidewalk was not flat, unfortunately a sidewalk slab had become elevated due to a bulging tree root, and was now a trip hazard. The  911 medics responded quickly and were professional and supportive. They recommended that we go to the ER ASAP.  Luckily, the ER doctors found that her bones were not broken, and her bleeding wounds were not critical, and she was neurologically intact. So we were allowed to take her home, thankfully.  I would greatly appreciate it if the city would address the bulging sidewalk slab on the south side of 1st Ave S near the corner of 1st Street S.

The other dog, Lola, who is pictured in my photo is not as aggressive, but managed to break a huge hole in my fence. This is, I believe, my fourth complaint. My two dogs are in my house and are let out when we are home. I am tired of replacing fence slats and dealing with these people and their aggressive dogs. They are renters so they really don�t care.

My questions Sir/Madam is, do I have county permission to have it removed or is that is something you do? Or is there something we can do to save the tree? We are in the process of getting the entire perimeter wall repaired as there are other areas needing attention. This comes at a considerable cost to my residents. As the president of Country Oak Estates HOA Board, I wanted to ask for your help or any advice you could give us on what we are to do would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance

The traffic light at Tampa road and US Highway 19 works. 

It works so well that you're enjoying the functionality for 45 minutes at a red light in the left turn lane to turn onto Lake St George. 

Every return trip from walmart, 45 minute wait.

Every return trip from Publix, 45 minute wait. 

Every return trip from target, 45 minute wait. 

Obviously not actually 45 minutes, but it sure seems like it. It's converted to dog minutes for dramatic effect. 

Now, I get it. Grass is greener on the other side... I would just prefer to not watch it grow from an inch to an inch and 1/2 in the time I'm at the light. 

I've seen turtles cross 6 lanes of busy road faster than it takes for me to get through this light turning left onto lake St George. 

In the time it took at this light the USA deficit was fixed and there was world peace. 

Not to brag and flex my non existent power and figurative title... but I'm also the HOA president for Lake St George. 

Can I extend some figurative non existent Executive power and please convert this light to a blinking yellow turn after 6pm or 7pm?

Blinking yellow from 11am to 3pm? and also from 7pm to 6am? 

I know this request is drawn out and a full blown descriptive story... Im writing it while waiting to turn left onto Lake St George. 

Please save our sanity and add this to be a fabulous blinking yellow. 

I can't keep the pressure of thinking, If I go... will anyone know? But then don't because I know PCSO are like ninjas hiding behind every bush and palm tree. 

It just turned green. 

Warmest, 
Impatient in Palm Harbor","3390 Co Rd 752 Palm Harbor, FL 34684, USA","0",,,"Thu","Thu","Mon","Mon","993871","POINT (-82.723029479384 28.066940959648)","8","1","8","true"

The rt hand lane westbound on Curlew is frequently stopped. Drivers on Curlew cut over to the left lane or drive very fast to get around the stopped cars.  Cars exiting the school often narrowly avoid accidents trying to get into the u-turn lane- which has a solid line and should not be accessed from this point.  On top of this children are leaving school and crossing the sidewalk at this exit.

On Thursday, Sept 16, 2021 our water service was off. This was a neighborhood-wide problem. Your office acknowledged a problem at Meadow Lane\Woodlands drive in East Lake Woodlands. Simultaneously, a building in our condo association also had a water issue. Repairs were made and the service restored, but ever since those repairs were made, our water pressure has been substantially lower than before. To this day, the pressure has not been restored. Please create a work order to check and increase the water pressure in this neighborhood.

It seemed fine until the plumbing started backing up inside the house the following evening on Sunday 9/19/21. Verizon had done utility work years back and the city had to address a similar issue and it had been resolved, but we need the obstruction cleared again now as it did not exist prior to the crew being here yesterday. The fact that the water return outside is full indicates it is not clearing from the house to the street. Please send someone out to see if they can snake from the sewer return to the street or find the obstruction with a camera that resulted from the utility work being done now.

The dog area has broken fencing, broken doors, broken door handles, broken cage doors, broken cage in/out access areas to the dogs, broken AIR CONDITIONING FOR DAYS ON END, broken pipes leaking for days on end, torn up dry wall in the dogs kennels, slippery flooring, only one person taking care of 30+ dogs and up to 10 cats at one time by themselves with nobody else in the building, and discovered black mold behind the dry wall of rooms for the dogs and instead of finding out where it is from or getting rid of it they are just covering it back up with more dry wall. When more than 4 cats board they must make the cats kennel space smaller to make space for more cats eventually leading to the cats only having space to lay next to a litter box and have food and water in its face for the duration of its stay. The owners are not aware of the conditions their pets or the staff is enduring while in the care of saint Francis pet care center but this is what they endure while there. Many animals come out of the kennel with hot spots due to the humidity level in the kennel because of the air conditioning that only gets temporarily fixed when acting up while the major issue at hand with the air unit has yet to be fixed because it would require shutting down the kennel for a little bit. They would rather keep the kennel open and put the staff and animals at risk rather then update and fix the kennel. The animals are the priority as well as the staff and there is no regard for either at this facility by those in charge. The staff that works there has brought up these concerns multiple times and nothing has been done.","St Francis Pet Care Center 3591 Keystone Rd, Tarpon Springs, FL, 34688, USA",,,,"Sat",,"Mon","Mon","454849","POINT (-82.675169 28.145206)",,"1","1","true"

Lip of the culvert is about 10 inches above the creek, which means the creek will have to rise (flood) before going over the edge.  There is a crack where the water is coming through, to keep the creek level low.  Also, you can see where there has been erosion to the right (north) of the culvert.  Used sandbags to direct the rising water over the culvert.  Lastly, just off to the left of the picture, there has been erosion which leaves the sidewalk unsupported with dirt.  Could collapse and injure pedestrians.

Looks like the culvert will have to be replaced, lowered to keep the level of the creek below flood level in the Countrybrook Condominium complex.  Remove the concrete slab to the west of the culvert.  Regrade from the right of the culvert up to normal grade level.  Remove the sidewalk, add dirt and regrade to the culvert, replace the sidewalk.","3502-3506 Countryside Blvd N Palm Harbor, FL, 34684, USA","0",,,"Wed","Wed","Mon","Mon","1381034","POINT (-82.718455636024 28.049279849365)","19","1","19","true"

The level in the pond is way too low and all of the weeds on the bottom are showing and it looks really bad. The pond doesn't look too bad shortly after a rain storm but, a few hours later after a storm has passed, it looks bad. This drainage ditch is over 30 years old and may have sunk some due to normal erosion from the rain. It also looks like someone may have added three inches or inches drain pipes that go inside this as you see in the picture and that are at the same level as the pond is right now and I don't think those three drain pipes were there when that cement thing was initially put there but, I could be wrong. Can someone please come check this big cement ditch thing out and make sure it's draining properly and hasn't sunk some and is up to code?

DESCRIPTION
In the westbound lane of Tampa Road, directly in front of the mailbox at 835 Tampa Road in Palm Harbor, is a manhole that has a loose cover. I live right across the street in the Sherwood Forest RV Park facing Tampa Road. Every time a vehicle crosses that manhole, it sounds like shots are being fired . . . annoying during the day and keeping me from sleeping at night. Would you please secure that manhole cover properly? Thank you so much.

I am really hoping I found the right department to submit this request to! The street in regards to my address listed is barely hanging in there. It is riddled with cracks and bumps and potholes all along the street.

More specifically related to ME, there is a pothole on the street directly in front of my home that fills up with water and floods everytime it rains.

If someone could please come out to take a look/look into getting this issue fixed that would be amazing!

The east/westbound traffic signal stays green for WAY too long; even when there is no traffic going in those directions for several minutes.  The westbound/left turn/ northbound drivers on Park Blvd have NO time to clear that lane.  The other day it took me THREE cycles to turn left to go north.  The traffic in ALL directions needs to be synced.  Traffic at 113th and Park need to get a left turn signal at the same time!

Then last week they started framing out a roof to the balcony.  It is very tall, especially when compared to the majority of one story houses on the creek.  It looks like it is three stories!  See attached photo.

I did a brief search for applicable building code regarding max height.  All I found was something saying max height is two stories.

I checked environmental because that appears to be the department that deals with the overlay district in Crystal Beach but it is not a mangrove issue.

Good afternoon, I lhave some concerns about a permit for a single family dwelling at 689 Vincent Street in Crystal Beach.  There is a cluster of trees that will need to be removed for the proposed construction and they may fall under the 1.24.3 policy that relates to the Crystal Beach Community Overlay.   I don't have access to the plans or arborist report so but it looks like all but three of the trees in the cluster will need to be romved.  Will this have impacts on the remaining three trees and will they survive without the support that the cluster provides?  I understan development is the owners right and just wanted to verify that the appropriate steps and codes have been met before the tree removal beings.  Attached are a couple of pictures.  I tried leaving a mesage at your 464-3923 number and was not able to.

Too many fish which are too big for their tanks bumping into each other with no room to swim.
Crabs and crawfish in about a centimeter of water filled with feces with their claws and shells coming off climbing on top of one another
Algae does not appear to ever be cleaned off of tanks.
Too many birds in cages with their feathers plucked off from stress.
There are piles of garbage in the corners of the shop as well as dirty fish tanks and a pungent smell that is very obvious from the moment you walk in.

If you are not the appropriate agency, please forward to who is.

On Monday July 12th at about 7:30 am, 2 of us were getting ready to cross Trinity Boulevard from the Starkey bike path extension.  We pushed the signal which starts the yellow flashing lights at the crossing.  We checked the status of the traffic to ensure that the drivers in both directions were stopping before proceeding.  The first cars in both directions did stop; however, 2 eastbound cars approaching the first eastbound car crashed into each other in their attempts to slow down and stop, causing a dangerous situation for us and the other vehicles.  Besides the drivers not paying attention, Trinity Blvd does not have pre-warning flashing lights and sign to better warn people about the upcoming crossing (there is a sign, but it is small and certainly not enough).  This situation is better handled on Keystone Road near Brooker Creek where there is a large, visible sign with flashing lights many yards before the actual crossing so drivers are better forewarned.

This road is an exit corridor for all circumstances  including hurricane and other emergencies.   It is utilized by many many homes and subdivisions including businesses for daily useage. It is also only one of two exits for all of these homes in case of emergencies. Some of these homes are in a flood zone. 
95th street barely fits 2 cars across. 
It is in dire need of repair to not only widen the road but to replace the retention culverts to REAL underground pipes. 
With the future of more homes being built on both sides of this road, there is more than an urgency to make these valid repairs. 
The repercussions that will happen when all these homeowners cannot escape their own neighborhood in an emergency situation: Safety is foremost!  Please address this situation.

People use it as a pass through to get to the neighborhoods off 46th st and fly down 50th Ave. It has been a persistent issue for years including a child getting hit and nothing is ever done. We have done the petitions, the complaints, the city meetings. In the past the speed tracking signs are put up but doesn't do much. The homeowners on 50th ave have taken to shouting at speeders (and had some face to face conflicts from that). I have been told on another SeeClickFix request that speed bumps are no longer in the budget however I just read a traffic article on BayNews 9 that speed bumps are getting put in for a neighborhood because of speeding. WHY AREN'T WE GETTING THEM?? Neighbors and myself have reached out to Charlie Crist's office to complain as well. We need attention. The temporary fixes are not solving the issue. There are no sidewalks so the dog owners and kids on bikes have no choice but to share the road with these cars many who are putting our kids in danger. What is it going to take to get someone to look at this issue? This is a major concern and deserves attention.","4689 50th Ave N Saint Petersburg, FL, 33714, USA","0",,,"Mon","Mon","Fri","Fri","1203244","POINT (-82.697753972699 27.817624014717)","90","1","90","true"

It's really time for this place to be closed, but at the very least, be cited and fined for the constant disruptive noise.

Bus Stop shelter 4375 Seriously needs to be monitored and cleaned up. Homeless people, drug users, alcoholics. Someone needs to Monitor this bus shelter as normal citizens cannot use it. There urinating in and behind the shelter, human feces behind the bus shelter, sleeping over night in the shelter. this is unacceptable. The landscaping around the shelter needs to be trimmed and maybe install a light it�s pitch black at night. This is Bus shelter 4375 @ 1277 s Missouri Ave in front of the Shell gas station and Popeyes chicken restaurant. I seen a request was also submitted last year and nothing was ever done. I think it�s time for the newspaper and the media to look into this and what�s being done about this.

His falling/dying trees have damaged my fence beyond repair, there are vines and roots destroying my yard, there's broken glass from aquariums, junk piles and appliances, standing water to allow for mosquitoes to breed.. we cannot enjoy our backyard at night at all between the wild animals coming through and the amount of mosquitoes that they are allowing to breed. This, along with the obvious security issues of homeless/squatters taking over the property, I have found 3 people, one was in my yard looking through my truck and luckily that night I happened to be in a patient mood.
