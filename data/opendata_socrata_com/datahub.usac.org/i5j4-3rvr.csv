FCPL is a large suburban library system in Northern Virginia, serving a population of 1.2 million people over 400 square miles. FCPL has 400,000 cardholders and Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) has 178,000 students. Fairfax County demographics are complex and diverse; 39% or 470,000 of our residents speak a language other than English at home and 34.5% or 61,000 FCPS students participate in the Free and Reduced Lunch Program. 

FCPL is a critical community resource, providing digital tools and access for residents who may not have other options available. We offer 400 public PCs with wired internet access, wifi both inside buildings and in our parking lots, and a small collection of 20 circulating Chromebooks – all free of charge. Our circulating Chromebook collection, launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been extremely popular and demonstrates that our community continues to have unmet needs for internet access. Between February and July 2021, on average 70% of the Chromebooks were checked out at any one time. In July 2021, on average 78% of the Chromebooks were checked out at any one time. 

We are applying for funding for 50 Chromebooks and 50 wireless hotspots to circulate together, as 50 individual kits.  We anticipate that 100% of these kits will have circulated within 30 days of deployment.","17457","0","17457","17457",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","1","2021-09-24T00:00:00.000","The months of service for the funding request was changed from 12 months to 11 months.

FCPL is a large suburban library system in Northern Virginia, serving a population of 1.2 million people over 400 square miles. FCPL has 400,000 cardholders and Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) has 178,000 students. Fairfax County demographics are complex and diverse; 39% or 470,000 of our residents speak a language other than English at home and 34.5% or 61,000 FCPS students participate in the Free and Reduced Lunch Program. 

FCPL is a critical community resource, providing digital tools and access for residents who may not have other options available. We offer 400 public PCs with wired internet access, wifi both inside buildings and in our parking lots, and a small collection of 20 circulating Chromebooks – all free of charge. Our circulating Chromebook collection, launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been extremely popular and demonstrates that our community continues to have unmet needs for internet access. Between February and July 2021, on average 70% of the Chromebooks were checked out at any one time. In July 2021, on average 78% of the Chromebooks were checked out at any one time. 

We are applying for funding for 50 Chromebooks and 50 wireless hotspots to circulate together, as 50 individual kits.  We anticipate that 100% of these kits will have circulated within 30 days of deployment.","17457","0","17457","17457",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","1","2021-09-24T00:00:00.000","The months of service for the funding request was changed from 12 months to 11 months.

FCPL is a large suburban library system in Northern Virginia, serving a population of 1.2 million people over 400 square miles. FCPL has 400,000 cardholders and Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) has 178,000 students. Fairfax County demographics are complex and diverse; 39% or 470,000 of our residents speak a language other than English at home and 34.5% or 61,000 FCPS students participate in the Free and Reduced Lunch Program. 

FCPL is a critical community resource, providing digital tools and access for residents who may not have other options available. We offer 400 public PCs with wired internet access, wifi both inside buildings and in our parking lots, and a small collection of 20 circulating Chromebooks – all free of charge. Our circulating Chromebook collection, launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been extremely popular and demonstrates that our community continues to have unmet needs for internet access. Between February and July 2021, on average 70% of the Chromebooks were checked out at any one time. In July 2021, on average 78% of the Chromebooks were checked out at any one time. 

We are applying for funding for 50 Chromebooks and 50 wireless hotspots to circulate together, as 50 individual kits. We anticipate that 100% of these kits will have circulated within 30 days of deployment.","0","4249.5","4249.5","4249.5",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","1","2021-09-24T00:00:00.000","Approved as submitted.","0","1","Wi-Fi hotspots","Moxee","Mobile",,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","84.99","50","4249.5","4249.5"

These are critical to remote learning for obvious reasons, but each one has specific traits that will be critical to our students' success if we have to return to remote learning.

The laptops we intend to purchase and distribute to our students will be replacing current student devices. The current devices were sufficient for in-school learning, but turned out to be totally insufficient for remote learning. The enhanced processor speed and RAM will enable students to simultaneously run remote learning (Zoom) and whatever educational programs/digital workbooks that they are assigned. Additionally, the new devices have better cameras--something particularly important to the engagement of younger students--and upgraded radio antennas, which allow the devices to take advantage of the higher bandwidth that the routers will be supplying.

The routers will be instrumental in ensuring a smooth connection and appropriate learning environment for the students. The two most common complaints during past remote learning were bad connections to the wifi, and an inability to set up a calm environment that is conducive to learning. The mesh network handles both of these problems. By providing continuous coverage over a large area--and multiple access points so that impenetrable walls can be circumvented--the students can be provided with a strong network that reaches to the quiet corner of their bedroom or study. It became exceedingly clear during remote learning that students learning from the living room or kitchen table--especially when multiple students live in the same home--simply could not focus appropriately; enabling them to have private workspaces will greatly improve their learning capabilities.","0","61160","61160","61160",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","2","2021-10-12T00:00:00.000","The funding request amount for Connected Device was reduced from $429.99 per connected device to $400.00 per connected device to remove the amount that exceeds the cap amount.","46670","1","Laptops","Lenovo","Flex 5",,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","359","130","46670","46670"

Currently, the only device access instructional staff have access to is a designated desktop computer within the school building.  When the pandemic began in March of 2020, it quickly became evident that remote learning from home was impossible for most staff members because they lacked access to a device that was sufficient for online/remote instruction and the school division did not have the devices available, or the financial capability to provide staff with a connected laptop device.  This became a major hurdle throughout the end of the 2019-20 school year, as well as the entirety of the 2020-21 school year as many of our students were on a hybrid or fully virtual learning plan.  

Pittsylvania County Schools proposes to purchase 800 HP Pro c640 Chromebook devices to issue to all instructional staff to ensure continuity of instruction through remote learning and to help close the homework gap for students.  This device not only allows for videoconferencing but will also support all remote learning platforms utilized by our school division.  By providing instructional staff with devices, the division will be able to not only support the continuity of learning and instructional services for students but will also allow teachers to provide after-hours instructional support in helping to close academic gaps for students from loss of learning during the pandemic.

According to 2019 American Community Survey Data provided by the US Census Bureau, the population of the city of Niagara Falls is 47,720 with 28.2% of the population living below the poverty rate.  

US Census Bureau poverty rate statistics are further enforced by the Niagara Falls City School District's participation in the Community Eligibility Provision of the National School Lunch Program.  Niagara Falls City School District's 67.2% identified student percentage (ISP) is far greater than the eligibility threshold of 40% for students who must be “directly certified,” i.e., identified for free meals through means other than household applications (for example, students directly certified as receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). Families receiving SNAP benefits are less likely to have the disposable income necessary to have access to at-home internet access.

Both US Census Bureau data for the city of Niagara Falls and published data for the local school district strongly indicate an environment where households are without access to internet connectivity, regardless of household age. The Niagara Falls Public Libraries procurement of 200 hotspots will help close the digital divide and provide library patrons access to internet connectivity when they otherwise would not have access to it.","68880","0","68880","68880",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","4","2021-11-08T00:00:00.000","Approved as submitted.","0","1",,,,"Mobile Broadband","30","30","No",,,"28.7","200","12","68880","0","0","0","68880"

That rurality creates a transportation barrier for the district and its residents, characterized by the existence of only two (2) major roadways that can provide quick, easy routes throughout the county and beyond. The remaining roads in the county/district are often hilly, windy routes that must be traveled at slower speeds for safety. This results in student travel times in buses of one hour or more for many of the district’s school bus runs, and a bus fleet that travels over 10,000 miles each day bringing students to and from school. 

 

Those same topographies contribute to an ongoing lack of student and family access to sufficient broadband service, if not Internet service in general, in some of our most rural areas.  The pandemic has created more urgency around the issue of access to broadband as local educational agencies (LEA’s) and students continue to confront the very real possibility of school closures and online instruction at the home. One solution to help students have more access to suitable broadband is to install Wi-Fi, delivered via mobile broadband service, in WCSD school buses for use by students during their already long drive times.     

 

The WCSD sent a survey to each of its families at the end of the 2019-2020 school year, when the pandemic began, to provide information on the barriers to online learning present in district homes. Sixty percent (60%) of families responded to the survey and district administrators contacted non-respondents via phone. Those efforts yielded a better than 95% response rate to the survey.     

 

Parents were asked what barriers existed in the home that would keep students from doing online work if schools continued to be closed in the fall.  Parents were able to select multiple items, and among the choices were five items, listed below, related to computers at home and access to the internet at home:    

We do not have a computer 
We do not have enough computers for every child   
We have a computer, but it is too old and slow to do online work   
We don't have the Internet at our house   
We have the Internet, but it is too slow to do online work   
 

Responses to the survey demonstrated that the district had approximately 1109 students who either lacked sufficient broadband access in the home or had no access to Internet service in the home at all. This represents 28% of the total WCSD student population. 

 

With that data, the district is proposing the installation of mobile broadband equipment in the majority of its bus fleet. The proposed equipment will require the use of two separate mobile broadband providers given the large distances covered by district buses, which frequently involve crossing from one carrier coverage area to another. The mobile broadband signal will be converted to Wi-Fi on each bus to support the academic needs of the students during the trip to and from school. Students will then have the ability to read school material, do homework, and other school-related activities to compensate for the barriers that may exist in the home. 

This is the funding request to support the cost of mobile broadband services to each bus.","35207.9","0","35207.9","35207.9",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","4","2021-11-08T00:00:00.000","Approved as Submitted.","0","2",,,,"Taxes and Reasonable Charges","4000","4000","No",,,"4.24","73","10","3095.2","0","0","0","3095.2"

In July 2021, a needs of assessment was administered to the students and teachers of the school, with the purpose of identifying the need for equipment and internet connection in homes. The study was administered using a questionnaire in the Microsoft Form tool. The questionnaire data were tabulated and the results extrapolated, since the number of students who answered only represented 42% (159/376) of the current enrollment and of the employees, only 66% (31/47) answered. However, the extrapolation was minimal and the estimate is quite real. The needs study considered the teaching staff (teachers and support staff) that directly impacts the students. So, in the amounts reported, not only the information of the students is being provided, but also of these employees. In addition, the results were compared with the results of a similar study the school conducted in the summer of 2020 on the school community.","29970","0","29970","29970",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","4","2021-11-08T00:00:00.000","Approved as submitted.","14179.35","1",,,,"Mobile Broadband","50","10","No",,,"49.95","50","12","29970","0","0","0","29970"

We also are requesting hotspots and service for 68 new devices to circulate with laptops and tablets that we plan to purchase with ECF funds and circulate to our patrons. These will be intended primarily for educational purposes.

Warren is located in southeast Michigan and is the third largest city in the state, with a 2020 Census population of 134,797. Warren Public Library has four branches serving Warren and those from surrounding communities, mostly residents of Macomb County, of Oakland County, and of Detroit (which borders Warren). (Unless otherwise indicated, all statistics are from Census.gov.)  Warren is the largest diverse suburb in metro Detroit.  Currently, 17.5 percent of residents live below the poverty level, and 16.2 percent of Warren residents are age 65 and older. In Warren, 38.3 percent of households with residents age 60 or older receive SNAP benefits, 41 percent of households with residents under age 18 receive SNAP benefits, and 55.9 percent of households with residents with disabilities receive SNAP benefits (USDA, 2018 statistics). For Warren's four school districts, the percentage of students who were ""economically disadvantaged"" and eligible for free or reduced-price lunch in fall 2019 ranged from 59.94 to 90.38 percent; for the four charter schools in Warren in fall 2019, the percentage of students who were ""economically disadvantaged"" ranged from 91.47 to 99.77 percent (Center for Educational Performance and Information).","34532.8","0","34532.8","34532.8",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","12","2022-03-23T00:00:00.000","MR1: FRN ECF2190014384 was for both Mobile Broadband and Wi-Fi hotspots and was split to agree with the applicant documentation.

Their devices all met the Google recommended guidelines for large Google Meets and presentations which were required for their remote learning. At the same time, we had 581 PK-5th grade students that needed devices for remote learning.  We were able to provide 23 Dell Latitude 3310 devices to students at the PK level. These devices exceeded Google recommended guidelines for large Google Meets. We provided various model Chromebooks to 558 K-5 students. Unfortunately, these models (Acer/Lenovo N2x) performed poorly during this time with many students experiencing drops and freezes while attempting to join their respective Google Meets. The models indeed did not meet Google's recommendations with such items as 4GB RAM. These devices had only 2GB RAM for example. 
We utilized SQL reporting to show the number of PK-5 students who were assigned these devices (Attached without students' names) This file shows 558 Acer/Lenovo Chromebook assignments that did not meet Google recommendations. These models consistently showed high resource utilization in the mid to upper 90% range as shown in Google Meets Quality Reporting Tool. It is our intent to request a total of 310 devices that we can provide to our PK-5 students so that they will be equipped for remote learning as required. We will be able to repurpose available devices for the remaining 295 PK-5th grade students that will meet, or exceed, Google's Meet recommendations. It is our intent to ensure that these students will be equipped for remote learning as required. We plan on storing these requested devices within our schools and to make them readily available for the corresponding students during the regular school days on campus.

We are requesting hotspot service for 40 hotspots that we currently have for circulation, some for 12 months and some for 10 months since ten of them were purchased with a grant that ends funding on September 30, 2021.  We also are requesting hotspots and service for 68 new devices to circulate with laptops and tablets that we plan to purchase with ECF funds and circulate to our patrons. These will be intended primarily for educational purposes.

Warren is located in southeast Michigan and is the third largest city in the state, with a 2020 Census population of 134,797. Warren Public Library has four branches serving Warren and those from surrounding communities, mostly residents of Macomb County, of Oakland County, and of Detroit (which borders Warren). (Unless otherwise indicated, all statistics are from Census.gov.)  Warren is the largest diverse suburb in metro Detroit.  Currently, 17.5 percent of residents live below the poverty level, and 16.2 percent of Warren residents are age 65 and older. In Warren, 38.3 percent of households with residents age 60 or older receive SNAP benefits, 41 percent of households with residents under age 18 receive SNAP benefits, and 55.9 percent of households with residents with disabilities receive SNAP benefits (USDA, 2018 statistics). For Warren's four school districts, the percentage of students who were ""economically disadvantaged"" and eligible for free or reduced-price lunch in fall 2019 ranged from 59.94 to 90.38 percent; for the four charter schools in Warren in fall 2019, the percentage of students who were ""economically disadvantaged"" ranged from 91.47 to 99.77 percent (Center for Educational Performance and Information).","34532.8","0","34532.8","34532.8",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","12","2022-03-23T00:00:00.000","MR1: FRN ECF2190014384 was for both Mobile Broadband and Wi-Fi hotspots and was split to agree with the applicant documentation.

This will include a 3-year manufactures warranty, Google licenses allowing the library's IT team to manage laptops remotely to ensure patron compliance with our laptop use policies, and ""white glove"" installation services. These laptops will be used as a pilot laptop lending program at 2 of the library's 27 branches in order to close the homework gap and bridge the digital divide in our communities.

THPL seeks to meet the technology access needs of its 1.4 million residents. This project endeavors close the homework gap and bridge the digital divide in our communities through the purchase of 250 circulating laptops that will help library customers connect to the internet and access much-needed resources from home. THPL connects individuals to workforce skills, educational tools, and crucial government resources in a county where 15.3% of residents live below the poverty line. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Hillsborough County saw a low of 2.5% unemployment in December 2019. By March 2020, when Florida’s first case of Covid-19 was reported here in Hillsborough County, the unemployment rate significantly increased to 4.2%, peaking at 12.3% the following month. Local and state orders related to COVID-19 closed most non-essential businesses, all Hillsborough County schools, and many government services, including all 27 library branches. Furthermore, childcare facilities were required to limit their capacity, which added the additional concerns of childcare and at-home schooling for thousands of families which revealed how ill equipped some communities were when faced with online learning. Although public schools have resumed in-person classes, many parents are considering virtual alternatives, and the students who participate in face-to-face instruction also need internet-connected devices to complete their course assignments. According to the Florida Department of Education, 58% of the more than 200,000 Hillsborough County Public School students are economically disadvantaged and may not have the resources to meet their educational needs. These individuals and families need internet-capable devices for job searching and school work, but U.S. Census figures show that a large number of households did not have these services even prior to the loss of income related to COVID-19. 

THPL understands that access to opportunity is dependent upon digital literacy and enables fair access to public technology. Hillsborough County libraries encourage skill development and improve workforce readiness. They serve as active, dynamic community centers that contribute to economically sound communities and provide vital entrepreneur and small business support. Many residents depend on libraries and other government service centers for reliable, free access to the internet and public computers for their personal and professional needs. In fiscal year 2019, patrons accessed library WiFi 3,889,030 times and signed into the library’s public computers 699,336 times. Both figures reflect an increase from the previous year. The Library has a popular, well-established hotspot lending program, and in fiscal year 2019, 120 WiFi hotspots were borrowed 1,224 times for a two-week checkout period. During extended library closures in response to COVID-19, THPL established Park & Surf WiFi Zones in the parking lots of 9 branches in targeted areas of the county, and in June 2020, customers utilized those WiFi zones 90,890 times. This usage level equals more than one-third of the total connections in June 2019.

THPL finds this to be supporting evidence for the establishment of a laptop lending program to address the technology needs of the community which would well compliment the library's existing internet connectivity services like the hotspot lending program and Park & Surf WiFi Zones.","0","56250","56250","56250",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","4","2021-11-08T00:00:00.000","The amount of the funding request was changed from $100,000.00 to $56,250.00 to remove ineligible products: Service Agreement and Chrome Console License.","0","1","Laptops","Hewlett-Packard","Chromebook",,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","225","250","56250","56250"

We are requesting hotspot service for 40 hotspots that we currently have for circulation, some for 12 months and some for 10 months since ten of them were purchased with a grant that ends funding on September 30, 2021.  We also are requesting hotspots and service for 68 new devices to circulate with laptops and tablets that we plan to purchase with ECF funds and circulate to our patrons. These will be intended primarily for educational purposes.

Warren is located in southeast Michigan and is the third largest city in the state, with a 2020 Census population of 134,797.

That rurality creates a transportation barrier for the district and its residents, characterized by the existence of only two (2) major roadways that can provide quick, easy routes throughout the county and beyond. The remaining roads in the county/district are often hilly, windy routes that must be traveled at slower speeds for safety. This results in student travel times in buses of one hour or more for many of the district’s school bus runs, and a bus fleet that travels over 10,000 miles each day bringing students to and from school. 

 

Those same topographies contribute to an ongoing lack of student and family access to sufficient broadband service, if not Internet service in general, in some of our most rural areas.  The pandemic has created more urgency around the issue of access to broadband as local educational agencies (LEA’s) and students continue to confront the very real possibility of school closures and online instruction at the home. One solution to help students have more access to suitable broadband is to install Wi-Fi, delivered via mobile broadband service, in WCSD school buses for use by students during their already long drive times.     

 

The WCSD sent a survey to each of its families at the end of the 2019-2020 school year, when the pandemic began, to provide information on the barriers to online learning present in district homes. Sixty percent (60%) of families responded to the survey and district administrators contacted non-respondents via phone. Those efforts yielded a better than 95% response rate to the survey.     

 

Parents were asked what barriers existed in the home that would keep students from doing online work if schools continued to be closed in the fall.  Parents were able to select multiple items, and among the choices were five items, listed below, related to computers at home and access to the internet at home:    

We do not have a computer 
We do not have enough computers for every child   
We have a computer, but it is too old and slow to do online work   
We don't have the Internet at our house   
We have the Internet, but it is too slow to do online work   
 

Responses to the survey demonstrated that the district had approximately 1109 students who either lacked sufficient broadband access in the home or had no access to Internet service in the home at all. This represents 28% of the total WCSD student population. 

 

With that data, the district is proposing the installation of mobile broadband equipment in the majority of its bus fleet. The proposed equipment will require the use of two separate mobile broadband providers given the large distances covered by district buses, which frequently involve crossing from one carrier coverage area to another. The mobile broadband signal will be converted to Wi-Fi on each bus to support the academic needs of the students during the trip to and from school.

That rurality creates a transportation barrier for the district and its residents, characterized by the existence of only two (2) major roadways that can provide quick, easy routes throughout the county and beyond. The remaining roads in the county/district are often hilly, windy routes that must be traveled at slower speeds for safety. This results in student travel times in buses of one hour or more for many of the district’s school bus runs, and a bus fleet that travels over 10,000 miles each day bringing students to and from school. 

 

Those same topographies contribute to an ongoing lack of student and family access to sufficient broadband service, if not Internet service in general, in some of our most rural areas.  The pandemic has created more urgency around the issue of access to broadband as local educational agencies (LEA’s) and students continue to confront the very real possibility of school closures and online instruction at the home. One solution to help students have more access to suitable broadband is to install Wi-Fi, delivered via mobile broadband service, in WCSD school buses for use by students during their already long drive times.     

 

The WCSD sent a survey to each of its families at the end of the 2019-2020 school year, when the pandemic began, to provide information on the barriers to online learning present in district homes. Sixty percent (60%) of families responded to the survey and district administrators contacted non-respondents via phone. Those efforts yielded a better than 95% response rate to the survey.     

 

Parents were asked what barriers existed in the home that would keep students from doing online work if schools continued to be closed in the fall.  Parents were able to select multiple items, and among the choices were five items, listed below, related to computers at home and access to the internet at home:    

We do not have a computer 
We do not have enough computers for every child   
We have a computer, but it is too old and slow to do online work   
We don't have the Internet at our house   
We have the Internet, but it is too slow to do online work   
 

Responses to the survey demonstrated that the district had approximately 1109 students who either lacked sufficient broadband access in the home or had no access to Internet service in the home at all. This represents 28% of the total WCSD student population. 

 

With that data, the district is proposing the installation of mobile broadband equipment in the majority of its bus fleet. The proposed equipment will require the use of two separate mobile broadband providers given the large distances covered by district buses, which frequently involve crossing from one carrier coverage area to another. The mobile broadband signal will be converted to Wi-Fi on each bus to support the academic needs of the students during the trip to and from school. Students will then have the ability to read school material, do homework, and other school-related activities to compensate for the barriers that may exist in the home.

We will also require google education licenses for each new laptop. Each of our students will need an assigned laptop in order to ensure continuity of learning whether students are learning in person in our classrooms or at home due to pandemic-related closures. A 1:1 student/laptop ratio will also allow our students and teachers to fully utilize learning and assessment platforms, such as Google Classroom and i-Ready.

The worldwide pandemic COVID-19 caused public libraries in the United States to close in March of 2020.  New Jersey libraries were closed by the Governor’s Office by an Executive Order that addressed nonessential services.  It was the experience of Woodbridge Township librarians who remained in place while the libraries were closing down that phones continued to ring with calls from patrons who needed to file unemployment forms online, and register for other essential services that had become accessible only online as vital public service offices closed.  

Woodbridge Public Library seeks to enhance a partnership of library services with food pantries, which were deemed essential, to supply a package of information to the food pantries with library-provided Internet service and a schedule of library staff who can assist or manage the service and informational questions as needed in order to connect newly vulnerable residents as well as food insecure residents with free connectivity to secure social, economic, informational and educational resources.","1148","0","1148","0",,,,,"4","2021-11-08T00:00:00.000","This FRN was canceled in order to change the service type.

We will give the devices to faculty, staff, and students to assure communication, learning, and other community needs are met while at home. This will aid in the learning loss over the last year of this pandemic experience. 

We ordered 300 hotspots last year: Service end date September 2021. We are requesting 350 hotspots from C-Spire and 100 AT&T hotspots to serve the students and staff for 2021-2022 School Year. 
                  Connectivity is a major issue in Clay County, MS. West Point Leadership drove around the entire county to determine what service would be best compatible for our staff and students. The county, outside West Point city limits (the city is barely over 5000 people) had no internet connectivity that would support distance learning. The district decided to distribute hotspots and create local wifi locations throughout the county. AT&T would only serve the Una community, so we purchased 50 of them last year. We are increasing to 100 due to need based on this past year. C-Spire coverage supported the rest of the county, so we ordered 250 C-Spire hotspots. We are increasing to 350 this coming year due to demand.  We have learned that 1-hotspot is good for 2 students during distance learning. Families that have 3-4 students in the home will need to hotspots. Students had to take turns using the hotspot because their zoom sessions would drop. We plan to only assign 1 per household, but this may still be a major issue if there are several students in the home.","62552","0","62552",,,,,,,,,,"1",,,,"Mobile Broadband","100","20","No",,,"22.34","350","8","62552","0","0","0","62552"

We have found an approx. $400 laptop being provided by BYTESPEED out of Moorhead Minnesota.  We have used this company many times over the last 15 years to provide systems for our labs and staff.  We are located in Northwestern MN in a very economically depressed area with the loss of families contributing to the loss of funding for the district.  We accept approx. 30% of our students from the neighboring White Earth Native American Reservation.  By providing all students with the ability to work from home, it will clear up a lot of the issues that became obvious during the pandemic with online training.  Having different models and capabilities of systems throughout the district made it difficult for some families to participate.   We heard many complaints from families that only had 1 computer and all of their kids had to share it.  This also led to problems with kids turning in homework while logged into other family members accounts.  We would appreciate funding for 250 laptops.  We are currently listed at 253 students, but I believe we lost a couple over the pandemic.   We also are requesting the $400 / laptop reimbursement for our staff so they also can work from home when needed.  Most of our staff have desktop computers and had to come into school during the pandemic to use webcams mounted in the ceiling to teach online classes to the students at home.  I have requested funding for 25 laptops for our staff.  The total laptop expense for them is $24,250 ($970.00 each) but I understand that only $400 of that would be reimbursed.  In summary, we are requesting assistance for 250 student laptops and 25 staff laptops.","0","110000","110000","110000",,,"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000","2023-06-30T00:00:00.000","1","2021-09-24T00:00:00.000","MR1: The funding request amount for Connected Devices on Line Item 1 was reduced from $450.00 per connected device to $400.00 per connected device to remove the amount that exceeds the cap amount.MR2: The funding request amount for Connected Devices on Line Item 2 was reduced from $970.00 per connected device to $400.00 per connected device to remove the amount that exceeds the cap amount.","109750","1","Laptops","Bytespeed supported ASUS","BR1100C",,,,,,,"0","0","0","0","400","250","100000","100000"
