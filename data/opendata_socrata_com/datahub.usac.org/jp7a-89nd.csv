There is an RFP document that provides greater detail on the scope of this project. It is important that service providers read the attached document to fully understand this project and prepare a more directed bid.
Notre Dame ACE Academies is seeking proposals for a project to supply and install network equipment at its
eligible locations. Bidders are advised that this project will be contingent upon the successful obtaining of
Category 2 E-Rate funding, and the contract agreement between the district and the successful bidder must
recognize that contingency.
The school system seeks an agreement that allows it to work with the selected vendor to adjust
quantities and/or scale back or cancel the project entirely as needed based upon funding availability
and/or the best interests of the schools. The Applicant seeks bids for equipment purchase and
installation of listed equipment. Service providers may bid on one or both of these services. The
Applicant requests that interested service providers include separate pricing for the equipment and for
the installation services. The Applicant reserves the right to select a single or multiple vendors for these
services to maximize the cost effectiveness for the Applicant.

We prefer Internet Access with bandwidth at 250 Mbps scalable to 2 Gbps with guaranteed throughput to the WAN headend at the Central Office, 300 Tiger Blvd, Lawrenceburg, IN 47025 beginning July 1, 2018.  Provide laddered pricing from 250 Mbps to 2 Gbps in all bids and contracts.
We will require 35 IPv4 addresses.  Please provide individual or block pricing for additional addresses to account for potential growth during the term of the contract.  You may also provide optional pricing for the technical equivalent number of IPv6 addresses.  Your proposal must include any service provider owned onsite equipment necessary to hand off service to the District’s head-end equipment, and you should describe your proposed hand-off as part of your response.  
Each respondent must provide a proposed Service Level Agreement (SLA) with their response (see attached RFP for additional details).

We are seeking 3 year contract options. 3 year contracts should allow for upgrades to quoted bandwidth throughout the terms of the contract.  If an increase in bandwidth is requested during the contract period the contract does not renew. All solutions should include installation and initial configuration, a method to report service outages and receive basic technical support without additional service fees, and a service level agreement.
All solutions can include special construction or one-time E-rate eligible non-recurring costs as well as E-rate eligible recurring circuit costs. Any special construction pricing should be separated from any MRC.  Based on the bids and both a short term and long term cost effectiveness analysis, we will determine which of the solutions is acceptable.  Failure to include any requested information in the previous paragraph is grounds for disqualification.
Prices should be all inclusive. All inclusive in this case means, including all special construction or non-recurring costs (NRC) required by the vendor to commence service and all monthly recurring costs (MRC) should be included. We would prefer the option available under E-rate rules to amortize the non-discounted portion of any special construction costs over four years or the life of the contract, if the contract is shorter than four years.","Red Top Meadows is seeking proposals to replace aging network hardware and internal wiring.

Public work and purchase contracts for public schools in New York State are governed by the procurement provisions of the State's General Municipal Law.
Public schools may also purchase equipment and services under publicly bid centralized procurement contracts administered by the State's Office of General Services (OGS).

To assure full consideration, all bids and/or information requests should be directed to the applicant contact provided in this Form 470 and (a) reference the nine-digit Form 470 number, and (b) be copied via e-mail to Alicia S. King at BidsNY@e-ratecentral.com. This Form 470 is requesting services for FY2019 (July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020) and potentially beyond. The applicant may consider multi-year contracts or contracts with voluntary extensions. All proposed pricing should include all applicable taxes, surcharges, usage fees, etc. and should identify the items that are ineligible for E-rate. Subject to contract restrictions, services may be reevaluated for cost-effectiveness at any time during the year. Bids for services requested, therefore, will be accepted up to 28 days after the posting of next year's Form 470. As required by E-rate rules, all bids in response to this Form 470 must offer the Lowest Corresponding Price (LCP).

As the State of Wyoming continues to improve its technology infrastructure throughout the State, ETS is leading the charge in providing the appropriate level of bandwidth throughout the state.  The State and Education networks have recently been unified in an effort to drive innovation forward in a way that enhances technology use for students and State employees.

Service should be terminated at Yaak School, 29893 Yaak River Rd, Troy, MT 59935.  Pricing should be included for 100Mbps increments from the minimum to the maximum bandwidths noted above.  We are seeking 1 , 3 or 5 year contract options. 3 or 5 year contracts should allow for upgrades to quoted bandwidth throughout the terms of the contract.  If an increase in bandwidth is requested during the contract period the contract does not renew. All solutions should include installation and initial configuration (if needed), a method to report service outages and receive basic technical support without additional service fees, and a service level agreement.

All solutions can include special construction or one-time E-rate eligible non-recurring costs as well as E-rate eligible recurring circuit costs. Based on the bids and both a short term and long term cost effectiveness analysis, we will determine which of the solutions is acceptable.  Failure to include any requested information in the previous paragraph is grounds for disqualification.

Prices should be all-inclusive. All inclusive in this case means, including all special construction or non-recurring costs (NRC) required by the vendor to commence service and all monthly recurring costs (MRC) should be included. We would prefer the option available under E-rate rules to amortize the non-discounted portion of any special construction costs over four years or the life of the contract, if the contract is shorter than four years.

Service implementation for all solutions is dependent on receipt of an E-rate funding commitment letter.  For any solutions requiring special construction, service implementation is also dependent on award of state matching funds from Montana State Matching fund as laid out in HB 390 and Mont. Code Ann. §200-534

Public work and purchase contracts for public schools in New York State are governed by the procurement provisions of the State's General Municipal Law.
Public schools may also purchase equipment and services under publicly bid centralized procurement contracts administered by the State's Office of General Services (OGS).

To assure full consideration, all bids and/or information requests should be directed to the applicant contact provided in this Form 470 and (a) reference the nine-digit Form 470 number, and (b) be copied via e-mail to Alicia S. King at BidsNY@e-ratecentral.com. This Form 470 is requesting services for FY2019 (July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020) and potentially beyond. The applicant may consider multi-year contracts or contracts with voluntary extensions. All proposed pricing should include all applicable taxes, surcharges, usage fees, etc. and should identify the items that are ineligible for E-rate. Subject to contract restrictions, services may be reevaluated for cost-effectiveness at any time during the year. Bids for services requested, therefore, will be accepted up to 28 days after the posting of next year's Form 470. As required by E-rate rules, all bids in response to this Form 470 must offer the Lowest Corresponding Price (LCP).

The District seeks bids for a 2 year, 3 year and 5 year contract options with or without voluntary extensions; other terms will be considered.  All cost proposals must reflect the LCP (Lowest Corresponding Price), GSA pricing, and any available governmental unit discounts including existing state purchasing agreements or contracts.  Any proposal referencing an existing state purchasing agreement or contract must include that information in the proposal.  Bid prices must be complete for the services proposed and shall include all associated costs, even if the amounts are estimates based upon current applicable taxes, surcharges, or fees.
