Chiara brings a detail-oriented focus to every aspect of her projects. She enjoys working with different aesthetics and tailors her designs to create consistently unique environments.  Chiaraâs appreciation for interior design sparked while traveling between New York City and Italy during her childhood. Her first career at Vogue magazine, where she worked as an editor and stylist, allowed Chiara to seamlessly transition to interiors, working at such design firms as Molly Isaksen Interiors, Nickey Kehoe, and Suzanne Rheinstein.  During this time, she gained invaluable experience and exposure to a vast resource of internationally acclaimed craftsmen, artists and dealers.  Whether designing a celebrityâs home in the Hollywood Hills, a polished Upper East Side apartment, a contemporary urban loft, corporate offices in both New York city and Los Angeles, an all womenâs membership club, retail stores or several upscale city restaurants, Chiara de Rege delivers unparalleled service and superior design acumen.  All of her projects share a timeless sensibility brought to life with a mix of modern and traditional furnishings -- many custom-designed for each project. Chiara often goes well beyond the normal scope, by designing custom stationary, linens, amenities, dinnerware, flatware and libraries, and also works extensively on branding concept and design for each of her commercial projects.

The first batches of our hot sauce were born in the heart of Brooklyn, from a recipe passed down through a family of Dominican cooks.  Just like the sauce, Maritza Abreu, the founder of Pisqueya, was born in NYC but has roots in the Caribbean. Her parents came from the Dominican Republic and worked tirelessly to open their restaurant, Puerto Viejo, where Brooklnites could enjoy the flavors of Dominican cuisine, including the familyâs hot sauce recipe. After 22 years of serving delicious food to the neighborhood, the Abreu family lost their restaurant to a fire, taking the hot sauce with it.  A year and a half later, the family banded together to reinvent Puerto Viejo in a changing Brooklyn and were met with open arms by the neighbors who had supported them throughout the years. Maritza noticed, however, that their customers not only missed their food, but the sauce too, and she decided to create Pisqueya to bottle and share their special island flavor beyond the neighborhood.   Martiza now personally oversees the creation of the sauce that loyal customers have been pouring on everything for more than three decades. In the process of bringing Pisqueya to life, she has created two new recipes- a milder take on the original and a tropical spicy sweet twist. All three varieties have a two-year shelf life, are vegan, kosher, gluten and preservative free and low in sodium. Pisqueya believes that quality, authenticity and flavor should never be compromised, and we invite you to share that with us!",,,"Foodtown","2500","100","2018-05-15T00:00:00.000","Provides hot sauce to grocery store","Snack Magic","1400","100","2020-06-25T00:00:00.000","Provide hot sauces for snack boxes","One Hotel","129","100","2019-06-20T00:00:00.000","Providing hot sauce for hotels","Aloft Hotel","2000","100","2018-08-15T00:00:00.000","Provides hot sauce to hotel"

Does stress on job or in your relationship(s) cause overeating? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we will look at how all parts of connected life affect health as a whole.  We work with clients to get in touch with their body's needs because we understand that life happens, and needs will change. We want to equip people with the self-awareness to make the best decisions in any given circumstance. We believe each person is fully capable of making well-informed decisions as their own expert, not the latest magazine article or fad diet book.  We use assessment tools to assist the client to define what they value most. We'll use these visions to motivate specific goals that bring them closer to where they want to be. As a health and wellness coach, we will not dictate a diet, but together we will explore why some foods make you feel better than others and how to strategically use that feedback. Together weÂ¿ll co-create your health goals within reasonable time frames and actionable objectives, so you know exactly what you're working toward.  Clients seek RenewÂ¿d services for several reasons:  Statistics show: Chronic conditions like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are present in our population at unacceptably high and costly levels. More than 78 million American adults are obese, and more than 1 in 20 is extremely obese. About 70 million U.S. adults have hypertension with only 52 percent having the condition under control. Just over 29 million Americans have diabetes and an additional 86 million have prediabetes. The medical costs of these conditions are staggering Â¿ an estimated yearly total of $147 billion for obesity, $42 billion for hypertension, and $245 billion for diabetes.     One of the successful and under-utilized remedies for this these conditions is behavior change in the form of dietary and/or activity modifications.

We are obsessed with winning, and aggressively advocate for our clients through rigorous analysis balanced against commercial, political and strategic realities.  We put our clientsâ interests first. We set clear goals at the outset of an engagement and work with clients to define âsuccessâ and then deploy resources efficiently and innovatively to minimize disruption to their businesses. We offer pre-litigation counseling and advice and seek a consensual resolution, if appropriate. From the outset of each engagement, however, we prepare as if the investigation or dispute will be resolved in an adversarial proceeding before a court, a regulatory proceeding, or an arbitration panel. We train our sights on the critical facts and issues that matter most to our clients at trial rather than pre-trial machinations to gain leverage.  Select Practice Areas: - Insolvency and Creditorâs Rights. Our attorneys have represented creditors in Chapter 11 proceedings, including lenders, bondholders, trade creditors and equity holders; helped distressed companies sell assets; defended creditors in fraudulent conveyance and preferential transfers actions; and investigated breach of fiduciary duty and fraud claims, as well as subordination of claims and priority disputes. - Investigations and Government Enforcement Defense. We have deep experience representing clients in civil proceedings before federal, state and city regulatory agencies on a range of issues including antitrust, accounting restatements, fraud, and FCPA matters. - Securities Enforcement & Regulatory. Our lawyers leverage their experience at federal and state regulatory agencies to advise clients about financial products and services litigation that accompany industrywide inquiries. - Trials, Arbitrations and Mediation. Our lawyers have extensive litigation experience in state and federal courts nationwide. - Employment Counseling and Litigation. We have led internal investigations, defended claims of discrimination, sexual harassment and wrongful termination, and prepared severance agreements for clients. We also provide guidance on talent management strategies designed to mitigate risk. - Risk and Crisis Management. Our attorneys focus on risk and crisis management to mitigate litigation and reputational risk.

With pride in our quality of service, we have carefully selected our team of passionate Nail Bae's that are committed to providing only the best quality service.  Vanity Beauty Bar is a full-service nail salon which was originally formed in 2017. We had dreams of becoming business owners and to begin our path of entrepreneurship. However, those dreams were halted due to circumstances beyond our control. In May of 2017, just days before our initial grand opening date, we were sidelined by a fire that began in the cellar, which quickly spread upward from the basement and into the salon. The fire led to several other barriers along the way. We have always put our trust in God and believe that everything truly happens for a reason.   Fast forward to the present, after several years of patiently waiting, and finally receiving clearance from the City to occupy the space were were impacted once again, due to the corona-virus pandemic.   As most restrictions have now been lifted. Vanity Beauty Bar Brooklyn is finally ready to reach new milestones and achievements, in conjunction with all safety and health guidelines implemented by the State of New York.  It has been a rough, long and hard-fought journey with a lot of lessons learned throughout the process. We are delighted to begin service the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
