While unemployment both nationally and in the Bronx has hit record lows (4.4 percent and 5.7 percent) respectively, the residents of Community Districts Four are still contending with this issue.  Unemployment in Community District Four is slightly higher at 6.8 percent. While the number has consistently gone done we must continue to create jobs and economic opportunities for area residents.   It should also be noted these numbers do not account for the tens of thousands of residents who are underemployed.

The employment programs leave behind the one-size-fits-all approach of the past to offer services that take into account individual needs of HRA clients while providing specialized services for youth, individuals with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), and other groups with specific needs.

"20180426","2","06","16","206201916E","Other NYPD staff resources requests","Sufficient resources are requested to restore NYPD bicycle patrols. Bicycle patrols provide a low-cost option for policing that combines the best elements of vehicular access with flexible patrol routes. With increased bicycling, and the call for better enforcement of bicycling rules, it would also provide a more convenient way for police to engage other bicyclists in the proper education and enforcement of the rules of the road. Previous bicycle patrols involved the use of vouchered and donated bicycles making this a cost-effective program that should be reinstituted.","OMB supports the agency's position as follows: Additional NYPD resources for this project are unavailable at this time due to funding constraints. However, the program will continue to operate within current funding levels.","OMB","Police Department","78th Precinct Community Council",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
