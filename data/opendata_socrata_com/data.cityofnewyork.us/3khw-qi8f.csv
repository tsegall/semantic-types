Only one manufacturer will be selected for contract award by DSNY pursuant to this solicitation. DSNY currently has 23,000 litter baskets citywide, including over 13,000 wire litter baskets.</p><p>These baskets are easy for residents to misuse, accessible to rats, and often overflowing. Group Project, a local design team, prototyped the litter basket of the future: rat resistant, harder for residents and business to misuse, easier for Sanitation Workers to use, and with more volume. The selected manufacturer will be working with DSNY and Group Project to produce Better Bins. One key innovation drove the design both functionally and aestheticallya modular, three-part construction. The receptacle consists of a stand, lid, and recyclable plastic basket. The stand, which stays on the street corner, serves as a home base to anchor and protect the basket. Its designed to withstand heavy winds and the wear-and-tear of NYC streets. Perforations allow for visual inspection. A bisected lid serves three purposes. First, its a hinge that opens the lid for the removal of the basket. Second, it keeps refuse in and bulky or household waste out. Third, it improves upon the current premium baskets design, because there are not side access doors which invite rodents and need to be shoveled out after snowstorms. The plastic basket is less than half the weight of the current green wire mesh receptacle. This reduction in weight lightens a Sanitation Workers load. Additional handles at vital touch points on the basket improve ergonomics and flexibility in use.</p><p>A modular design allows DSNY to replace the most abused part, the basket, before it must replace the entire receptacle, thereby lowering the overall cost. Better Bin is better  for New Yorkers, for Sanitation Workers, and for the City.</p>",,,"Pre bid conference location -WebEx Pre-Proposal Conference   New York NY 10004 Mandatory: no Date/Time - 2022-08-09 11:00:00",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND:</p><p>The New York City School Construction Authority (SCA) is seeking qualified consulting (Consultant) firms interested in responding to an Expression of Interest (EOI) to provide the SCAs Architecture & Engineering Department with cost estimating services for school construction projects throughout the New York City area in connection with its General Construction, HVAC, Plumbing and Electrical work. This EOI is intended to not only identify interested firms that meet the SCAs required expertise and experience to perform construction cost-estimating services for projects, but to also demonstrate their ability to provide such cost estimates for such construction projects by applying industry rates, units and standards to sample mock projects that are typical within the SCA.</p><p>II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</p><p>The standard course-of-work for estimating services at the SCA for any selected Consultant may involve reviewing the drawings and specifications and preparing detailed independent cost estimates for various capital projects (new and renovation/modernization projects) at all prescribed stages of a project. The Consultant may also be required to review and comment on cost estimates prepared by another consultant of the SCA.</p><p>When reviewing estimates, the Consultant will also be asked to notify the SCA of any omissions or discrepancies that may impede accurate estimating or bidding.</p><p>The Consultant may also be required to perform special cost analyses or cost studies and recommend cost reduction measures to control project costs.</p><p>III. MOCK PROJECT METHODOLOGY:</p><p>Attached are two sample projects typical of work performed at the SCA (Exhibit A and B). You are asked to apply your assessed cost estimating values to each project using industry standards in both principles and format.</p><p>In preparation of the mock project estimates, it is assumed that all project labor costs follow current New York City construction prevailing wage rates and benefits and, all material costs are based on current market conditions.</p><p>IV. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p><p><u>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EOI). THE SCA WLL NOT AWARD A CONTRACT(S) BASED ON THIS EOI NOR PAY FOR INFORMATION SOLICITED</u>.</p><p>The SCA is implementing a two-step procurement process, first requiring prospective consultants to share relevant information as set forth above and then, for those deemed qualified, by soliciting proposals through a Request for Proposal (RFP) selection process. Although proposing firms need not be pre-qualified by the SCA at the time of bid, each firm must be pre-qualified prior to contract award.</p><p>Firms must be registered with the NYS Division of Corporations as a NY entity, or qualified to transact business in the State of New York in order to be considered for prequalification by the SCA. Selected firms will be required to successfully complete the prequalification process, if not currently prequalified with the SCA. The SCA now offers a web-based qualification and certification application process. The following link will allow you access to the Vendor Access System: https://dobusiness.nycsca.org. This site can be used for first-time prequalification as well as requalification and certification of MBE and WBE status. Proposers can also contact the SCA VAS hotline at 718-472-8777 for additional information.</p><p>Interested firms should respond by submitting their completed mock prototypes and expression of interest no later than September 6, Â 2022 to: Martina Mercaldo, Manager of Operations New York City School Construction Authority 30-30 Thomson Avenue Long Island City, NY 11101,Â PARTNERING@nycsca.org</p>",,,,,,,,,,,"https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Current&amp;RequestID=20220817118&amp;DocumentID=176213,https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Current&amp;RequestID=20220817118&amp;DocumentID=176214",,,,,,,

The selected operator must be able to operate, renovate, and maintain the facility as a high-quality restaurant, snack bar and rowboat rental amenity for the public. The selected operator must also act in good faith to seek to accommodate any events booked with the current concessionaire.</p><p>The concession will have a term not to exceed ten (10) years. The concession will be operated pursuant to a license issued by Parks; no leasehold or other proprietary right will be offered. The concession is projected to commence around Spring/Summer 2023 and will expire no more than 10 years from the commencement date. As compensation to the City, Parks anticipates receiving a license fee, expressed as the greater of a guaranteed annual minimum fee versus a percentage of gross receipts.</p><p>At this time, it is neither practicable nor advantageous to award this concession by competitive sealed proposals or competitive sealed bids due to the existence of a time-sensitive situation as the existing concessionaire repudiated its concession agreement by notice dated July 14, 2022, in which it announced the closure of the concession effective as of October 16, 2022. The concession must be awarded quickly, or the facility will remain vacant and significant revenues lost. Delay in placing a new operator will not only be a loss for the public in their use of the restaurant, event space, and boat rental, it will also require Parks to expend significant resources to maintain and secure this facility in Central Park, including but not limited to performing routine maintenance on the electrical and plumbing systems, ensuring proper pest control, and monitoring the facility so it is not damaged. Absent a negotiated concession, this facility, in the most visited city park in the country, will be closed, service to the public will be interrupted, and significant concession revenue will be lost by the City (the timeframe for an award via competitive sealed proposals or competitive sealed bids for this concession would be more than a year from solicitation to award). For reference, the gross receipts reported for this concession in operating year 2021 were $13,143,764.91. For all of these reasons, it is in the best interest of the City to pursue a negotiated concession for this facility.</p><p>Potential concessionaires that would like to express interest in the proposed concession and/or obtain additional information concerning the concession may contact Andrew Coppola, Senior Project Manager for the Revenue Division, at (212) 360-3454 or via e-mail at Andrew.Coppola@parks.nyc.gov by August 19, 2022. Thereafter, there will be a process for submission of proposals. Parks will evaluate the proposals on the bases of capital investment, improvement and designs; operating experience; financial capability; planned operations; and fee offer. Where applicable, Parks may condition the award of this concession upon the successful completion of PASSPort (the Procurement and Sourcing Solutions Portal) Questionnaires and review of that information by the Department of Investigation. In addition, any person or entity with at least a 10% ownership interest in the submitting vendor (including a parent company), may be required to complete PASSPort Questionnaires (Principal Questionnaire for any person and Vendor Questionnaire for any entity with at least a 10% ownership interest in the submitting vendor).</p><p>This concession has been determined not to be a major concession as defined by Chapter 7 of the Rules of the City Planning Commission.</p><p>Please note that the concession award is subject to applicable provisions of federal, State, and local laws and executive orders requiring affirmative action and equal employment opportunity.</p><p>The New York City Comptroller is charged with the audit of concession agreements in New York City. Any person or entity who believes that there has been unfairness, favoritism or impropriety in the proposal process should inform the Comptroller, Office of Contract Administration, 1 Centre Street, New York, New York 10007, telephone number (212) 669-2323.</p><p>Please address any questions and/or correspondence relating to the potential concession award to Andrew Coppola, Senior Project Manager for the Revenue Division, at (212) 360-3454 or via e-mail at Andrew.Coppola@parks.nyc.gov (Office of the Revenue Division, City of New York Parks, The Arsenal-Central Park 830 Fifth Avenue- Room 407 New York, New York 10065).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Test-to-treat allows for testing, clinical review, and dissemination of anti-viral medication all at one location. We seek to establish a roster of vendors with operational expectations, cost structures, and reporting obligations that can provide test-to-treat throughout the city. Vendors must be prepared to deploy teams across many locations, providing all their own supplies, staffing, technology, and logistical support. NYC Health + Hospitals is soliciting proposals for vendors to provide COVID-19 testing with the capability to prescribe therapeutics on-site coupled with the capability for therapeutic distribution through two modalities:</p><p>1. Fixed-sites: Teams able to conduct indoor testing and therapeutic distribution throughout the year, including in the winter months, in locations including but not limited to libraries, congregate care settings, and other community settings where the test location can remain fixed for the duration of a designated surge. For fixed-site testing, NYC Health + Hospitals and the vendor will coordinate on identifying test-to-treat locations while NYC Health + Hospitals will assign vendors to locations for mobile testing and treatment.</p><p>2. Mobile sites: Teams able to conduct outdoor or indoor testing coupled with therapeutic distribution throughout the year, including in the winter months, in locations including but not limited to sidewalks, public parks, private residences, congregate care settings, and other community settings where the test location can be set up and taken down daily. Steady State Deployments: To mitigate the potential need for large scale, resource-intensive surge response work, we seek to maintain a baseline of approx. 30 test-to-treat units operating daily for the duration of this agreement.</p><p>Some of those units should be able to offer both rapid antigen tests, as well as PCR tests. Surge Deployments: Should a surge occur, contracts will have firm commitments outlining the number of test-to-treat units/locations each vendor can scale up to and on what timeline. Additional test-only units may also be activated under a separate contract to supplement these surge test-to-treat units. In the event of a surge, vendors must be ready and able to scale up with initial units being deployed within 5 days of activation and remain activated for 30 days or longer. In the event of a surge activation, the vendor must be capable to quickly scale up to contribute fixed or mobile sites.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,"https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Archived&amp;RequestID=20220715120&amp;DocumentID=175922,https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Archived&amp;RequestID=20220715120&amp;DocumentID=175923,https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Archived&amp;RequestID=20220715120&amp;DocumentID=175924,https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Archived&amp;RequestID=20220715120&amp;DocumentID=175925,https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Archived&amp;RequestID=20220715120&amp;DocumentID=175926,https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/Search/GetFile?SectionID=6&amp;RequestStatus=Archived&amp;RequestID=20220715120&amp;DocumentID=175927",,,,,,,

Introduction</strong></p><p>Â NYCHA is seeking expressions of interest from housing relocation services providers to performing as a consultant to NYCHA onÂ  Â  Â  Â behalf of its Comprehensive Modernization (Comp Mod) program.</p><p>As North Americas largest public housing authority, NYCHA owns more than 177,000 housing apartments in over 2,000 buildings across 326 developments throughout New York Citys five boroughs. These developments presently require more than $40 billion in capital investment due to decades of insufficient funding and deferred maintenance. However, under the 2019 agreement between NYCHA, HUD, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the City of New York (https://nychamonitor.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/03/Final-Executed-NYCHA-Agreement.pdf ), the City has committed a total of $2.2 billion in funding over the next ten years for capital improvements addressing five key areas: Mold, Lead, Elevators, Pest/Waste, and Heating.</p><p>NYCHAs Comp Mod program has been launched to get the most value out of this new funding, which supplements NYCHAs existing capital programs that focus primarily on addressing urgent repairs and replacements of building systems and components. Going beyond repair and maintenance, the Comp Mod program will approach each development holistically to improve building performance for the long term, enhance residents quality of life with improved living conditions, and preserve public housing for current and future residents. The Comp Mod program supplements NYCHAs existing capital programs which focus on addressing urgent repair, replacement and upgrade of specific site and building systems and components.</p><p>NYCHA is in the planning and early procurement stages of securing contractors for the first developments to be renovated under the Comp Mod program.</p><p><strong>2) Tenant Relocation Services</strong></p><p>A major component of the success of the Comp Mod program is a well-coordinated effort to temporarily relocate tenants from their apartments while certain work is being done. Relocations may be required on a full building-by-building or a building wing-by-wing basis and will be phased to coordinate with construction schedules. A relocation consultant will be required to maintain close coordination and communication with NYCHAs tenants, property management, tenant associations, and the future contractor teams.</p><p><strong>3)Â Respondent Questions</strong></p><p>Questions about this RFEI may be submitted in writing to <strong>CompMod@nycha.nyc.gov</strong>, no later than the RFEI Question Deadline. Questions must include the submitters firm name, address, telephone number and the name, title and email address of an individual contact. <strong>Emails should reference the RFEI # 380902 - Comp Mod Tenant Temporary Relocations Services in the subject line</strong>.</p><p><strong>4) Response Format and Submission Requirements</strong></p><p>Submission via iSupplier  Respondent shall electronically upload a single compressed zipped (.zip) file containing its RFEIÂ  Â  response into iSupplier. The .zip file may not exceed 4GB and must contain one Portable Document Format (PDF) documentÂ  Â  containing the complete RFI Response.</p><p>Note: After a Respondent registers for iSupplier, it typically takes 24 to 72 hours for Respondents iSupplier profile to be approved.

This Notice of Intent is being released to inform proposers of the forthcoming Request for Proposals (RFP) and encourage proposers to partner with other vendors if needed in order to provide employment opportunities for NYCHA residents. NYCHA intends to release a RFP in early 2022 to procure landscaping services for grounds restoration at certain NYCHA developments. Significant portions of existing open spaces at these sites were impacted due to the construction activities associated with FEMA funded scope of work for NYCHAs $3 billion Sandy Recovery Program and will require tree planting and other landscaping services as construction is completed. The RFP will be of the IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) type and will allow NYCHA to select one or more vendors to provide landscaping services on a contract basis for a site or group of sites within New York City.</p><p>The following information provides background information for the intended RFP as well as high level view of the Scope of Services. Included within this notice is a timeline to enable appropriate planning by the vendor community. The purpose of this notice is to provide early awareness of this impending RFP in our effort to encourage NYCHA resident employment and fair competition for this procurement.

This 10-year plan will bring $24 billion in vital repairs to New York Citys aging public housing and ensure residents have the safe, decent, and affordable homes they deserve. An important strategy outlined in the NYCHA 2.0 plan is to leverage programs of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to preserve existing public housing stock via NYCHAs preservation initiative called PACT  Permanent Affordability Commitment Together. As such, NYCHA is seeking applications outlining the qualifications of applicants ability to finance, rehabilitate, facilitate property management, and provide social services delivery to support the conversion of developments from the public housing program under Section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended, to a voucher platform under Section 8 of the Act pursuant to RAD and the Section 18 and Part 200 disposition process.</p><p>This Request for Qualifications (RFQ) enables NYCHA to continue to streamline the PACT procurement process by creating a pre-qualified list of potential partners for forthcoming PACT conversions. Developers, property managers, general contractors, and social service providers are welcomed and encouraged to apply as stand-alone entities. Developer, general contractor, property manager, and social service provider applicants must submit qualifying materials by February 17, 2022. Developer, general contractors, property manager, and social service provider applicants will be notified on March 3, 2022 if they meet the required thresholds to qualify for NYCHAs pre-qualified list of partners. The list of developer, general contractor, property manager, and social service provider pre-qualified partners will be made available to the public on March 4, 2022. To remain prequalified, existing PACT partners must submit a revised questionnaire to NYCHA as detailed within the RFQ.</p><p>The Pre-Submission Conference for entities that are not social service providers will be held virtually January 25, 2022 at 10:00 A.M. The Pre-Submission Conference for social service provider entities will be held virtually January 27, 2022 at 10:00 A.M.

Organizations across the city are on the front lines  along with their volunteers  supporting residents in a multitude of ways. NYC Civic Impact funding helps organizations strategically leverage volunteers to deliver essential services, as well as strengthen community engagement and support at a time when it is desperately needed. Food access continues to be a particularly high need area, so this funding will focus support on food supplying and/or serving organizations. 1. Requirements & Priorities: NYC Civic Impact Funding is open to all community-based organizations and nonprofits who are currently engaging volunteers to deliver services to communities. In particular, organizations must be engaging volunteers to improve communities access to healthy and culturally appropriate food. In order to be eligible to apply, an organization must:  Be community-based (e.g. serving particular neighborhood(s) in the five boroughs, with genuine relationships with community stakeholders and residents.  Be a current 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization or have a fiscal sponsor.  Use funding exclusively to support NYC-based volunteer and civic engagement efforts related to increasing access to food and addressing other residual impacts from COVID-19 in high need communities. Organizations that also operate outside of NYC are eligible to apply, but must use this funding for their NYC programming.  Seek to improve their volunteer management practices and have the ability to run an effective volunteer program designed to deliver critical services (e.g. volunteer food distribution, meal preparation, logistical support, tracking data).  Supply and/or serve food. Funding may be used to support other COVID-19 response efforts that utilize volunteers, but volunteer-supported food distribution must be a primary component of the programs funded.  Use funding to provide services to residents in one or more Racial Inclusion & Equity Taskforce Priority Neighborhoods (a list of these neighborhoods can be found online here and is provided after Question #15 in this application). 2. Solicitation/Selection: Request for Quote (RFQ) will be release to qualified providers via Passport. The Applicant may qualify for one-time funding of up to $10,000 which must be used by June 30, 2022. Up to $200,000 in total, up to $10,000 each, will be awarded to approximately 20 organizations. A successful application will demonstrate that funding will be used to support the implementation, improvement, or expansion of volunteer efforts who help deliver essential services to residents throughout New York City. 3. Basis for Contract Award: The contract will be awarded to the highest technically ranked applicant(s) whose price proposal is determined to be fair and reasonable and is determined to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into consideration the price and such other factors or criteria set forth in the RFA. B. FAIR AND REASONABLE The Office of the Mayor will award up to $10,000, each, to twenty (20) applicants. The cost is Federal funds. The same award amount was allocated to applicants during Fiscal Year 2020 and 2021; the cost is comparable to the market-price for similar services; therefore, the ACCO has determined the offered price is fair and reasonable.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the New York City data environment will meet the emerging data needs of the NYC CoC and DSS that expand beyond the minimum requirements of HMIS. NYC CoC and DSS have taken this procurement opportunity to transform and modernize the data system that will meet the emerging and evolving needs of NYC CoC, DSS, and various other stakeholders. The current NYC CoC data system has been in place for more than 15 years and does not meet the current data needs of NYC CoC or DSS. In the past 15 years, the strategic use of HMIS data has increased significantly, but the NYC CoC data system has not been re-envisioned to keep pace with the changing need for data. First the data environment must be compliant with HUD HMIS minimum requirements. The HMIS is designed to capture client-level information over time on the characteristics and service needs of individuals at-risk of and experiencing homelessness. In response to a Congressional directive, HUD has required all Continua of Care across the country to implement an HMIS. The primary goal of the HMIS is to better understand the scope and dimensions of homelessness locally and nationally in order to address homelessness more effectively. Through the implementation of advanced technology, the HMIS also directly benefits service providers and homeless clients by providing more efficient and coordinated services. The HMIS is a valuable resource because of the capacity to integrate and de-duplicate data from all homeless assistance and homelessness prevention programs within the CoC. Aggregate HMIS data can be used to understand the size, characteristics, and needs of the homeless population at the local, state, and national levels. The HMIS enables organizations that operate homeless assistance and homelessness prevention programs to improve case management by collecting information about client needs, goals, and service outcomes. Since inception of HMIS, the data system has matured into a complex data collection and reporting tool utilized by homeless service providers across NYC CoC. HUD published the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) Data and Technical Standards Final Notice on July 30, 2004. The final notice describes the types of data that HUD funded providers must collect from clients receiving homeless assistance services. The notice also presents privacy and security standards for providers, CoC and all other entities that use or process HMIS data. These data standards were revised in October 2014, September 2015, June 2016, October 2017, October 2019, and June 2020. The FY 2020 HMIS Data Standards Manual can be found at the following link: https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Standards-Manual.pdf.</p><p><u><strong>Proposed Term of the Contract(s):</strong> </u>It is anticipated that the terms of the contract(s) awarded from this RFP will be for approximately 3 years. The contract may include an option to renew, for up to 3 years, contingent on additional funding. DHS reserves the right, prior to contract award, to determine the length of the initial contract term and each option to renew, if any.</p><p><strong><u>Procurement Timeline:</u>Â </strong>DHS anticipates that the RFP will be released in 11/2021.

The work will entail evaluating past GreeNYC campaigns; reviewing updated marketing research on New Yorkers views on sustainability and climate change; prioritizing and segmenting City audiences for specific campaigns and messages; evaluating and identifying influential partners for greater reach and impact; and conceive and help execute creative campaign concepts that work across multiple channels. The integrated marketing strategy and program should focus on digital communications and be inclusive of out-of-home, earned media, influencer engagement, and event planning.</p><p>Since its inception in 2007, GreeNYC has used a data-driven approach to inform its outreach efforts to engage New Yorkers in voluntary behavior change to help realize policy goals or fill in gaps created by absent or recently initiated policies.
