ON NOVEMBER 12, 2001: AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 587 DEPARTED JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT EN / ROUTE TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. AT 9:16 AM, SECONDS AFTER TAKE OFF, THE JET CRASHED INTO / THE COMMUNITY OF BELLE HARBOR KILLING ALL 260 PASSENGERS AND CREW AND FIVE BELLE HARBOR / RESIDENTS. PEOPLE FROM FRANCE, HAITI, ISRAEL, TAIWAN, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THE UNITED / STATES AND PUERTO RICO WERE ON THE FLIGHT YET THE MAJORITY WERE OF DOMINICAN DESCENT / TRAVELING TO THEIR HOMELAND OR RETURNING FROM VISITING FAMILY. THE PLANE STRUCK THE / GROUND AT THE INTERSECTION OF BEACH 131ST STREET AND NEWPORT AVENUE WHERE MEMBERS OF THE / FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS (MANY OF THEM OFF DUTY) AND NUMEROUS VOLUNTEERS RUSHED / TO THE SCENE. DESPITE THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS, THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587 STANDS TO DATE AS THE / SECOND LARGEST AVIATION TRAGEDY IN U.S. HISTORY. ALL NEW YORKERS WERE DEVASTATED BY THIS / TERRIBLE EVENT, OCCURRING ONLY TWO MONTHS AND A DAY AFTER THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACK. / THE COMMUNITIES OF WASHINGTON HEIGHTS AND BELLE HARBOR WERE UNIQUELY AFFECTED. MANY OF / THE PASSENGERS LIVED IN AND AROUND WASHINGTON HEIGHTS. BELLE HARBOR WAS HOME TO MANY / POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ON 9/11. THESE COMMUNITIES, TOGETHER / WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND THE CITY OF NEW YORK HAVE CREATED THIS MONUMENT TO / HONOR THOSE WHO PERISHED AND ENSURE THAT WE NEVER FORGET THOSE WE HAVE LOVED AND LOST. /

EL 12 DE NOVIEMBRE DEL 2001, EL VUELO 587 DE AMERICAN AIRLINES PARTIÓ DEL AEROPUERTO / INTERNACIONAL JFK CON DESTINO A LA REPÚBLICA DOMINICANA. A LAS 9:16 AM, EL AVIÓN SE ESTRELLÓ / EN LA COMUNIDAD DE BELLE HARBOR, DONDE PERECIERON LOS 260 PASAJEROS Y TRIPULACIÓN, Y / CINCO RESIDENTES LOCALES. PERSONAS DE FRANCIA, HAITÍ, ISRAEL, TAIWÁN, EL REINO UNIDO, Y LOS / ESTADOS UNIDOS Y PUERTO RICO SE ENCONTRABAN A BORDO. SIN EMBARGO, LA MAYORÍA ERAN DE / ORIGEN DOMINICANO Y VIAJABAN A SU TIERRA O REGRESABAN A ELLA LUEGO DE HABER VISITADO A / FAMILIARES. EL AVIÓN SE ESTRELLÓ EN LA INTERSECCIÓN DE LA CALLE BEACH 131 Y LA AVENIDA / NEWPORT, DONDE MIEMBROS DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE BOMBEROS Y DE LA POLICÍA (MUCHOS DE ELLOS / LIBRE DE SERVICIO), Y NUMEROSOS VOLUNTARIOS ACUDIERON AL LUGAR DEL ACCIDENTE. A PESAR DE / SU HEROICO ESFUERZO, LA CAÍDA DEL VUELO 587 ES HASTA HOY LA SEGUNDA MAYOR TRAGEDIA DE / AVIACIÓN EN LA HISTORIA DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS. TODOS LOS NEOYORQUINOS SE SINTIERON / DEVASTADOS ANTE ESTE TERRIBLE SUCESO OCURRIDO SÓLO DOS MESES Y UN DÍA DESPUÉS DEL ATAQUE / AL WORLD TRADE CENTER. LAS COMUNIDADES DE WASHINGTON HEIGHTS Y BELLE HARBOR FUERON LAS / MÁS AFECTADAS. MUCHOS DE LOS PASAJEROS VIVÍAN EN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS O SUS ALREDEDORES. / BELLE HARBOR ERA EL HOGAR DE MUCHOS AGENTES DE POLICÍA Y BOMBEROS QUE PERDIERON SUS / VIDAS EN EL 11 DE SEPTIEMBRE.
