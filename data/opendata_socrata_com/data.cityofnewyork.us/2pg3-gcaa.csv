DESPITE THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS, THE CRASH OF FLIGHT 587 STANDS TO DATE AS THE / SECOND LARGEST AVIATION TRAGEDY IN U.S. HISTORY. ALL NEW YORKERS WERE DEVASTATED BY THIS / TERRIBLE EVENT, OCCURRING ONLY TWO MONTHS AND A DAY AFTER THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACK. / THE COMMUNITIES OF WASHINGTON HEIGHTS AND BELLE HARBOR WERE UNIQUELY AFFECTED. MANY OF / THE PASSENGERS LIVED IN AND AROUND WASHINGTON HEIGHTS. BELLE HARBOR WAS HOME TO MANY / POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ON 9/11. THESE COMMUNITIES, TOGETHER / WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND THE CITY OF NEW YORK HAVE CREATED THIS MONUMENT TO / HONOR THOSE WHO PERISHED AND ENSURE THAT WE NEVER FORGET THOSE WE HAVE LOVED AND LOST. /
