Neighborhood data are based on zip code of residence for NYC residents only who were discharged from a hospital located in NYC. Crash locations are not available in these data. Visits to emergency departments and hospital stays reflect injuries that require immediate medical treatment. Minor injuries not treated at a hospital are not captured through emergency department and hospitalization data. Data were obtained from the New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). Transportation-related injuries are defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and were recently revised.  The revisions largely pertain to injury-related diagnostic codes including those that capture transportation-related injuries, allowing for better diagnosis. The Centers for Disease Control and national epidemiologists provided guidance to DOHMH for enumerating new injury codes. Because the two ICD systems differ in how they classify injuries, current data and previously posted data are not comparable.  Data prior to 2016 are not shown because they use the older coding ICD-CM schema","Biennially","2021-06-30T00:00:00.000","2022-12-31T00:00:00.000","Scheduled for release",,,,"The release of this dataset is delayed due to impact of COVID-19 activities on staff and available resources.","Y"

The Commissioner has determined that these titles, also known as ""Investigation before Appointment"" (IBA) titles, meet those conditions and are exempt from the prohibition pursuant to the section 8-107(11-a)(f)(2).

CPRR is the repository for the collection of payments made to the City. These payments span across many areas of collection (i.e., parking tickets, property taxes, ECB violations, elevator repairs, FDNY charges, HPD charges, Sanitation charges, DEP charges, etc.). Some data is tax secret and/or private, while other data is already posted onto the Open Data portal (see parking summons data set and property tax dataset). Further, DOF is not the custodial agency for the majority of the payments collected. We do not have any knowledge of why the payment is being collected, the calculations used to arrive at those payment amounts, any penalties assessed, miscellaneous fees, etc. This data comes from the system of record for these payments, not CPRR. For example, STARS is the system of record for parking summons fees. CPRR is responsible for collecting the payment, but has no understanding of the underlying data attached to that payment. STARS data regarding the payment is already distilled and provided within our parking data sets currently on the OD portal. In the alternative, lets say a request is received by DOF regarding elevator charges attached to a property tax bill. DOF is unable to provide any knowledge or understanding as to the nature of that charge. We are only provided with the amount owed by the charging agency. The requestor is referred to DOB for explanation as to the charge and the resulting amount. It is our recommendation that each system of record be responsible for the data surrounding payments and not CPRR. Each agency should have the right to determine what data they provide to the public.",

For example, when vintage 2016 population estimates become available, EpiQuery updates 2014 and 2015 rates. As a result, rates change for historical years, creating discrepancies between Open Data and current EpiQuery.  The program requests that the Open Data module remains fully consistent with the EpiQuery module. However, to update the Open Data module would require the team to manually update the Open Data source file for all 10 communicable diseases and all years that are currently listed, which the program currently does not have the bandwidth for. Instead, the program will provide additional data from Annual Reports and other special reports that contain the same surveillance indicators.In the interim, interested users should visit the Communicable Disease Surveillance Data module on EpiQuery for the most current data: https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/epiquery/CDSS/index.html.
