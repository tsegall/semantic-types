There will be an opening reception with a Q&amp;A session on Saturday, March 11.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About <em>City Birds</em></strong><br />Raised in the Bronx, Elana Amity visited Poe Park numerous times. As a young child she roamed in and around the cottage, and as a teenager she and her friends danced while a band played in the gazebo. Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; was brought to life by her father who loved reciting poetry. Ironically, Poe completed his final revision of &quot;The Raven&quot; while living on 85 Amity Street, now West Third Street, in New York&rsquo;s Greenwich Village. Amity&rsquo;s current work includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City&rsquo;s parks, sidewalks, and window sills. Her birch bark paintings reflect images and textures found in natural settings. Her illustrated poems include the works of Wallace Steven, Edgar Allan Poe, William Wordsworth, and Wilfred Owen.</p><p><strong>Artist Bio</strong><br />New York City artist, Elana Amity, began her career as a teacher and freelance illustrator. She served on the board of the Society of Illustrators for many years. In 1984 she joined the faculty of LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts where she taught illustration, painting and drawing. In 2010 she opened a studio in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Her paintings, drawings and prints capture both fleeting and enduring moments oflife in cities, nature and beyond. Her work has been exhibited in galleries and public spaces at home and abroad.</p><p><strong>Related Events</strong></p><ul>	<li>March 11: <a href=""https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2017/03/11/arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity1"">Opening Reception</a></li>	<li>March 18: Artist Tour and Workshop</li>	<li>March 25: Elana Amity Book Presentation: The Raven</li>	<li>Angel Hernandez from The Bronx County Historical Society Lecture: Poe and The Raven</li></ul><p>Admission to the related events, including the opening reception,&nbsp;is free but space is limited.&nbsp;To RSVP, please email <a href=""mailto:laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov"">laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov</a> or call (718) 367-3657.</p><p>Image: Elana Amity, Cardinal with Sparrows, 2015, Acrylic on Canvas - www.elanaamity.com</p>","""City Birds"" includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City’s parks, sidewalks, and window sills.","(718) 367-3657","laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov","1",,"0","arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity1","0"

The artists in <em>STRATA </em>collect and arrange found or invented artifacts from the urban environment, including river flotsam, ceramic shards, and architectural details, through various modes of discovery. They use their collections as source material for multilayered, abstract compositions that reframe our familiar surroundings and challenge the division between man-made and organic in favor of a more seamless view of the material world. <em>STRATA</em> is on view in the Arsenal Gallery now through April 24, 2014.</p><p>	Marie Lorenz creates large scale, collograph prints from objects she collects on her excursions through New York City&rsquo;s waterways. In this new series of prints, Lorenz engages with the mysterious paths the objects have traveled by repeatedly printing the elements in ornate circular patterns, which evoke both tidal vortexes and folk art medallions.&nbsp;</p><p>	Katy Fischer&rsquo;s ceramic sculpture is reminiscent of archeological discoveries. She is inspired by the way ancient artifacts become evocatively abstract shapes once they are broken, weathered and displaced, not unlike the bits of debris deposited around the city. The shard-like fragments read as both found and made, broken and whole, abstract and representational and suggest intriguing connections and possible histories.</p><p>	On his walks around the city, Max Warsh photographs architectural facades, which are used as source material for his work. For these new pieces, Warsh photographed buildings in the neighborhood that surrounds the Arsenal. He then reconfigures these found textures, grooved surfaces and cast ornamental details in his studio through cutting, painting and collage to arrive at compositions that reinvigorate our engagement with the visual language of the urban landscape.</p><p>	In the work of all three artists, the fragment points to a larger more complete whole and a sense that a sum of the parts does or could exist. However each artist works to evade the reveal: we never see the whole building, the actual found object, or the unbroken pot. Rather, these fragmented compositions convey the way memory is an amalgamated fiction rather than a knowable fact.</p><p>	In conjunction with STRATA , Audra Wolowiec will present the sound installation <em>Weather Language</em> on April 14, 2014, 6:00 &ndash; 8:00 p.m. at the Arsenal. The sound piece will be composed of <em>a </em>mixture of found sounds and vocal interventions that are sensitive to both the Arsenal site and the city at large. Wolowiecs&rsquo; voice will overlap with the voices of strangers she encountered while walking through the city, creating a sound environment that is as subtle and ambiguous as the weather.</p>The Arsenal Gallery is dedicated to examining themes of nature, urban space, wildlife, New York City parks and park history.&nbsp; It is located on the third floor of the Parks Department Headquarters, in Central Park, on Fifth Avenue at 64th Street.&nbsp; Gallery hours are Monday &ndash; Friday, 9 a.m. &ndash; 5 p.m.&nbsp; Admission is free.&nbsp; For more information on the Arsenal Gallery, please call 212-360-8163.","The artists featured in STRATA, Marie Lorenz, Katy Fischer and Max Warsh, collect and arrange artifacts from the urban environment and create abstract compositions.","(212) 360-8163","Artandantiquities@parks.nyc.gov","1",,"0","strata","0"

The exhibit will be on view at the Poe Park Visitor Center on Tuedays through Saturdays from March 4 through March 29. There will be an opening reception with a Q&amp;A session on Saturday, March 11.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About <em>City Birds</em></strong><br />Raised in the Bronx, Elana Amity visited Poe Park numerous times. As a young child she roamed in and around the cottage, and as a teenager she and her friends danced while a band played in the gazebo. Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; was brought to life by her father who loved reciting poetry. Ironically, Poe completed his final revision of &quot;The Raven&quot; while living on 85 Amity Street, now West Third Street, in New York&rsquo;s Greenwich Village. Amity&rsquo;s current work includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City&rsquo;s parks, sidewalks, and window sills. Her birch bark paintings reflect images and textures found in natural settings. Her illustrated poems include the works of Wallace Steven, Edgar Allan Poe, William Wordsworth, and Wilfred Owen.</p><p><strong>Artist Bio</strong><br />New York City artist, Elana Amity, began her career as a teacher and freelance illustrator. She served on the board of the Society of Illustrators for many years. In 1984 she joined the faculty of LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts where she taught illustration, painting and drawing. In 2010 she opened a studio in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Her paintings, drawings and prints capture both fleeting and enduring moments oflife in cities, nature and beyond. Her work has been exhibited in galleries and public spaces at home and abroad.</p><p><strong>Related Events</strong></p><ul>	<li>March 11: <a href=""https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2017/03/11/arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity1"">Opening Reception</a></li>	<li>March 18: Artist Tour and Workshop</li>	<li>March 25: Elana Amity Book Presentation: The Raven</li>	<li>Angel Hernandez from The Bronx County Historical Society Lecture: Poe and The Raven</li></ul><p>Admission to the related events, including the opening reception,&nbsp;is free but space is limited.&nbsp;To RSVP, please email <a href=""mailto:laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov"">laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov</a> or call (718) 367-3657.</p><p>Image: Elana Amity, Cardinal with Sparrows, 2015, Acrylic on Canvas - www.elanaamity.com</p>","""City Birds"" includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City’s parks, sidewalks, and window sills.","(718) 367-3657","laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov","1",,"0","arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity","0"

With black and brown artists, writers, culture workers, and thinkers positioned centrally in each image, the exhibition spans green spaces throughout New York City&mdash;such as Riverside Park, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and Central Park&mdash;as well as select sites across the United States.</p><p>With each photograph, Green offers a statement of quietude, solace, insistence, and strength, making visible a community purportedly relegated to the margins, yet who critically inform dominant tastes and trends. These gentle, nuanced compositions are particularly urgent within the context of seemingly interminable sociopolitical crisis, where black and brown bodies are continually imaged as sites of violence and trauma. Within the framework of <em>A Collective Utterance</em>, each individual is left to be&mdash;in all of their tenderness, complexities, and intricacies.</p><p><em>A Collective Utterance</em> is organized by Oluremi C. Onabanjo.</p>","Spanning sites such as Riverside Park and Central Park, Green’s photographs present quiet, quotidian portraits—nuanced compositions that revel in her subjects’ subtle gestures, varied postures, and soft gazes.","(212) 360-8163","artandantiquities@parks.nyc.gov","1",,"0","arsneal-gallery-opening-reception-a-collective-utterance-naima-green","0"
