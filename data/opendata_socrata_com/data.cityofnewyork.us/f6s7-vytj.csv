"2","02M422","Quest to Learn","Quest to Learn teachers make learning fun and challenging. Teachers work with curriculum developers to design games that build academic and social skills. In ELA courses, students use table games to debate the strength of evidence; in math, students use a card game, Absolute Dash, to mix and match integer operations to gain the most points. All students have small group advisory twice a week to build community and promote social-emotional learning. As they build skills, students demonstrate their learning through collaborative, creative projects, taking a variety of roles from newscast producer to Revolutionary War spy to roller-coaster architect. We make learning challenging. At the end of each semester, middle school students participate in week-long design competitions. Instead of regular classes, students work in groups of 12 to create projects such as fashion shows, restaurants, and newspapers. We are inclusive in how we accept students into our school -- we do not screen. We are also inclusive in our programming within our walls -- we do not place students in high, medium, or low classes. We challenge all students academically providing every 8th grade student with Earth Science and Algebra Regents courses.","Chelsea","351 West  18 Street, New York, NY 10011","Yes-02M440","Partially Accessible","212-488-3645","www.q2L.org","https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/9036","A, C, E, L to 14th St-8th Ave; 2, 3, F, M to 14th St; 1 to 18th St","M11, M12, M14A, M14D, M20, M23, M5, M7, X27, X28","M422L","Quest To Learn","Open","346","99","4","4","24","96","N","Y","Open to residents of New York City",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"96","44","24","Quest to Learn",,,"79","581","6-12","This school will give priority to applicants eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (FRL) for up to 60 percent of the seats","8:05 am","2:25 pm","English as a New Language",,"Spanish","Spanish,Algebra I,Earth Science","Advisory, Algebra I, Art, Computer Science, Creative Writing, Film, Fine Arts, Foreign Language, Game Design, Graphic Design, Health, National Junior Honor Society, Peer Mediation, Physical Education, Spanish, Specialized High School Test Preparation, Student Council, Technology, Theater, Visual Arts, Yearbook","Art, Book Club, Chess, Coding, Comic Book Club, Cooking, Creative Writing, Dance, Drama, Fashion, Fitness, Green Team, Homework Help, Leadership, Lego Robotics, Math Team, Music, Musical Theater, National Junior Honor Society, Peer Mediation, Photography, Restorative Circles, Robotics, School Newspaper, Service Learning, STEM, Student Council, Talent Show, Technology, Theater, Tutoring, Urban Arts, Video Game Club, Visual Arts, Yearbook, Yoga, Hip Hop Poetry, Parkour, Minecraft Club","Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Dance, Fencing, Fitness Club, Flag Football, Martial Arts, Running Club, Soccer, Softball, Table Tennis, Track and Field, Ultimate Frisbee, Volleyball, Wrestling, Yoga","10011","MANHATTAN","40.742867","-74.002136","104","3","89","1013096","1007420007","Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square"

At LMC students take four arts courses: Digital Arts, Dance, Music, and Visual Arts and have the opportunity engage with the art course to which they feel the greatest connection.  Every day our students begin in a small advisory group of 10-12 of their peers.  Led by one of their teachers, our advisory curriculum explores such topics as goal-setting, identity, values, service, and human rights.  Our advisories serve as a structure around which we plan the many field trips in which our students participate throughout the year, including overnight trips.  In advisory we also prepare students for the opportunity of ""out lunch"" for which students in good academic standing are eligible after the first trimester of 6th grade.  At LMC our robust after school program, developed in partnership with Manhattan Youth, build on our arts, academic, and advisory programs through daily programming that is free of charge.","Financial District","26 Broadway, New York, NY 10004","Yes-02M282","Fully Accessible","646-826-8100","www.lmc896.org","https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/9069","N to South Ferry; J, Z to Broad St; E to World Trade Center; A, C to Fulton St-Broadway-Nassau; 4, 5 to Bowling Green; 2, 3 to Wall St; 1, R to Whitehall St-South Ferry; 1, R to Rector St","BM1, BM2, BM3, BM4, BxM18, M15, M15-SBS, M20, M5, M9, QM11, QM25, QM7, QM8, X1, X10, X10B, X11, X12, X14, X15, X17, X17A, X19, X2, X27, X28, X3, X37, X38, X4, X42, X5, X7, X8, X9","M896S","Lower Manhattan Community Middle School (M.S. 896)","Screened","451","105","5","4","24","96","Y","Y","Open to students and residents of District 2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"100","69","64","Millennium High School","Fiorello H.

We believe that students who love languages can learn best through the dual language structure. Students are encouraged to question, challenge, make real decisions, and work collaboratively to solve problems. Through a rigorous project-directed, theme-based curriculum, children learn that school is a place to develop respect for self and others. Our mission is founded on the premise that we must experience an atmosphere of trust, safety, security, and personal attention in order to develop emotional and intellectual growth.   At DLMS, each student is assigned an advisor to help them and their families navigate the middle school experiences. Our students take overnight trips to Camp Manice, visit universities like New York University and Fordham, and have mentors from Salesforce and the National Basketball Association to support their growth and development. In addition to core academic classes, all students take 3 years of Spanish, Visual Arts, Physical Education and Dance, with at least two public dance performances per year.

The school prepares students for professional music careers while recognizing that not every student will choose such a career. The underlying philosophy of the Special Music School is the belief that music education for gifted pupils requires: 1) extensive opportunities to work one-to-one with an outstanding instrumental faculty; 2) a structured, sequential music curriculum; 3) opportunities to perform before audiences; and 4) interaction between general academics and musical studies. Our goal is to see each child reach his or her academic and musical potential. Our vision is that all students will become lifelong learners and critical thinkers in our caring and respectful learning environment.

Over the course of a scholar's three years at UIM they will have multiple entry points into a STEAM curriculum. Whether it be through web-design, our Makeosity Makers program, digital arts, or our math club, all scholars will be exposed to the world of STEAM. All classes are rooted in the Common Core and aim to prepare scholars for college and beyond. All scholars are enrolled in a strategic reading or mathematics period as we believe sound literacy and numeracy skills are the key to success in the future.
