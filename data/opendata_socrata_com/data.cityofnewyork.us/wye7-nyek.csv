"Hunts Point Interstate Access Improvement - Phase I","2017-04-17T00:00:00.000","X731.63 D900047","The Hunts Point Peninsula is located in the South Bronx, New York, and is home to the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, the largest food distribution facility in the nation. The Hunts Point Peninsula is also home to many industrial and commercial properties outside of the food distribution center. There is also a residential area in the northeastern portion of the peninsula. To access the food distribution center, vehicles must exit the interstate highway network and use local streets. The needs for the project are to improve access to and from the Hunts Point Peninsula and the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center/ commercial establishments, to address the existing non-standard geometric features of the Bruckner/Sheridan Interchange to improve operations, and to address infrastructure deficiencies on the Bruckner Expressway viaduct and ramps and truss bridge carrying westbound Bruckner Expressway and Bruckner Boulevard over Amtrak.
The purpose of the project is to provide improved access between the Hunts Point Peninsula and the Sheridan and Bruckner Expressways for automobiles and trucks traveling to and from the commercial businesses located on the peninsula. In addition, the project will address structural and operational deficiencies related to the existing infrastructure within the established project limits.

Permittee is responsible for convening a site visit to inspect the path and to ensure it will provide satisfactory access for Park operations before the lower path is closed to vehicular traffic. Inspection of the paved upper path to Parks' sole satisfaction is required before any closures or work necessitating closures of the lower path can commence.
The following conditions generally apply to ongoing work in Inwood Hill Park
Permittees are required to install tree guards on all trees along the pathway with the guardrail, from their parking lot service gate, northward to active work zones.
Permittees to install silt fencing at pathway edge to reduce impact/compaction on land adjacent to pathways
Permittees to develop signage to install at the approach to the lower path to prevent vehicles from entering the interim pedestrian pathway.
Permittees to develop signage directing service/emergency vehicles to use the upper path and note that the lower pathway is closed, as well as signs indicating the same for those approaching the lower path from the Shorakapok Rock area.

From the 2013 narrative to PDC: It is the intent of design team to construct a new power and control panel aboveground and demolish
the existing one inside the pump station. As a result, NYCDEP is presenting the replacement alternative
electrical panel similar in concept to the concrete foundation of the existing Back Flow Prevention
housing at the site. The proposed cabinet housing the electrical switch board will be custom built to
match the characteristics of existing Back Flow Prevention cabinet. The control panel cabinet will be
constructed of sheet metal panels with required grills to ventilate the heat generated by the control
equipment. To add a playful note next to the existing playground situated on the north side and sit well
with the existing gray metal finish of the Back Flow Prevention cabinet towards the street, we are
coating the proposed structure with two similar metallic finishes, as befits these metal cabinets. The
control cabinets will be built of sheet metal with metallic finish to provide durable life to sustain the
environmental elements. The design as presented is simple with minimal contrast or hindrance to the
surrounding areas. The existing areas of the pump station are fenced in with 6 foot high chain linkfencing
with limited trees and vegetation. The site is secured with a lockable chain‐link double swing
gate. The Electrical Board Switch location also complies with the 500 year Flood Plan Map.","Q099;","Flushing Meadows Corona Park;","Park Drive East & 73 Terrace","Queens","Single Site","DEP","Sewer/Water Plant","Borough Forestry;#Capital Projects","Park Improvement;#Excavation",,"Construction",,,"Hazen & Sawyer but see scoping note","Yes","2013-11-12T00:00:00.000",,,,,,"Assistant Resident Engineer","Entech",,,,,,,"2016-04-22T00:00:00.000","Approved","QP18-044",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2018-01-23T13:15:00.000","2020-03-25T13:35:00.000","40.722364, -73.826827"

"Central Park - Modifications to Gatehouse No. 1","2018-02-13T00:00:00.000","JOC15-BWSO-3G #170794.70","FROM DEP: Central Park Reservoir was once part of the Old Croton water system and served as a drinking water reservoir for New York City. While it is no longer used to store drinking water, the reservoir is still connected to old, unused aqueducts, which are isolated from the drinking water system by a series of valves. The reservoir is also considered a dam because of its dividing wall, which now normally sits below the water level.
DEP’s project for the reservoir serves two purposes. This project will improve the isolation, protection and resiliency of the reservoir’s dam structure by separating it from the old and deteriorated aqueduct structure. This work will also provide additional protection against possible cross connection between the reservoir water body and active City water system infrastructure, improving the resiliency of the water supply for Manhattan.
Also, repairs to the structure's hazardous roof will be made, including internal concrete and exterior stone repair.","M010;","Central Park;","Central Park Reservoir","Manhattan","Single Site","DEP","Sewer/Water Plant","Conservancy","Partial Park Closure","638000","Presumed Complete",,,,,,,,,,"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000","PM","DEP",,"2018-08-15T00:00:00.000","2018-12-15T00:00:00.000","Pro Con",,,"2018-02-20T00:00:00.000",,,"as a last-minute idea and addition work area will be enclosed with CL fence on barrier. 24 hour security may be provided onsite - TBD.

It is also possible that corrugated pipe running under the parkway and parks has collapsed, in which case more invasive followup work will be required.
