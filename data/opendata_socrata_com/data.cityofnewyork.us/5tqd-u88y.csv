SOURCES: IBO; Mayor's Office of Management and Budget (OMB); New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (various years).</p>

NOTES:</br>
(1) Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.</br>

(2) New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years' debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year.</br>

(3) The defeasance of $536 million of GO bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>

(4) The defeasance of $1.986 billion of GO bonds in 2008 reduced debt service in 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>

(5) The defeasance of $718 million of TFA bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>

(6) The defeasance of $196 million of TFA bonds in 2013 reduced debt service in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>

(7) The defeasance of $637 million of TFA bonds in 2015 with savings from Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR) reduced debt service in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>

(8) The defeasance of $65 million of Jay Street Development Corporation (JSDC) bonds in 2007 reduced debt service in 2009 and 2010. Debt service in the table is presented as if the defeasance had not occurred.</br>

(9) TFA BARBs and TSASC are not included in OMB's or the Comptroller's definitions of New York City outstanding debt. For an explanation of these items, and their inclusion in NYC IBO's definition of New York City outstanding debt, please see New Outstanding Debt.</br>

(10) In 2006, TSASC restructured its outstanding indebtedness. This included a one time expense of $161 million for redeeming all bonds issued under a secured loan agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, via the department's Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Additionally, all prior year TSASC bond series were defeased, leaving only series 2006-1 bonds outstanding. </br>","dataset","City Government","Yes","https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/6ggx-itps","3/6/2014","Annually","2021-06-25T15:59:34.000","No","No","Yes","No","N/A","Yes","Annually","No","348","25","22",,"false"

As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.","dataset","Education","No","https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/f3u3-q8ea","10/11/2011","Historical data","2011-10-05T20:58:53.000","No","No","Yes","No","N/A","No","N/A","No","246","53959","16",,"false"

This data can be used by agencies and the public to better understand the demographic makeup of client populations and to better understand and serve residents of all backgrounds and identities.

The data presented here has been collected through either electronic form or paper surveys offered at the point of application for services. These surveys are anonymous.

Each record represents an anonymized demographic profile of an individual applicant for social services, disaggregated by response option, agency, and program. Response options include information regarding ancestry, race, primary and secondary languages, English proficiency, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

Idiosyncrasies or Limitations: 
Note that while the dataset contains the total number of individuals who have identified their ancestry or languages spoke, because such data is collected anonymously, there may be instances of a single individual completing multiple voluntary surveys. Additionally, the survey being both voluntary and anonymous has advantages as well as disadvantages: it increases the likelihood of full and honest answers, but since it is not connected to the individual case, it does not directly inform delivery of services to the applicant. The paper and online versions of the survey ask the same questions but free-form text is handled differently. Free-form text fields are expected to be entered in English although the form is available in several languages. Surveys are presented in 11 languages.  
  Paper Surveys
   1. Are optional
   2. Survey taker is expected to specify agency that provides service
   2. Survey taker can skip or elect not to answer questions

This dataset contains information on all items designated or under consideration for designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC). The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the ""MOST_CURRENT,"" ""BBL_STATUS and ""LAST_ACTION_ON_LP"" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this data set.

Only the first report is counted in the data presented here. Laboratories are required to electronically report positive hepatitis B test results, as well as negative results for hepatitis B DNA. The Health Department does not routinely investigate hepatitis B reports because of the large volume; therefore it is difficult to determine when people with these infections were first infected, although most were probably infected a while ago. Case counts represent people newly reported with hepatitis B and are not prevalence or incidence. Many people with hepatitis B are asymptomatic; as a result, many cases are not diagnosed or reported.

"Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR)","dbmp-698d","Schoolyard to Playgrounds","The Schoolyards to Playgrounds initiative began with PlaNYC 2007 as a way to expand public use at existing City facilities and improve access to open spaces during non-school hours which includes weekends, holidays, and during the summer. 
 
NYC Parks, in collaboration with the Department of Education (DOE) and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land have improved hundreds of DOE operated schoolyards through capital improvements, including play equipment, painted sports surfaces, trees, and benches.
 
The program is an important approach to reaching the city’s target to getting more New Yorkers within walking distance to open-space. In many neighborhoods, these DOE schoolyards are one of the few resources that can be improved and provide publicly accessible open space.
 
Each record in this dataset represents a participating DOE Schoolyard at the time of the dataset's publication. The schoolyard's boundaries have been drawn in whole or part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified. 
 
 For more information on the Schoolyard to Playgrounds program, visit: https://www.nycgovparks.org/greening/planyc/schoolyards
 
This dataset may be updated throughout the year as school's join or exit the program.

Categories with total enrollment values of zero were omitted.
Pre-K data includes students in 3-K.
Data on students with disabilities, English language learners, and student poverty status are as of March 19, 2021. 
Due to missing demographic information in rare cases and suppression rules, demographic categories do not always add up to total enrollment and/or citywide totals.
NYC DOE ""Eligible for free or reduced-price lunch” counts are based on the number of students with families who have qualified for free or reduced-price lunch or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) benefits.
English Language Arts and Math state assessment results for students in grade 9 are not available for inclusion in this report, as the spring 2020 exams did not take place.
Spring 2021 ELA and Math test results are not included in this report for K-8 students in 2020-21. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s complete transformation of New York City’s school system during the 2020-21 school year, and in accordance with New York State guidance, the 2021 ELA and Math assessments were optional for students to take. As a result, 21.6% of students in grades 3-8 took the English assessment in 2021 and 20.5% of students in grades 3-8 took the Math assessment. These participation rates are not representative of New York City students and schools and are not comparable to prior years, so results are not included in this report. 
Dual Language enrollment includes English Language Learners and non-English Language Learners. 
Dual Language data are based on data from STARS; as a result, school participation and student enrollment in Dual Language programs may differ from the data in this report. STARS course scheduling and grade management software applications provide a dynamic internal data system for school use; while standard course codes exist, data are not always consistent from school to school.
This report does not include enrollment at District 75 & 79 programs. Students enrolled at Young Adult Borough Centers are represented in the 9-12 District data but not the 9-12 School data.
“Prior Year” data included in Comparison tabs refers to data from 2019-20. “Year-to-Year Change” data included in Comparison tabs indicates whether the demographics of a school or special program have grown more or less similar to its district or attendance zone (or school, for special programs) since 2019-20. Year-to-year changes must have been at least 1 percentage point to qualify as “More Similar” or “Less Similar”; changes less than 1 percentage point are categorized as “No Change”. 
The admissions method tab contains information on the admissions methods used for elementary, middle, and high school programs during the Fall 2020 admissions process. Fall 2020 selection criteria are included for all programs with academic screens, including middle and high school programs. Selection criteria data is based on school-reported information. Fall 2020 Diversity in Admissions priorities is included for applicable middle and high school programs. Note that the data on each school’s demographics and performance includes all students of the given subgroup who were enrolled in the school on November 13, 2020. Some of these students may not have been admitted under the admissions method(s) shown, as some students may have enrolled in the school outside the centralized admissions process (via waitlist, over-the-counter, or transfer), and schools may have changed admissions methods over the past few years.

About the Data

All NYC children are required to be tested for lead poisoning at around age 1 and age 2, and to be screened for risk of lead poisoning, and tested if at risk, up until age 6. These data are an indicator of children younger that 6 years of age tested in NYC in a given year with blood lead levels of 5 mcg/dL or greater. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. The reference level is determined by measuring the NHANES blood lead distribution in US children ages 1 to 5 years, and is reviewed every 4 years.","dataset","Health","YES","https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/tnry-kwh5","1/2/2019","Annually","2018-07-12T19:48:18.000","Yes","No","Yes","No","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","3122","576","19",,"false"

Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need.

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores, % SpEd, and % Overage.

The eight land cover classes mapped were: (1) Tree Canopy, (2) Grass\Shrubs, (3) Bare Soil, (4) Water, (5) Buildings, (6) Roads, (7) Other Impervious, and (8) Railroads. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2017 LiDAR (1-ft post spacing) and 2016 4-band orthoimagery (0.5-ft resolution). Object based image analysis was used to automate land-cover features using LiDAR point clouds and derivatives, orthoimagery, and vector GIS datasets --

In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam.

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. 

The NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school.

In most areas, LiDAR was captured during low tide (defined here as a range between Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and MLLW + 30% of the mean tide range). All bathymetric LiDAR and most near-infrared (NIR) LiDAR was captured during low tide. Flights flown over NIR LiDAR shoreline areas that are largely made up of sea walls and riprap were not flown during low tide. Tidal gauges used to determine low tide: Kings Point, Bergen West, Sandy Hook, and The Battery. See dataset attributes for which areas are tidally-coordinated.

Community members discuss local needs and develop proposals to meet these needs. Through a public vote, residents then decide which proposals to fund.

"Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)","vajk-p37e","DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Neighborhood Poverty","This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) neighborhood poverty group. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-poverty.csv 


Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.

These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.

In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)

Neighborhood-level poverty groups were classified in a manner consistent with Health Department practices to describe and monitor disparities in health in NYC. Neighborhood poverty measures are defined as the percentage of people earning below the Federal Poverty Threshold (FPT) within a ZCTA. The standard cut-points for defining categories of neighborhood-level poverty in NYC are:
•	Low: <10% of residents in ZCTA living below the FPT
•	Medium: 10% to <20%
•	High: 20% to <30%
•	Very high: ≥30% residents living below the FPT
The ZCTAs used for classification reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.

Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. Rates for poverty were calculated using direct standardization for age at diagnosis and weighting by the US 2000 standard population.
Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.

Data are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date.

SOURCES: 10/31/06 Official Register (K-9) and 12/15/06 Register/Schedule (9-12)
#Grade 9 not in high schools
##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school.

Notes:
As of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.
Starting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.
In 2007, the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.","dataset","Education","No","https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/g8e6-y4ax","10/11/2011","Historical data","2011-10-05T21:17:11.000","No","No","Yes","No","N/A","No","N/A","No","395","98982","16",,"false"

In 2018, NYSED rescaled the Math and ELA exams to account for a change in test administration from 3 days to 2 days. Therefore, 2018 and 2019 results can be compared to each other but cannot be compared to prior years.  
Starting in 2013, NYSED changed the exams to be Common Core aligned. 
In order to comply with regulations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) on public reporting of education outcomes, groups with 5 or fewer tested students are suppressed with an “s”. In addition, groups with the next lowest number of tested students are suppressed when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted.
District 75 students are included in city-level results. For 2013, District 75 students are attributed to their geographic borough. For 2014 and later, they are not included in borough-level results. For all years, District 75 students are assigned to their geographic district for district-level results. District 75 schools are not included in school-level results.
Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: https://infohub.nyced.org/reports-and-policies/citywide-information-and-data/test-results
Data for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders. Small ethnic categories of Multi-racial and Native American are not shown due to small cell counts.
Economically disadvantaged students include those identified by the State as eligible for free or reduced-price lunch or other economic assistance programs.
Current English Language Learners (ELLs) are those identified as an ELL during the reported year. Ever ELLs are those identified as ELL any year prior to the reported year but not including the reported year. Never ELLs are those never reported to have received ELL services. Data disaggregated by ELL status are available starting in 2014. Data for the 7th grade Ever ELLs Math exam are available starting in 2015. Data for Ever ELLs and Never ELLs may differ from those reported by NYSED due to timing.
In 2007, NYSED updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously, ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam. 
A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates on the State math assessment in 2014: to reduce double testing, most students in accelerated math courses who took the Integrated Algebra Regents exam were exempted from taking the 7th or 8th grade State math assessment.","dataset","Education","YES","https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/hvdr-xc2s",,"Historical data","2022-03-08T12:29:59.000","No","No","Yes","No","N/A","Yes","Historical","No","129","32765","18",,"false"

"Department of Education (DOE)","gqq2-hgxd","2016-17 - 2020-21 School End-of-Year Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data","Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.
Attendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.
Starting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.
School-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.
All demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.
Students With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.
English language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.
Only grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for ""All Grades"" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to ""All Grades"". 
Data include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.
Data for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders . Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the ""Other"" ethnicity category.
In order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an ""s"". Using total days of attendance as a proxy , rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an ""s"" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute  at least 20 days is five or fewer. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.
Interactions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day.

NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement.

Students are reported as those who were planned and routed, but may or may not have used the service provided.
Routes were determined by those routed with a vendor and student(s) assigned
Vehicles are identified by school bus company reported data. This data is subject to data entry error and is dependent on the school bus companies to maintain.
All transportation sites were included, and reported by type. A transportation site was defined by a unique location identified by a street address. Please note: multiple students or schools can be located in the same address and would therefore represent a stop for multiple students at the same site.
MetroCard passes are assigned at the school. For public and charter schools, OPT reports students assigned to MetroCard, which includes those assigned a MetroCard by serial number or ""T'd"" for MetroCard, meaning the school indicated the student as eligible for a MetroCard but did not yet assign a serial number. For Non-Public schools, OPT reports on students who are eligible for MetoCards if they are not assigned to yellow bus service
Some special education schools do not classify students by grade level. Students attending such schools are identified as “NG.”
Service type is representative only of the type of busing a student is assigned to and is not reflective of the educational classification of a student. Students who are classified as special education but do not have an IEP mandate for specific transportation accommodations may be assigned to general education busing. General education students under certain circumstances including, but not limited to temporary housing status, orders of protection and medical conditions may be assigned to special education busing.
OPT assigns students to busing but cannot confirm student ridership. This reporting would have to be captured at the school level.
Students in temporary housing (STH) situations other than those reported to be living in a DHS shelter* were excluded from the report due to data quality issues. While the DOE student data system (ATS) has a housing indicator flag, it is often inaccurate and unreliable. Therefore, OPT cannot reliably report on the temporary housing status of students other than those residing in DHS shelters, where a daily report indicating shelter status is provided. 
*Transportation data for students in Foster Care is also provided. Please see section 21-993 B7 for reporting.
Stop to school bus service is typically not provided to students after the 6th grade. Those assigned to this service are students who are granted individual or school-wide exceptions.
In addition to students who applied for transportation because of foster care placement, also reported were students known to be in foster care who received busing or A MetroCard to provide a more complete report of students in foster care who received service.

NTAs were delineated with the need for both geographic specificity and statistical reliability in mind. Consequently, each NTA contains enough population to mitigate sampling error associated with the ACS yet offers a unit of analysis that is smaller than a Community District.

Though NTA boundaries and their associated names roughly correspond with many neighborhoods commonly recognized by New Yorkers, NTAs are not intended to definitively represent neighborhoods, nor are they intended to be exhaustive of all possible names and understandings of neighborhoods throughout New York City. Additionally, non-residential areas including large parks, airports, cemeteries, and other special areas are represented separately within this dataset and are assigned codes according to their type (See NTAType field).

DCWP's Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) also developed NFH Indexes to present patterns in the data within and across neighborhoods. NFH Index scores describe relative differences between neighborhoods across the same indicators; they do not evaluate neighborhoods against fixed standards. OFE intends for the NFH Indexes to provide an easy reference tool for comparing neighborhoods, and to establish patterns in the relationship of NFH indicators to economic and demographic factors, such as race and income. Understanding these connections is potentially useful for uncovering systems that perpetuate the racial wealth gap, an issue with direct implications for OFE’s mission to expand asset building opportunities for New Yorkers with low and moderate incomes. This data tool was borne out of the Collaborative for Neighborhood Financial Health, a community-led initiative designed to better understand how neighborhoods influence the financial health of their residents.","dataset","Business","YES","https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/r3dx-pew9","6/24/2022","Historical data","2022-05-02T15:12:34.000","No","No","Yes","No","N/A","No","N/A","No","296","385","52",,"false"
