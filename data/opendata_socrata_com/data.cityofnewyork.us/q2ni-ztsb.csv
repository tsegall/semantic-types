As of right now practice is being held 2 days a week for all players.  As the teams grow and learn to play together we will begin to enter into more competitive play and tournaments.  

There will be a fee for each player, but it is our goal to keep the cost as low as possible for our players.  In order to keep the fees as low as possible, we need your help. This is where you, the parents, come in. As we all know parents play a major role in everything that their child does, and we hope that you will show the same eagerness to support our league that you do other aspects of your child’s life.  Being involved, takes effort, commitment, and a healthy dose of patience. It also means shuttling your children back and forth to practices and sneaking out of work early to attend games – but that’s just the beginning.

El Museo’s teaching artists work with students to explore the museum’s Permanent Collection and temporary exhibitions, and the history and culture of El Barrio and its residents in a walking tour of the neighborhood. Students will learn and discuss ways in which neighborhoods have been shaped by both the cultural and social practices of its residents, focusing both on El Barrio and their own neighborhoods. The ATB art making activities will extend learning about our relationship with our community and involve critical reflection upon the role each student and their own cultural traditions and practices have in their own ‘barrios.’  Their final projects are included in El Museo’s annual Youth Art Show, held annually in the spring.
