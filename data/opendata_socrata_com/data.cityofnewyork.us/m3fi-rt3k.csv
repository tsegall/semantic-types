Lighthouse boat tours would leave from site with a host of on site cultural  recreational activities: concerts, maritime festivals,arts  crafts shows etc.taking place on Lighthouse Plaza  boating events like FLEET Week, OP sail on adjacent Pier.

This past year over 200 families were served working with different community organizations in all five boroughs.  The Broadway League created Family First Nights as a way to introduce families from underserved communities to live theatre and encourage children to develop a life-long appreciation for the art form, an opportunity many participants may not otherwise have.  

Working with Council Member Weprin, the Broadway League will partner with a local social service agency to identify families and coordinate program logistics.  Families in the program commit to attend the theatre together three times over the course of a year and coordinate with the local social service agency to arrange transportation.  Families will take part in post-performance discussions with the cast and production staff of the shows, and are given packets with information on the theatre and the specific show.  Sponsors of the program are invited to join the families at their designated location before departing for photos and an opportunity to meet the participants.  Families have recently attended performances of MEMPHIS, IN THE HEIGHTS, THE COLOR PURPLE, BILLY ELLIOT, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, SHREK, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, HAIRSPRAY and many other Broadway productions.

By engaging families in repeated experiences through multiple productions, Family First Nights offers the opportunity to make live theatre part of their cultural heritage, as well as educate children on the many non-performing job opportunities available in our industry.

The Broadway League is the national trade association for the Broadway industry. The Leagueâs 700-plus members including theatre owners and operators, producers, presenters, and general managers help bring Broadway to more than 30 million people in New York each year.",,,"729 Seventh Avenue 5th Floor

      In FY2012, CAT will also use interactive drama to address: SCHOOL VIOLENCE PREVENTION â including Cyberbullying.  This spring CAT will begin a new pilot initiative in three high-needs public middle schools to use interactive drama as a strategy to divert sixth graders from gravitating to violence, harassment, bullying. PUBLIC HEALTH - Project CHANGE is CATâs new 5-year initiative to mentor CUNY students to use interactive drama to become advocates for adolescent reproductive health.  LITERACY - CAT plans to continue its partnership with the NYC Dept. of Education to deliver more than 30 day-long, interactive workshops on drama as a teaching strategy for Universal Pre-K educators. CAT will also continue its successful In-Class Literacy Program, which strengthens basic literacy skills through the arts.

In addition, according to a survey of Mermaid Ave. merchants conducted by an Astella intern in 2010, cleanliness of Mermaid Ave. was cited as the number one concern among merchants on Mermaid Ave. A cleaner commercial corridor will inspire confidence and pride in the neighborhood, provide a welcoming environment for shoppers, a boost for Mermaid Ave. businesses, and sends the message that a clean neighborhood is important to the community and encourages residents and visitors to Mermaid Ave. not to liter and improve overall cleanliness. Astella will engage the services of a power-washing cleaning company to apply high pressure, hot-water power washers to remove tough dirt, stains, and gum on the sidewalk surfaces along Mermaid Ave. In addition, Astella will initiate a pilot program, hiring three Coney Island residents three times a week from May through November to sweep the sidewalks and street corners, and collect and bag refuse, including cans, bottles, food and food wrappers, newspapers, etc. One of those individuals will also serve as a crew supervisor.

Prospect Parkâs 585 acres of meadows, waterfalls, forest, lakes, and athletic facilities comprise a masterwork of urban green space.

The Alliance requests Member Expense items to support Youth and Environmental Programs in the Park.  Specifically, with this funding, school groups from the members district can come to educational programs at the Prospect Park Audubon Center or Lefferts Historic House.

Located at the Parkâs historic Boathouse, the Prospect Park Audubon Center, a partnership between Audubon New York and the Prospect Park Alliance, is the nationâs first urban Audubon Center, and a national model that is being replicated in numerous cities.  The Center offers ongoing and special exhibits, family workshops, free art and science classes, drop-in programs, adult workshops, guided and self-guided nature tours and trails, citizen science activities, and tours of the Lullwater and Lake on the Electric Boat.  Last year, the Prospect Park Audubon Center served 70,651 people (primarily children and families) through public programs and an additional 12,640 children through school programs.   

Lefferts Historic House is an 18th Century farmhouse that the Alliance operates as a museum dedicated to the history of Brooklyn, Prospect Park, and the seasonal cycles of life in the farming village of Flatbush.  Through ongoing and temporary exhibits, workshops, and seasonal events, Lefferts engages imaginations through interpreting and dramatizing daily life in a rural community of early 19th Century America.  Lefferts continues to function as a model working farmhouse, growing small samples of crops that early residents planted.

BYCA now stands as one of the countryâs leading youth choruses, providing a comprehensive music education program of unparalleled quality to students of all cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. 
_x000D_
BYCA is exceptional for its experiential approach to music education; for its inclusive approach to helping children succeed musically; for its commitment to diversity, both musical and cultural; and for the extraordinarily high quality of its concert performances.  BYCA has performed with a wide-range of world-class performers such as the New York Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, Elton John, Alicia Keys and Lou Reed.  Few music organizations combine a commitment to broad service and inclusiveness with such high artistic goals.  BYCA is both an educational institution and a group of progressively advanced performing ensembles.  We serve over 325 students each year who study and perform as part of a choral ensemble grouped by age, skill and experience. 
_x000D_
BYCA respectfully requests the funding from the New York City Council to support and expand its Financial Aid Program.  BYCA keeps tuition low, from 650-875 per year, and ensures that no student is turned away due to an inability to pay.  BYCA continues to raise its commitment to offering financial aid in the face of rising need, currently offering over 85,000 in financial aid to roughly 100 students and nearly a third of our chorister population.  An all-time record for BYCA.  We seek to strengthen and further expand our financial aid program in FY 12 by offering support to additional 25 disadvantaged youngsters who would otherwise not be able to attend our program.

Since our founding in 1997, FSH boasts a 100 high school graduation rate among FSH seniors and a 0 pregnancy rate for all. 

More than 2/3 of our students come from low-income families or families living at/below the poverty level; 72 identify as black, 15 as Latina, and 13 as multiracial; 43 are 6â9 years old, the rest 10â18. Each year, about 70 of girls return to the program from the previous year, and our daily attendance rate is generally a very high 95.

To participate in the program, all girls must achieve or maintain a âBâ grade average or better in school. FSH provides tutoring and homework assistance to support the girls academically, and last season 94 met or exceeded this goal! In addition, girls participate in a series of 4 age-appropriate 6-week educational workshops on Financial Literacy, Communication  Public Speaking, Nutrition  Fitness, and Skating Theory  History that also strengthen their core academic skills. Girls also participate in cultural field trips; fitness and dance classes; college preparation workshops; mentoring, internship, and leadership opportunities; career week; and, new this season, a 16-week SAT test preparation program.

For the ice skating component, FSH provides each girl with skating instruction, equipment, and attire. Students measure their skills development with the Ice Skating Institute (ISI) Standards tests, and we emphasize that each of their successes on the ice models how they can set goals and pursue success in all other aspects of their lives. Last season, 96 passed at least one ISI test level, 13 passed two, and one student passed three.

Funding would be applied to ice time and classroom rental expenses.",,,"361 West 125th Street

Personal Emergency Response System- 5,000 The moments immediately following a fall or medical emergency are crucial, and if the victim is unable to get to a telephone, the consequences can be serious. For frail seniors who live alone, the ability to call for help in an emergency is essential to their safety. A Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) is an electronic device designed to allow elderly and disabled people to more easily summon help in an emergency.  The tenants receiving these services live alone and would not be able to afford advanced safety net technology like PERS on their own. In addition to installation costs, these systems require monthly monitoring fees that are not supported by Medicare or by most insurance providers. Your continued support will allow our tenants, as well as their family members and caregivers, to continue enjoying the additional safety and peace of mind that this service provides.

Car Service- 6,000_x000D_
Transportation is in great demand among our frail seniors at Selfhelp Queensview/North Queensview NORC, as it enables them to go about their daily lives with greater freedom and independence. Selfhelp contracts with a taxi company to provide car service that enables seniors to attend their doctor appointments, visit family and friends, make shopping trips, and attend memorial services. Many of our frail seniors have age-related physical limitations, such as poor vision and hearing, respiratory conditions, and/or cognitive impairments, which make it very difficult to utilize public transportation.

We do this by partnering with public middle schools in low income, high-need communities and extend their learning day by 3 hours each day (a 35 increase over the regular school day). In that time, we work on academic support; 21st Century skills like teamwork, leadership, public speaking; and, most importantly, we help learning come to life for students through our apprenticeship model. Apprenticeships are taught by professionals in the private and public sector over a 10-week period on subjects that they are passionate about. For instance this past semester we had law students teach public speaking through a mock trial apprenticeship and a few teams of Google engineers teach math through video game design. At the end of the apprenticeship, the students present what they learned in a final product called a WOW! in front of an audience. Each WOW! incorpo!
 rates the content of the apprenticeship and ensure students are developing and using those 21st century skills. 
Part of what makes us unique and successful is that we have full-time staff in the school during the school day. They prepare for the 3-6pm program time by integrating into the school during the day. They observe teachers as they demonstrate both pedagogical and content knowledge, so that they can teach more effectively during the academic blocks of the Citizen Schools program. That way, when a teacher teaches fractions in a certain way, our staff knows that method as well and can streamline communication with the school staff and students. Additionally, our staff knows when tests are, both school and standardized, and can help students prepare in whichever way makes the most sense. This presence in the school also strengthens our school and community relationships.
Our ultimate goal is to transform public education, so that all children are graduating from high school ready for college, work and civic life in the 21st Century.",,,"55 Exchange Place

Approximately 70 of SUSâ residents with mental illness have a history of substance abuse and at any given time, approximately 38 will be actively using. SUS data also indicated that substance abuse adds to the factors associated with chronic disease; factors that include poor nutrition, poor self-care, addiction to tobacco and non-engagement in needed treatment. SUSâ residential demographics also indicates that a large percentage may be undiagnosed or at risk of developing serious and preventable conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, HIV, and early detection of colon, breast and prostate cancers._x000D_
_x000D_
SUS investigated the large number of serious medical emergencies and hospitalizations among its consumers; yielding information indicative of poor medical follow-up and even poorer engagement and communication between consumers and their medical providers. In response, SUS carried out an aggressive, progressive strategy that implemented several new initiatives that included the institution of our Wellness programs. _x000D_
_x000D_
SUSâ Wellness programs address the health needs of the whole person (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual). By focusing on personal strengths and quality of life issues and using evidence based practices, such as Care Coordination and Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment, individuals reduced the number of emergency hospitalizations; reduced substance use; increased adherence to mental health and medical treatment; increased participation in weight loss programs; increased attendance in NA groups; increased independent living skills; improved family relationships; and overall improved social connectedness.",,,"483 Albany Avenue

As with funds provided by other New York City Council members, your grant will support essential SAGE programs and services in your district and citywide. Two-thirds of our clients are low income or poor, with annual incomes of 20,000 or less. Because SAGE offers most of our programs and services for free, we incur significant overhead in delivering these services, including rent, utilities, and other-than-personnel expenses. Member item support is particularly useful in helping us meet these expenses, many of which are not covered by private sources such as foundation grants.
 
SAGE is the nationâs oldest and largest non-profit organization providing direct services and advocacy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults.  Since 1978, SAGE has pioneered social services, congregate services, and community building programs that tangibly improve the quality of life for LGBT older people in New York City. Likewise, our education and advocacy programs have raised visibility and awareness of LGBT aging concerns among mainstream providers, thus making key services more accessible for an underserved population that has endured a lifetime of discrimination. 

SAGE offers the most comprehensive slate of direct services for LGBT older adults in New York City, and our constituents in every district in the city.

We hope you will consider joining your fellow New York City Council members by generously supporting SAGE through member item funding in FY11-12.  Your support is vital in helping us fulfill our mission of ensuring that the marginalized and disenfranchised older adults in New York Cityâs LGBT community will age with dignity and respect.  Thank you for your consideration.",,,"305 7th Ave

At this point, we cannot keep up with the demand for emergency food. In order to accommodate the increase in people, we have gone from being open 2 hours on Thursdays to being open the entire day.

Participation in QAX events culminates in the QAX 2012 four-day multidisciplinary, multi-platform festival celebrating the rich and distinctive intersection of arts, culture, entertainment, and marketplace offerings that exists in neighborhoods along the No. 7 and by extension, the N, and R train lines (Long Island City to Flushing and including points in between like Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside, Jackson Heights and more), connecting to the E and F train lines extending the QAX community  to the neighborhoods of Forest Hills to Jamaica.

As merchants and artists build relationships at our QAX Boot Camps and Mixers throughout the year, they learn how to work together to increase their visibility via established and emerging marketing tactics, from painting on building walls to using social bookmarking sites. Boot Camps are designed to provide hands-on training and will take place October -May.  The programâs ongoing community development initiatives will culminate in the Queens Art Express Festival, a borough-wide multi-media art exhibition drawing more than 20,000 consumers and cultural visitors to Queens over four days in mid-June 2012. These initiatives are designed to build dynamic and innovative collaborative relationships between cultural organizations, merchant groups, artists and individual businesses.

We provide the tools that help communities build better parks for better neighborhoods. New Yorkers for Parks (NY4P) achieves its purpose through an integrated framework of advocacy, research and a coalition of parks, open space, recreation, advocacy and civic organizations. 

NY4Pâs advocacy promotes transparency and public participation in parks policy decisions. We advocate for equitable resources for New York Cityâs neighborhood parks, testify frequently at public hearings related to parks and open space, and meet regularly with the members of the City Council Parks Committee. In addition, NY4P opposes parkland alienation, the taking of public municipal parks for private uses. Supported by a volunteer legal team, NY4P pushes for legislation at the state level that will protect communities from the negative impact of alienation and for mitigation when alienation does occur.

NY4P conducts research and issues reports and recommendations on critical issues related to parks development, management and sustainability. Our signature projects include the City Council District Profiles, which document parks and open space in all 51 City Council districts, and the Report Card on Parks project, an independent assessment of park and open space conditions. In addition, because the City has no master plan for the improvement and expansion of parks, NY4P created the Open Space Index, a set of 15 âtargetsâ for open space, based on extensive research and best practices. 

NY4P maintains constructive relationships with a coalition of nearly 300 neighborhood parks groups and conservancies. We organize an annual Parks Advocacy Day for this coalition to meet with elected officials, network with each other, and attend seminars on timely parks issues. In addition, many of our coalition members work with us on the Daffodil Project.",,,"55 Broad Street

It is more cost effective than full-blown case management, which many clients are not eligible for and is not readily available at the point of crisis. Case workers connect clients to benefits/entitlements, financial assistance, emergency food vouchers and packages, clothing, legal assistance, employment assistance, etc. 
This grant will pay for staff that will help 200 individuals directly and leverage additional private and philanthropic funds that will go directly to the clients. Without this staff we cannot get the clients this leveraged funding.

Now, under the new leadership of Artistic Director Alan Pierson, the Phil aims to establish deep, long-term connections with multiple Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Brighton Beach. We will do this by way of Junctions, a new flagship series of permanent, community-based music and arts residencies. We respectfully request Councilman Recchia continue his partnership with us by contributing 10,000 toward the Philharmonicâs education and community programs in FY12._x000D_

In November 2011, Junctions will launch in Brighton Beach with a full Brooklyn Phil performance at the Millennium Theatre, with a full orchestral performance of scores accompanying historical and contemporary Russian cartoons.

The Philharmonic seeks the Councilmans support for education and community programs that will compliment Junctions, including Family Works and a relocated and re-focused Music Off the Shelves. In Brighton Beach, Family Works will focus on cartoon and music creation, while the Brighton Beach Music Off the Shelves concert will feature writers well-known to the Russian community.

In addition to new Junctions programs, we seeks Councilman Recchiaâs renewed support of the Philharmonicâs music and arts education programs serving the 47th district. Currently, we are able to present concerts to more than 160 residents at the JCH Bensonhurst and Shorefront Senior Centers.

We believe that if every teacher uses technology in the classroom and students in low-income schools have access to home computers, the entire learning experience will be improved. Inspired by the limitless opportunities to learn through technology, the Comp2Kids program was initiated in 2002 and distributes free computers and training to middle school students and their families. In 2009, Comp2Kids launched the 20,000 Children by 2012 Campaign. This campaign seeks to connect 20,000 families to technology by 2012. In 2010, 3,000 families were served in 27 Title I middle school schools in New York.

The Illuminating Artists - New Work Series provides a diverse group of artists from the district an opportunity to present their works in progress before an audience and then afterwards sit with the audience and have an open discussion about the work they have just presented.  It creates a dialogue between the community audience and the artists and helps to develop their writing.  It has 4 different components: One Woman Standing - female solo work; One Man Talking - male solo work; Notes from a Page - full length ensemble musicals; and Well Noted Shorts - short form musicals.This season over 200 artists participated and brought their work to over 2000 community based audience members.  The Eatfest gives a chance for emerging playwrights to develop and premiere one act plays from 10 minutes to 50 minutes in length.  For many of these artists, it is their first time having their play seen on a New York stage.  Each season 10 to 20 plays are developed and produced and also emerging directors and actors collaborate with the playwrights to birth the plays.  An Eatfest usually involves at least 100 district NYC artists that come together to premiere their work.  Most of these diverse artists do not have the means to develop and premiere their work.

dance residency at PS 321 or MS 447 in District
33. Funding will provide a dance program
serving approximately 200 public school
students from low and middle class income
brackets, culminating in final school
performances reaching 500-800 students,
school administrators, teachers and parents.
Recent studies show that dance experiences of
this nature are extremely effective in providing
not only a physical outlet for teens, but
improving academic performance, building
confidence, reducing obesity, and improving
SAT scores. Dancewave has witnessed these
benefits first-hand: our company members
have a 100% college acceptance rate and many
receive scholarships to top-tier universities.
Unfortunately, an increasing number of NYC
public schools lack arts programming, physical
education classes, or gymnasium space, and
only 8% of NYC elementary schools provide the
level of arts education mandated by the state.
With budget cuts forcing a massive 20% layoff
of public school arts teachers next year, Council
support is vital to filling this gap. Dancewave is
a licensed DOE vendor with a strong, 10-year
track record of bringing professional dance
teaching artists to teach dance in the public
schools (Sunset Park Headstart, P.S. 172, IS
125, MS 390, PS 106, MS 447, PS 315, PS 321,
PS 107, Canarsie HS, Urban Action Academy,
and P.S. 133). We have personal relationships
with both MS 447 and PS 321, and can offer
dance residencies in a wide range of dance
forms that can be tailored to any age. Past
programs include: Hip Hop, African, Salsa,
Swing, Jazz, Tap, Creating Peaceful
Communities (integrated yoga program for first
grade), Modern (Graham technique and more),

The Lower Eastside Girls Club requests funding to sponsor a Social Justice Training Program for Manhattan teens that focuses on grassroots points of entry and civic engagement opportunities for youth. This program will create a city-wide youth council by training 2 teens from each of the 12 community board districts in Manhattan Ã¢â¬â for a total of 24 trainees. Teens representing the geographic areas of the boards will be encouraged to attend a range of community board and CBO meetings in order to understand the local nature of urban politics. Adult allies from each board will be recruited to mentor the student observers at these meetings.In summer 2012, the 24 initial students will participate in a summer camp intensive at a retreat center in upstate New York where they will plan for a year 2 expansion of the program.

They have never been exhibited publicly before, and the items are of significant historical value.

In December, 2009 the Trustees of Sailors Snug Harbor  designated the Noble Maritime Collection as the stewards of its prestigious collection.  All of the items were part of the furnishings of Sailorsâ Snug Harbor, and many were gifts to the retirement home by prominent members of the community.  Sailorsâ Snug Harbor is the first charitable institution of its kind established in this country, and the collection reflects what life was like for residents while the home flourished from 1831, when the first building opened, until 2009, when the home closed. The return of the collection to Staten Island is of signal importance to the Staten Island community, which remembers Sailors Snug Harbor with respect, admiration, and affection.

Summer Leadership Institute (SLI): A summer job program where 6 teams of up to 15 youth each spend 7 weeks working with artists and community partners, learn job skills, examine local issues and create public art on a local topic. Upcoming projects include a mural at Brooklyn House of Detention partnering with NYC Dept. of Corrections, Court-Livingston-Schermerhorn BID and Hersha Hospitality group are both special sponsors, and a mosaic at PS164 through the Trust for Public Land. 

Teen Empowerment Mural Apprenticeship (TEMA)âYouth create public art for community organizations. Two groups meet weekly throughout the school year. Current programs are creating a mural for Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park and a mural for the DOT in Downtown Brooklyn.

Voices Herâd Visionaries (VHV)âYoung women conceive and create works of public art that reflect issues of concern to girls and women. This program is both after-school and part of the SLI. This yearâs project explores how relationships are affected by technology.  

TurnStyle/Segueâ In partnership with the Center for Court Innovation, in Greenpoint and Red Hook, youth arrested for minor offences (e.g. graffiti and truancy) fulfill community service hours by working after school with our staff and artists. Upon graduation from TurnStyle, youth can join our Segue program in which they learn the necessary skills for participation in Groundswellâs art-making programs. 

Portfolio DevelopmentâAn after-school program in which youth from other Groundswell programs complete a portfolio of work to strengthen their post-secondary applications.

The Young Adult Program currently supports more than 70 HIV positive young people each year, many born with the disease, as they transition from adolescence to young adulthood.

The Young Adult Program offers psychosocial and psycho-educational group support and social and recreational opportunities.

The goal of the Court is to use positive peer pressure to ensure that young people who have committed minor offenses pay back the community and receive the help they need to avoid further involvement in the justice system. Part of the Red Hook Community Justice Center, the Youth Court handles cases involving young people, ages 10 to 18, who have been cited for low-level offenses, such as vandalism, fare evasion, assault and truancy.
_x000D_
The project helps young people avoid criminal records while simultaneously holding them accountable for their actions by requiring them to pay back the community for their offenses. Sanctions include community service, letters of apology, or skill building workshops on topics like conflict resolution and goal setting. Youth can also be linked to job training and after school programs so they can avoid further disciplinary action in their schools and communities._x000D_

To date, over 480 young people have served as members of Red HookÃ¢â¬â¢s Youth Court. In 2010, the Court heard 152 cases and maintained a compliance rate of 90.
