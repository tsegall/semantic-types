Each of these academies serves as a smaller school within our building to help create and foster a nurturing environment for the students they house. We have done this by assigning each academy its own assistant principal, dean, guidance counselor, and staff of teachers. Each academy is geographically located in a specific area of the building and has its own lunch and assembly periods. In order to provide students with an opportunity to become active members of the school community, I.S. 73's Student Council has been established to enhance school spirit and to improve the overall student experience. These students are elected to one-year positions and serve as representatives of their grade level as well as their homeroom class. Student Council members are responsible for discussing school-wide concerns and activities during the year. In addition, our school provides all eighth graders the opportunity to take the Specialized High School Exam in school during the school day at I.S. 73. Kaplan provides free test prep prior to the exam for all of our students who choose to sit for the exam.","Maspeth","70-02 54th Avenue, Queens NY 11378","No","Partially Accessible","718-639-3817","is73.org","N/A","Q18, Q47, Q58, Q59, Q67","Q073A","Frank Sansivieri Intermediate School I.S. 73 Beacon Middle School Program","Composite Score","919","90","19","8","12","48","Yes","Yes","Open to students and residents of District 24",,,,,,".",".",".",,"Attendance 10%","Final 4th Grade Report Card 45%","4th Grade New York State Math Exam 22.5%","4th Grade New York State ELA Exam 22.5%",,,,,".",".",".",".",".","Q073M","I.S. 73 Spanish Dual Language Program","Screened: Language","434","64","17","13","5","25","No","No","Open to students and residents of Queens",,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,"English Language Learners (ELLs), Heritage Language Speakers of the target language, Participants of elementary school-level Dual Language and Transitional Bilingual Education programs in the target language.",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","Q073U","The Frank Sansivieri Intermediate School (I.S. 73)","Open","394","68","3","2","30","120","Yes","No","Open to 5th grade students at P.S. 16, P.S. 19, and P.S. 143 and students zoned to I.S. 61 or I.S. 311",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","Students who apply to this program will be randomly selected",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","Q073Z","The Frank Sansivieri Intermediate School (I.S. 73) Zoned Program","Zoned",".",".",".",".",".",".","No","No","Open to students residing in the zone",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","98","47","48","Maspeth High School","Long Island City High School","Newtown High School","84","1971","Gr 6-8","No","8am-2:20pm","Yes","English as a New Language, Dual Language: Spanish","Yes—Offered","No","Yes—Academic support for certain students.","Yes","Latin, Other Language, Spanish","Algebra I, Earth Science, Spanish","Sixth Grade-Elements Program: All sixth graders participate in four different types of arts courses such as Art, Dance, Drama, Band, or Chorus during their sixth-grade year; All seventh and eighth graders will have an opportunity to choose one Arts course","Before and After-School Programs; Builder’s Club (Community Service); Chess; Creative Writing; Free Kaplan Specialized High School Test Prep; Geography and Spelling Bee; Gifted and Talented Program; Honors Program; LEGO Robotics; Maspeth Town Hall; Math Team; Newspaper Club; Parent Workshops (i.e. Health & Nutrition, Adolescent Development, & Parenting Adolescents); Saturday Academy; Special Activities/Events (i.e. Dances, Twin Day, Crazy Hat Day, Law Day); Technology Club; Yearbook Club","Developmental Basketball",,"Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball","Tennis","11378","QUEENS","405","30","49302","4058611","4025030031","Maspeth","-73.893624","40.729215"

At Hamilton Grange, we believe that kids do well if they can, and it is up to us as educators, to find the best means of supporting their growth. That means we take a progressive approach to school discipline: we do not believe that punishment is a good teacher.","Manhattanville","500 West 138th Street, Manhattan NY 10031","Yes-06M192, 06M209","Partially Accessible","212-775-9600","thehamiltongrangeschool.org","B, C to 135th St; A, D to 145th St; 1 to 137th St - City College","Bx15, Bx19, Bx33, M10, M100, M101, M104, M11, M3, M4, M5","M209L","Hamilton Grange Middle School","Limited Unscreened","251","51","3","3","19","85","Yes","Yes","Open to students and residents of District 6","Priority to students zoned to or attending P.S. 192 or P.S. 325 who sign in at an event","Then to students zoned to or attending P.S. 192 or P.S. 325","Then to students and residents of District 6 who sign in at an event","Then to students and residents of District 6.",".",".",".",".","Last year, this program only admitted students from priority groups 1, 2, and 3.","Students who apply to this program will be randomly selected in the order of the priority groups listed above",,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","91","27","20","High School for Media and Communications",,,"81","267","Gr 6-8","No","8:40am-3pm","Yes","English as a New Language","No","Yes–After-School","Yes","Yes",,"Algebra I, Living Environment","Art, Chess, Choral Music, Debate, Ethics, Lego Robotics, Newspaper, Physical Education, Regents Algebra, Regents Living Environment, Service Learning, Spoken Word, Student-Directed Book Circles, Theatre Instrumental Band, Young Activists, Young Women's Literature","Boys Baseball; Boys JV and Varsity Basketball; Boys JV and Varsity Soccer; Broadway Jr. Musical Production; Chorus; Girls' Softball; Girls Varsity Basketball; Girls Varsity Soccer; Orchestra; New York City Urban Debate League; Urban Word Poetry Slam",,,"Baseball, Fitness Club, Soccer, Track and Field","Boxing Club, Cheerleading, Fitness Club","10031","MANHATTAN","109","7","22301","1084132","1019880166","Manhattanville","-73.951145","40.820953"

Additionally, our middle school students are given accelerated instruction in mathematics and science in anticipation of taking the Algebra I and Living Environment Regents in the eighth grade. And, through a wide variety of experiences, students view the world through a global perspective. Whether communicating with college students abroad or conducting research for a company like Time Inc., our students use the skills learned in the classroom in authentic ways. Students thrive in an environment that enables them to be productive citizens who respect and embrace linguistic and cultural differences. Parents enjoy a welcoming environment which encourages them to participate in the education of their children. They embrace the high expectations of our teachers, and work alongside us to foster well-rounded young adults.

Each student at our school is considered a leader and as such we expect them to adhere to the following creed: ""A Leader practices personal and academic integrity. A Leader respects the rights and property of others. A Leader will discourage bigotry, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions.

Through our advisory discussions, we support our students organizational and study skills, provide a space for students to be heard regarding social and emotional challenges, discuss current events, laugh, and play. Students also do independent reading during advisory and teachers conference with students about their books on a regular basis. Three times a year, students participate in Exploration, which is a deep, two-week study of one question. Examples include: ""Can art change the world?"", ""Is our relationship with animals ethical?"", and ""What is courage?"" Through workshops, guest speakers, and field studies, students come to their own answers. Students complete a creative project and write an editorial in response to the big question. Each exploration culminates in an exposition where students share their work with families and the community.","Downtown Brooklyn","105 Tech Place, Brooklyn NY 11201","No","Partially Accessible","718-834-6740","ps8brooklyn.org","F to York St; A, C to High St; 4, 5, R to Court St - Borough Hall; 2, 3 to Clark St","B103, B25, B26, B38, B41, B52, B54, B57, B62, B67, B69","K008L","Robert Fulton (P.S. / M.S. 8)","Limited Unscreened","429","57","6","4","15","75","Yes","Yes","Open to students and residents of District 13","Priority to continuing 5th grade students","Then to students residing in the elementary school zone who sign in at an event","Then to students and residents of District 13 who sign in at an event","Then to students residing in the elementary school zone.","Then to students and residents of District 13.",,,,"Last year, this program admitted students from all priority groups.","Students who apply to this program will be randomly selected in the order of the priority groups listed above",,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","93","61","52","Fiorello H.

As they build skills, students demonstrate their learning through collaborative, creative projects, taking a variety of roles from newscast producer to Revolutionary War spy to roller-coaster architect. We make learning challenging. At the end of each semester, middle school students participate in week-long design competitions. Instead of regular classes, students work in groups of 12 to create projects such as fashion shows, restaurants, and newspapers.

Imagine a place where your child’s creativity is tapped, their intellect is nurtured, their artistic talents are sharpened, and they are supported and happy. Welcome to M.S. 907 - a place for students to discover who they were meant to be! Our school combines standards-based academic instruction, exposure to the arts, and a projects-based approach to educate our students. And for those who exhibit exceptional academic or artistic aptitude, our Gifted and Talented program will challenge them so they can excel. Our model relies on student choice and exposure. Each semester sixth and seventh grade students will choose an arts elective (music, visual arts, creative writing, theater, and dance) to explore their skillsets. In their eighth grade year, students may narrow their focus to one specific arts connection to supplement their academics as they prepare for high school, college, and professional careers. Daily academic experiences will also be enriched for all students by authentic curricular connections to the arts. Picture it! As part of their creative arts or music elective, your child can learn to write poetry or songs to show the experiences of those they learn about in their humanities classes. Or, during dance elective, they can choreograph a jazz piece using their newfound math knowledge. As students grow at M.S. 907, they will build positive and enduring relationships with each other and the adults around them and develop their sense of self. They will also practice critical life skills such as persistence, flexible thinking, and innovation, habits of mind which will prepare them to be productive citizens in a 21st century global community.

Students enjoy a healthy balance of strong academic instruction along with opportunities to develop their strengths in technology and the arts. Community service is a staple of our school and students enjoy the rewards of helping others. One of the most coveted positions is that of a student mentor where middle school students are able to support elementary students both academically and socially. SMART Boards, digital projectors, iPads, personal Androids, and over 200 new wireless laptops ensure that our students are ready for the technology-driven future. We also have an Arts program that includes Visual Arts, Sculpture, Band, Drama and Dance. Students have individualized programming and have the opportunity to make choices in their schedule as they prepare for high school.","Sheepshead Bay","2200 Gravesend Neck Road, Brooklyn NY 11229","No","Not Accessible","718-743-5598","ps206brooklyn.org","Q to Neck Rd","B3, B36, B44, B44-SBS, B49, BM3","K206U","School for Mathematical Science: Open to Continuing Students","Open","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Continuing Students","Open only to continuing 5th grade students",,,,,,".",".",,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,,,,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",,,,,,".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".",".","99","52","49","James Madison High School","Midwood High School","Edward R.

Through the approach of the Schoolwide Enrichment Model, the staff of M.S. 890 is committed to creating an engaging, supportive, and rigorous learning environment for everyone. Students choose an enrichment cohort and work side-by-side with their peers to dive deeply into their selected content area. Through guest speakers, field trips, and authentic learning tasks, students become experts in their selected field and work towards a culminating capstone project in senior year, during which they solve a self-identified problem or question and present their findings to the community. As a result, students grow as independent thinkers and apply what they learn to devise solutions that have a positive impact on their world. In addition, we offer opportunities for students to pursue their interests in sports, music, drama, clubs, foreign language, and writing both during and after school.
