Each committee is headed by a Council Member (the Chair), includes at least five members, and meets at least once a month.

After proposed legislation is heard by its appropriate Committee, it may be voted on and approved at that Committee. If the legislation is passed by Committee, is then sent to be considered by the whole Council. Council Members are assigned to committees through a process that the entire Council votes on.

The data can be used as an approximate assessment of the locations of litter baskets tracked by the Department of Sanitation in NYC.
""Litter basket locations are subject to frequent change, for reasons that include but are not limited to: litter basket damage, nearby construction, graffiti, or regular illegal use of basket for household or commercial waste. There is often a lag time between a change in basket type or location and the reflection of that change in this dataset.

This dataset includes information of BID-owned and Privately-owned litter baskets.  Non-profit and private entities wishing to place a litter basket on a public street must receive permission from the Department of Sanitation.

"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/8znf-7b2c","DSNY Litter Basket Inventory","Locations and types of refuse litter baskets tracked by DSNY

Data is collected by DSNY in order to track basket locations.
Data is collected through periodic surveys by field personnel. DSNY digitizes the locations of litter baskets using GIS software.
Each record represents the approximate location, ownership, and physical type of a single refuse litter basket.
The data can be used as an approximate assessment of the locations of litter baskets tracked by the Department of Sanitation in NYC.
""Litter basket locations are subject to frequent change, for reasons that include but are not limited to: litter basket damage, nearby construction, graffiti, or regular illegal use of basket for household or commercial waste. There is often a lag time between a change in basket type or location and the reflection of that change in this dataset.

This dataset includes information of BID-owned and Privately-owned litter baskets.  Non-profit and private entities wishing to place a litter basket on a public street must receive permission from the Department of Sanitation. Location data for these baskets may be less accurate than for baskets that are owned by DSNY.

This dataset does not track public litter baskets placed by other City, State, or Federal agencies, notably including the NYC Department of Parks. Recycling baskets are also not tracked in this dataset.""","Yes","Department of Sanitation (DSNY)","Monthly","Yes"

Unless otherwise signed, all streets in New York City are governed by this 25 mph speed limit. Driving at or below 25 MPH decreases stopping distance, gives drivers and pedestrians more time to see each other and react, and improves drivers’ ability to avoid crashes. Pedestrians struck by vehicles traveling at 25 MPH are half as likely to die as those struck at 30 MPH. If crashes do occur, the severity of injuries is reduced a lower speeds. The information shown here was compiled by the New York City Department of Transportation for governmental purposes. The information is updated as soon as reasonably practicable. The public is advised that speed limits are subject to temporary or permanent change and that posted signage must be observed for compliance with laws and regulations.

Speed humps are generally installed on local residential (non-truck route, non-bus route locations), while speed cushions are generally installed on designated truck route locations and bus route locations.
