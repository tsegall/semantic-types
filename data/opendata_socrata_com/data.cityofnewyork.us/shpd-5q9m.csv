With this program, we are able to reach and recognize many seniors that we might not otherwise be able to wish a happy birthday. Sometimes this card is the only recognition a senior receives on his or her birthday. Every card is designed and created by you, our volunteers. These donations are incredibly meaningful in the work we do and so important to the larger DOROT community. For more information on this project, go here: <a href=""http://www.dorotusa.org/makeacard"">http://www.dorotusa.org/makeacard</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","COSTUME COLLECTIVE: Decorate Costumes for Sick & Disabled Children!","<p><strong><em>Description </em></strong><br />
Only Make Believe (OMB) brings interactive theater to chronically ill children in hospitals and care facilities. Our program exists to supplement child life and recreational therapy programs with a quality, interactive shared theatrical experience to help alleviate stress and promote a child’s normal growth and development while in a hospital setting. Every Only Make Believe performance is interactive, meaning that the children dress up in costumes and participate as characters in the performance. Every costume for the children is decorated by OMB volunteers at Costume Collectives.</p>

<p><strong>Only Make Believe can arrange a special Costume Collective volunteering opportunity for your employees in your office.</strong> At an event running approximately 1-2 hours, volunteers can join in the fun in a conference room set up with all the supplies and use their artistic, inventive, crafty skills (and Google searches!) to create one-of-a-kind costumes for our kids. Volunteers can work on one project for a few minutes or spend an hour on more elaborate projects. OMB arrives at your office with all the materials to decorate the costumes, we provide an explanation of the program and the activity, assistance and guidance as needed, and when completed, we clean up and collect all the finished costumes to take to the OMB kids.</p>

<p><strong><em>Dates &amp; Time  </em></strong><br />
Costume Collectives can be held on a date and time of your choosing, pending OMB’s availability. The activity works best when scheduled for 1-2 hours. OMB staff requires 30-45 minutes to set up and 15-30 minutes to clean up. For a recurring Costume Collective, OMB staff would be available as needed.</p>

<p> </p>","We are looking for philanthropic-minded corporate partners to volunteer to make costumes for OMB kids to wear at the shows.

<p>SBU College Prep Mentors provide program youth with the tools necessary to graduate high school and attend college. College Prep Mentors are matched with small groups (3-4 students) of SBU high school seniors as they prepare for senior year exams and navigate the college application process. Mentors focus primarily on assisting with applications, but may be called on to provide support with homework and SAT, ACT and/or Regents exam preparation. Mentors promote the importance of education and serve as positive role models in youths' lives.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> </p>

<p>Wednesdays, 6:00-8:00pm, September - June</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>

<p>Boys Prep School Building, Third Floor<br />
192 E 151st Street<br />
Bronx, NY 10451</p>

<p><strong>Commitment:</strong> </p>

<p>Mentors are asked to commit to one evening a week for 2 hours for the entirety of the school year (Sept-June). However, if a tutor would like to be more involved, he/she is always welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong> </p>

<p>South Bronx United is looking for highly motivated, energetic volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of South Bronx youth. Volunteers should have gone through the college application process themselves, with a preference for those who have already obtained a bachelor's degree. It's not expected that mentors will be experts on the process, but they should be willing to work hard to help students with finding answers and staying on track throughout the process.</p>

<p><strong>Training:</strong> </p>

<p>A orientation and training will be held before the start of the program to provide an overview of the program and start to cover some of the ins and outs of the application process. Further training will be held throughout the year to cover specific topic areas of the application process in more depth.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> </p>

<p>In addition to helping provide the resources and support to allow underserved students to thrive in school, SBU is happy to connect with your school to see if your volunteer hours can work towards school service or academic requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Tutoring:</strong> </p>

<p>The boys and girls participating in the program are also members of the South Bronx United Travel Soccer Teams. Tutors are welcome and encouraged to come out and see a game or get involved in a practice as youth are extremely passionate about the sport and its a great way to connect with them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","Mentor a High School Student Through Their College Process!","<p><strong>Become a College Mentor and Make a Difference in a High School Student’s Life! </strong></p>

<p>East Harlem Tutorial Program’s (EHTP) goal is to help prepare students with the academic skills, strength of character and social and emotional well-being to excel in high school and college, to lead in their communities, and realize their best possible selves. The College Mentoring Program is one way we work towards achieving our goal.</p>

<p>The College Mentoring Program is two-year, one-on-one program that guides high school scholars through the entire college admissions process and supports them as they navigate their first year of college.  The program’s goal is to ensure that each senior successfully applies to college, finds financial aid, and chooses the school that is best suited for their needs.</p>

<p><strong>Mentor Responsibilities:</strong></p>

<p>- Mentees apply to a minimum of 6 schools, CUNY or SUNY schools</p>

<p>- Support students as they  research and apply to at least six “best fit” colleges and at least four scholarships</p>

<p>- Support the development of their professional communication skills, including skills related to interviews and email communication</p>

<p>- Track and report scholar progress regularly in accordance with program policies</p>

<p>- Act as a role model, resource, and support system to your mentee.</p>

<p>- Support your mentee as they transition into and through their first year of college.</p>

<p><strong>Competencies of a Successful Mentor:</strong></p>

<p>- Extreme locus of control - mentor goes above and beyond to meet goals and is action-oriented.</p>

<p>- Excellent project manager - mentor is highly organized, can articulate a system for keeping track of responsibilities and meeting deadlines, and has a willingness and desire to do the research necessary to develop list of “best fit” schools for mentee.</p>

<p>- Strong influencer/motivator - builds relationships quickly, is a great listener, inspires trust, and has a strong ability to influence and motivate people to desired outcomes.</p>

<p>- Mission Fit - Passionate about EHTP’s mission of preparing students  with the academic skills, strength of character, and emotional well-being to excel in high school and college, to lead in their communities, and to realize their best possible selves</p>

<p><strong>Time Commitment:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The College Mentoring program is a two-year commitment with different requirements in Years One &amp; Two.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Year One: support your mentee with the college admissions process through weekly meetings in East Harlem (minimum of 90 minutes once per week, Tuesday or Wednesday evenings)</p>
	</li>
	<li>

"<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong> Greeters must enjoy meeting and talking with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. They must be familiar with and upbeat about the neighborhoods that they want to show. Foreign language skills are a plus, especially ASL and Spanish. We are also looking for volunteers who have a familiarity with Harlem and Bronx. It is essential that volunteers be comfortable using public transportation since it is the easiest way to get around New York City and we feel it helps make each visit to New York City even more like a slice of the daily life of a New Yorker.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> Greeters show New York City 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Each greeter must commit to a minimum of 1-3 visits per month, 4 hours per visit.</p>","Volunteer Greeter","<p><strong>Mission: </strong>To enhance the worldwide image of New York City and enrich the New York experience by connecting visitors with knowledgeable and enthusiastic volunteers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Activities:</strong> Volunteers walk visitors throughout neighborhoods in all five boroughs of New York City that they know well. Visitors are able to experience the ethnic sights and sounds with the greeter and can get a real taste of New York City and its inhabitants. Visits may include from one to six people. Benefits: There is a thrill in making new friends from all over the world. As a greeter you will be able to show off those neighborhoods you know and love. If you speak a foreign language, here is your chance to practice it with native speakers. You will be able to promote a friendly, inviting and accessible image of New York City.</p>","Greeters walk visitors throughout neighborhoods in all five boroughs of New York City that they know well.

"<p>There are no educational prerequisites either for the students or the instructors.</p>

<p>No prior teaching experience is necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Classes are limited by &nbsp;the availability of classroom space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;All classes are held on the Brooklyn College campus during the fall and spring semesters, Mondays through Fridays between 9 am and 3 pm.</p>","Teach Adults","<p>What if you could teach interested adults in an informal, non-competitive and intellectually stimulating environment? What would you want to teach if you had a classroom of interested adult learners? Several of our instructors have come up with surprising answers while others have stayed with the topics of their professional experience. </p>

<p>Brooklyn Lifelong Learning (BLL), a non-profit lifelong learning organization at Brooklyn College is recruiting volunteer teachers for the coming semesters. You can teach older adults the topic of your choice for a semster-long course, 3-week course or one-time lecture.  We invite all those with a passion to share their knowledge to participate.</p>

<p><strong>The Benefits of Volunteering</strong></p>

<p> The prime benefit to teaching on a volunteer basis, as we have heard from past instructors, is that BLL members will be in your class because of their sheer love of learning – not because they need to take it as part of curriculum. Teaching an older group has its own unique satisfactions. These groups are often more inquisitive and involved than younger students and they bring their own life experiences with them which often serves to stimulate discussions even further.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Lilia Melani of the Brooklyn College English Department describes it this way, “Why teach a BLL class? Because the students want to be there, they come to class prepared and eager to participate, they are highly intelligent, and they love ideas and learning. The classes are exciting and energizing for both students and instructor. I have never enjoyed teaching more, and there are no papers to grade! What more could a teacher ask for?”</p>

In support of this vision, DYCD's YMI Mentoring program engages youth in grades 5 through 12 to help them transition into middle and high school and become involved in their communities. Participants are provided with opportunities to learn life skills while developing positive relationships with caring adults outside of their families. More than 60 programs in DYCD-funded community centers, afterschool programs, and youth employment initiatives offer participants the chance to engage in structured group mentoring, attend outings that promote bonding and exploration of themes around success and leadership, and complete service activities that benefit their local communities.</p>

<p>To date, more than 400 NYC youth and 80 volunteer mentors have had opportunities to foster positive relationships outside of their families, and our mentees and mentors have collectively achieved more than 400 hours of service.</p>

<p>Evaluation findings:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mentoring program participants are more engaged in community center programming than their peers who are not enrolled in mentoring.</li>
	<li>The retention rate of the YMI mentoring program is higher than retention rates typically found in traditional afterschool programs.</li>

After-School Tutors work with small groups (3-4 students) of boys and girls in the South Bronx United Youth Development Program to provide homework help and support the youth in reaching their grade levels in math and the English language arts. Tutors meet with the boys and girls, ages 11-14, for 2 hours on a set day every week. Tutors work with the same groups week to week, having the opportunity to build relationships with the kids and serve as a positive adult role model in their lives.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong><br />
South Bronx United is looking for highly motivated, energetic volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of South Bronx youth.

While the program runs every school day, Academic Coaches are only asked to commit to 2 hours, one day a week for one semester. However, if a coach would like to be more involved, he/she is always welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br />
In addition to helping provide the resources and support to allow underserved students to thrive in school, SBU is happy to connect with your school to see if your volunteer hours can work towards school service or academic requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Tutoring:</strong><br />
Youth participating in the program are also members of the South Bronx United Furia Azul, Strikers, and Shooting Stars Travel Soccer Teams.

Regents Prep Tutors work with seniors within the SBU college prep program, 1 on 1 or in small groups, to assist them in completing their high school graduation requirements of which passing the NY State Regents Exams is the main obstacle. Regents exam topic areas cover the core academic subject areas (Math, History, Science, English); however most students primarily need the extra support with respect to Math, mainly algebra, and English. Tutors will work with the same student(s) week to week, providing the opportunity to build relationships and serve as positive role models in youths' lives, promoting the importance of education.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong><br />
Mondays or Wednesdays, 6:00-8:00pm, January-June</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong><br />

<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong><br />
South Bronx United is looking for highly motivated, energetic volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of South Bronx youth. Tutors should possess either strong math or English skills, and feel comfortable breaking down and explaining processes for problem solving.

<p><strong>Training:</strong><br />
An orientation and training at the beginning of service will be run for all tutors to give general guidelines, tutoring tips and to go over the specific needs of the students. Additional training and ""check ins"" will be conducted intermittently throughout the course of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br />
In addition to helping provide the resources and support to allow underserved students to thrive in school, SBU is happy to connect with your school to see if your volunteer hours can work towards school service or academic requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Tutoring:</strong><br />
The boys and girls participating in the program are also members of the South Bronx United Travel Soccer Teams. Tutors are welcome and encouraged to come out and see a game or get involved in a practice as youth are extremely passionate about the sport and its a great way to connect with them.</p>","Regents Prep Tutors work with seniors within the SBU college prep program, 1 on 1 or in small groups, to assist them in completing their high school graduation requirements of which passing the NY State Regents Exams is the main obstacle.",,"South Bronx United","/opportunities/11781","ongoing","2601 Ocean Parkway",,"Brooklyn","NY","11235","US","http://WWW.NYCLIONS.NYC","BROOKLYN","40.586552","-73.966168","313","48","370","3337274","3072390001","Brighton Beach"

<strong>The Problem We Address</strong><br />
The skyrocketing cost of college textbooks undermines the education and lives of millions of students, who spend an average of $1,300 a year on books and supplies. 70% of them cannot afford books for all their classes. 30% of them are unable to take classes they want, simply because the books are too expensive. Tacked onto student loans, the textbook costs can haunt them for years.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>We Are Going to Change the Situation </strong></p>

<p>Colleges and universities could greatly decrease the cost of textbooks by adopting ten measures, described in the petition below. We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The Petition</strong></p>

<p>Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>·       Consider the cost when selecting textbooks.</p>

<p>·       Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible.</p>

<p>·       Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market.</p>

<p>·       Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes.</p>

<p>·       Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings.</p>

<p>·       Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them.</p>

<p>·       Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks. </p>

<p>·       Have college libraries put enough textbooks on reserve for in-house use.</p>

<p>·       Support book exchanges for students to trade used books.</p>

<p>·       Establish a standing student-faculty committee dedicated to this issue. </p>

<p> <br />

<strong>A Nonprofit Movement</strong></p>

<p>Free The Textbooks is a nonprofit movement. We are glad to help you receive college credit for this internship.</p>

<p>The Mount Sinai Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention (SAVI) Program invites you to join us in eradicating sexual and intimate partner violence from our communities. New York City needs you!</p>

<p>By joining our roster of volunteer Emergency Department (ED) Advocates it is possible to have an impact. An ED Advocate is trained to provide support and advocacy for survivors in emergency departments, so they don’t have to face the difficult decisions, emotions and follow-up procedures alone. SAVI ED Advocates helped more than 500 survivors in New York City Emergency Departments last year—<strong>that’s almost 2 survivors a day!</strong></p>

<p>We hope you or someone you know may be interested in becoming a Volunteer Emergency Department Advocate. Those interested should review our application requirements and link here: <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/SAVIrecruit"">https://tinyurl.com/SAVIrecruit</a>.</p>

<p>Interviews will be held from July – October and those accepted into the program will begin training in October.</p>

There are also opportunities to perform at community events. We welcome all styles of dance!</li>
	<li>Subbing- Our teachers are great but sometimes things come up! If you want to be involved, but have a schedule that does not allow you to commit to a full year, we are always in need of dancers who can fill in and sub a dance class when the regularly schedule teacher cannot make it.</li>
</ol>

"<p>UHAB is looking for youth ages 14 to 24&nbsp;with an interest in affordable housing and oral history. Some personal connection to co-ops is preferred but not necessary.</p>","Cooperatives and Homesteading Oral History Project","<p>Affordable, limited-equity HDFC co-ops have a unique history and place in the landscape of New York City’s housing. There are about 1,100 HDFC co-ops in New York City today. These co-ops have taken different legal paths to become co-ops since the 1970s.</p>

<p>Some HDFCs started as occupied buildings abandoned by the landlords. Tenants were able to advocate for themselves through the city’s Tenant Interim Lease (TIL) program and, usually after years of training and practice in self-management, became cooperative owners. Others started out as vacant buildings, abandoned many years before. City residents in need of affordable housing began rebuilding some of these, turning crumbling structures into habitable homes through their own labor and later becoming co-op owners as well.</p>

<p>The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) was founded in 1973 to help residents take control of their housing through the cooperative model. Our organization has accumulated many pieces of history from the co-ops we’ve assisted throughout the years. As affordable housing becomes a more crucial issue in New York City than ever, we are now working to keep the memory of these co-ops’ struggle for survival and self-determination alive through the collection of oral histories.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity for youth to learn firsthand about an important and under-publicized piece of our city’s history, develop interviewing and primary source research skills, and contribute to a non-profit organization’s effort to create a living oral history archive. Participating students should have an active interest in affordable housing and if possible some connection to affordable housing co-ops.</p>

<p>Students will receive training on affordable housing, HDFCs, and collecting oral history. We will work with students to identify and recruit interviewees. Interviews will be used to inform ongoing UHAB projects, such as an exhibition on the history of homesteading and HDFC co-ops, and an illustrated book. Students will also have the chance to create a write-up or other project based on their findings. This position involves travel.</p>","This position is a research position for youth interested in the history of affordable housing in New York City.",,"UHAB","/opportunities/13495","ongoing","539 Atlantic Ave",,"Brooklyn","NY","11217","US","http://afreebird.org","BROOKLYN","40.684937","-73.979682","302","33","39","3000805","3001800053","DUMBO-Vinegar Hill-Downtown Brooklyn-Boerum Hill"

• Successful door knocking practices<br />
• Facilitation of tenant meetings</p>

<p>WSPC is seeking committed volunteers to donate their time and expertise for this free Park program. The WSPC Greeter-Tour Program provides an opportunity for interested volunteers to become an official Washington Square Park Docent.</p>

<p>This program runs during the warmer months. Docents will be expected to work a minimum of 2 shifts per month, and each shift will last 3 hours (totaling 6 hours per month). Shifts will be on Saturdays and Sundays from 11am to 2pm. Greeters will provide information about the Park and the Conservancy to visitors during their shift.

<p>Volunteers must attend and participate in the program’s orientation, as well as complete required reading on the history of the Park. Orientation sessions include lectures, workshops, and on-site tours. Orientation takes place on Saturday, April 6 and 13 (attendance required at one orientation session only).

<p>The team is looking for new advisors to volunteer their efforts <strong>to coach and mentor students</strong> in preparation for the upcoming 2019-2020 competition season. More specifically, the QCSS is looking for ""coaches"" that could assist the team in providing constructive feedback to students within weekly practice sessions throughout the season. Team members will have an opportunity to compete in any of the 11 speech catagories sanctioned by the National Forensic Association (NFA), which are: Informative, Impromptu Speech, Persuasion, After-Dinner Speaking, Communication Analysis, Prose, Poetry, Dramatic Interpretation, Duo, Program Oral Interpretation, and Extemporenous Speech. In addition to the 11 speech events, team members will also have an opportunity to debate in International Public Debate (IPDA Debate) and Parliamentary Debate. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the team will not only be dedicated to competing within tournaments. Team members will seek ways to contribute to their academic community by hosting speech/debate tournaments at QC and assist as mentors within middle and high school debate after-school programs throughout Queens and Long Island. </p>

<p>This is a team not measured by the number of trophies or medals won; but rather, the team will be one that is measured by the number of hearts, minds, and lives that are touched. Volunteers will assist team members in reaching their full potential.

<p>Young people have interests, passions, and the desire to deeply engage in their own learning and development. <a href=""https://griptape.org/"">GripTape</a> makes this possible by giving youth decision-making control over what and how they learn, small grants to pursue a topic they're passionate about, and a Champion to encourage them along the way. That's where YOU come in!</p>

<p>Here's what former Champion, Laura Johnson, shared about her experience:</p>

<p>""If you’d like to meet some fascinating people, then I recommend being a GripTape Champion. The youth I’ve encountered, both current and past Challengers, are kind, engaging, and much smarter than I am.........It’s been refreshing to be part of their journeys, which has been a journey of my own. I’ve learned that someone else’s energy and talent can be inspirational. I’ve learned there’s a gift that costs nothing but means everything — saying to someone, 'I believe in you.'""</p>

<p><strong>About Castillo Theatre</strong></p>

<p>Castillo Theatre is an award-winning off-off-Broadway cultural hub and home to Black theater. In nearly 40 years, Castillo has produced nearly 200 plays and musicals. Its diverse following has come to expect issues of politics, race, and sexuality to sweep across the theatre’s stage. More than mere play-producer, Castillo is broadly a sphere for creative thinking and political engagement for all.   </p>

<p>Founded in 1984, Castillo grew from activists and artists, poets and performers. Privately funding enabled the theatre’s offering of improvisation, the works of the late Fred Newman, and German avant-gardist Heiner Müller, as well as youth productions. Currently, Castillo’s producing partnership with Woodie King, Jr.’s New Federal Theatre has broadened its role as creative place-maker for diverse voices.</p>

<p>Castillo Theatre is a program of the All Stars Project of New York (ASP). ASP array of youth programs includes the All Stars Talent Show Network, the Development School for Youth, and Youth Onstage! The All Stars Project’s mission is to transform the lives of youth and poor communities using the developmental power of performance, in partnership with caring adults. In All Stars programs, people learn new performances onstage and off. They try new things, become more worldly and begin to create new possibilities for themselves and their communities. Castillo is proudly the theatre leg of this larger people-first operation.</p>
