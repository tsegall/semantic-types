Working as a data scientist requires software engineering skills  statistical understanding  and skills for understanding a new domain. More important than teaching any tooling  the program will teach students to gather data  apply statistical analysis to answer questions with data  and make their insights and information actionable. . .To ensure students walk away with a foundation of programming fundamentals  statistics  and integration of these insights into the business  we will teach students a variety of skills. Students will learn how to retrieve data through the use of APIs  SQL  and scraping. They will learn how to analyze information through use of probability  frequentist and Bayesian statistics and linear regression. Students will learn how to communicate and integrate this information by learning data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Bokeh  and the web development library Flask. . .Due to the nature of the technology industry this program focuses heavily on teaching students how to learn new skills on their own. Software development moves too quickly for any skill to remain relevant forever  and therefore students are required to work with their classmates to solve problems and use various online tools to discover new coding techniques that may not be covered in class. . .Newly enrolled students must complete the Pre-Work before beginning in-class instruction. The purpose of this preparatory work is to provide real examples of the curriculum so that applicants are fully aware of the demands of the program prior to committing to it financially.
