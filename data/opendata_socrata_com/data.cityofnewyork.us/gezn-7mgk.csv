"12DEP038U","Disposition of Land from the City of New York to Sclafani Family","The proposed project is a proposal to resolve an encroachment of City-owned property by a private land owner.  The lands in question lie within the Town of Carmel, Putnam County, and involve the proposed conveyance of a small piece of City-owned Pre-MOA land to the adjoining property owner, Sclafani Petroleum, Inc.  This property transfer will cure a longstanding encroachment of petroleum facility structures on City land. The proposed transfer is not anticipated to result in degradation to water quality in nearby West Branch Reservoir.    The Sclafani family acquired the petroleum facility property in 1982 from the Spain Oil Company.  The deed of conveyance incorrectly included the City lands within the legal description of the property.  The City lands correspond to two former paper roads identified as Depot Street and Lake Street that were never developed.  Over the course of many years the owners of the petroleum facility constructed improvements and structures onto the City property under the assumption that the City wall running along the western and northern bounds of the City property marked the edge of the property.      0.843 acres of City-owned Pre-MOA land will be conveyed to Sclafani Petroleum, Inc. for appraised fair market value and combined with their existing property (parcel 76.5-1-64.1).  The City will retain a 50 foot wide access easement over the southwestern corner of Parcel 5 to allow for continued legal access to Croton Falls Road for the DEP Operations Boat Office on the adjoining property (parcel 65.17-1-41).","Upstate","Department of Environmental Protection","https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/8214-12DEP038U"

The proposed improvements at the Travis Avenue Project site involve reconstructing the 900-linear foot, frequently-flooded section of Travis Avenue.  The roadway stretch will be raised approximately three feet above the existing grade, and the adjacent roadway embankment areas will be regraded.  Two hydraulic culverts will be installed beneath the roadway to enhance wetland connectivity, and two terrestrial eco-passages will be installed at-grade with the roadway to facilitate safe passage for terrapins and other wildlife specifies across the roadway.  A new 2-foot high chain-link turtle barrier fence is proposed on both sides of Travis Avenue to direct wildlife species within the wetland areas to the proposed eco-passage locations in order to minimize vehicular-based animal mortality.  Two existing water mainsa 12 lined-cylinder pipe (LCP) and 20 ductile iron pipe (DIP)will be reconstructed in-kind within the project extents, and portions of a 12 steel gas main will be offset below the proposed culverts and eco-passages.  All roadway, utility, and landscape work will occur within the existing 80-foot-wide Travis Avenue right-of-way (ROW).  The approach slabs of the existing bridge over Fresh Kills Main Creek will be reconstructed to match the elevated roadway grades, but no additional changes to the bridge  are proposed under this contract.  The bridge foundation, structure, parapet walls, sidewalk, and guide rail will not be affected.  The Project proposes to maintain existing roadway drainage (surface runoff) and plant native vegetation in disturbed areas adjacent to the roadway.","Staten Island","Office of the Mayor","https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/13966-19OOM002R"

"14DEP003Q","Tallman Island Crib Stabilization","The project would include the placement of stone to repair damage to the protective bulkhead at the Tallman Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The bulkhead consists of a 185 foot long, 9 foot wide concrete crib approximately 12 feet high.  The crib retains the perimeter plant access road.  The ends of the concrete crib headers have deteriorated resulting in the front stretchers falling out and loss of fill within the cribs. The proposed repair will excavate within the cribs and place rip-rap inside to prevent further erosion and failure or the bank.     		    									  The erosion of the backfill material has created a washout of material under and behind the concrete retaining wall landward of the bulkhead, and has undermined a portion of the overlying roadway to the point where it is not usable to traffic. The affected roadway is crucial to the delivery of chemicals such as hypochlorite to the Tallman Island WWTP facility. The proposed action is designed to expedite a repair that would restore safe use of the affected roadway and prevent exacerbation of the existing condition. Construction activities would take up to three weeks.       The scope of work includes the following major items:    	Clearing debris, including but not limited to timber and concrete objects, from work area  	Excavation   	Local backfilling as required  	Placing filter fabric, bedding stones and rip-rap in the areas to be repaired","Queens","Department of Environmental Protection","https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/9824-14DEP003Q"

The existing PS is a subsurface structure located beneath the sidewalk of 71st Avenue near 75th Street and the project site includes a small portion of Block 3791, Lot 120. The proposed project would expand and rehabilitate the Glendale PS and increase its capacity from 1.2 Million Gallons per Day (MGD) to 2.4 MGD per pump to ensure that it could adequately serve the drainage area during wet weather events while providing redundancy. In addition, the proposed project is designed to provide a reliable, efficient, resilient, sustainable, and low maintenance operation in accordance with the 2014 Bureau of Wastewater Treatment (BWT) Wastewater Pumping Station Design. There has been a history of flooding in the Cooper Avenue underpass indicating that the pumping station capacity may need to be increased. In addition, the two pumps at the existing Glendale PS often operate during wet weather events leaving no redundancy.     To accommodate the new electrical enclosure and space for portable emergency generator or portable emergency bypass pumping equipment, the proposed project would extend the footprint of the Glendale PS to the west where there are existing parking areas. The extended area would be surrounded by chain-link fencing to enclose the existing paved area, which will remain in its current condition. Bollards may be installed to protect the electrical enclosure from vehicles. The proposed project would maintain the existing piping layout and no new pump force mains, or stormwater drains are required. Once construction is complete, the project site would be restored to pre-construction conditions, including restoration of pavement, curbing, and sidewalks as necessary.","Queens","Department of Environmental Protection","https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/14699-20DEP019Q"

"12DEP037Q","Jamaica Tributaries CSO Improvements","The Jamaica Tributaries CSO Improvements Project would include installation of a new 48-inch interceptora bypass sewer line parallel to the existing West Interceptor. The design of the proposed interceptor would relieve the existing bottleneck that currently restricts wet weather flow to the Jamaica WWTP and, therefore, contributes to CSO events in Bergen Basin and Jamaica Bay. It is estimated that installation of the new bypass sewer pipeline to augment the existing twin 36-inch West Interceptor would reduce combined sewer overflows to Bergen Basin by 100 million gallons per year. In general, installation of the new 48-inch interceptor would require: (1) microtunneling of the new 48-inch interceptor pipe from the launching shaft to the two receiving shafts; (2) construction of launching and receiving shafts microtunneling boring machine; (3) replacement of a small segment of an existing 42-inch storm sewer under the Belt Parkway, and; (4) demolition of abandoned utilities and relocation of existing utilities that would interfere with the construction of the proposed interceptor.     The Bending Weir Installation would involve the installation of bending weirs at regulators JA-3, JA-14, and JA-6. Bending weirs are passive flow control devices designed to maintain water levels upstream of the overflow weir. There are a total of ten regulators located in the Jamaica WWTP drainage area (Figure 1). The three regulators included in the proposed Bending Weir Installation were selected due to their location in the Jamaica WWTP interceptor system. Bending weir installation within these three regulators would, unlike existing conditions, allow for full wet weather storage and subsequent reductions in CSO events. In general, installation of the bending weirs would entail (1) excavation to accommodate the bending weir equipment; (2) demolition and relocation of utilities that would interfere with the construction of the proposed regulators; (3) construction of chambers to house the bending weirs; (4) installation of the bending weirs; (5) Installation of access hatches over the bending weir units to allow for maintenance, equipment removal and visual inspection of the weirs from the street level; and (6) minor concrete repair work to return the work area to preconstruction conditions.","Queens","Department of Environmental Protection","https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/8200-12DEP037Q"

"07DEP022X","Throgs Neck Pump Station","The NYCDEP proposes to upgrade the Throgs Neck Pumping Station to ensure functionality, safety and reliability. The pumping station is located east of the intersection of Lafayette Avenue and Zerega Avenue in the Bronx. The upgrade includes the replacement of all mechanical components (influent pipes, discharge pipes, force main, piping, valves) and the creation of a new electrical building and three elevated platforms. The elevated platforms will house a new 1,360 KW emergency back-up generator (which will replace an existing 2,000 KW generator which was never subject to any air analyses) and other electrical service equipment. This replacement ensures the functionality, safety and reliability in conveying combined sanitary and storm sewage to the Hunts Point Wastewater Treatment Plant.     In order to comply with NYC Local Laws 31 and 32 and the NYC Mayors Office of Resiliency Guidelines, the new emergency generator must have an entrance elevation above the FEMA 100 yr. flood zone, plus an additional 40 inches. To raise the generator and electrical service equipment, DEP is building three concrete platforms at +18.00 elevation (NAVD88), with approximately four feet extending over the East Wall. This extension over the East Wall will result in work within the adjacent area (150 feet) of a regulated tidal wetland, requiring a Tidal Wetlands Permit from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). A tree growing two feet from the East Wall will need to be removed.  Construction activities would be within the existing footprint of the pumping station and are anticipated to begin in November 2020 and last approximately three years","Bronx","Department of Environmental Protection","https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/6869-07DEP022X"
