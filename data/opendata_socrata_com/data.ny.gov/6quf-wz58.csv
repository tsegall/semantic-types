BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older.

Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable.

The metrics emphasize improving rates of timely follow-up treatment post discharge, timely filling of appropriate medication prescriptions post discharge, and reducing rates of readmission.The BHO Medication Fill dataset is designed to assess the frequency with which individuals receiving Mental Health or SUD treatment fill an initial prescription for a mood stabilizer, anti-psychotic, psychotropic, or anti-addition medication within 30 days of discharge from a mental health inpatient hospitalization or SUD inpatient stay and refill those prescriptions within 100 days of discharge.

See links to additional data documentation (‘Additional Resources/See Also’ section) below. Data for the report come directly from returns field in the previous calendar year. Therefore, several caveats are in order: 1. The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were performed by the Department. 2. Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer’s position on the return as filed and does not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3. Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with the tax return. 4. The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5.

Chapter 390 of the Laws of 2008 created Section 171-r of the Tax Law that requires the Tax Department to produce a Brownfield Credit Report by January 31st of each year. Additionally, Part BB of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2015 amends Section 171-r to require the Tax Department to produce a supplemental Brownfield Credit Report by January 31, 2016 containing the credits claimed for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007.  The mandates require the Department to include the name of each taxpayer claiming the brownfield redevelopment tax credit, the remediated brownfield credit for real property taxes, or the environmental remediation credit, the amount of credit earned, and information identifying the brownfield project generating the credit. The Tax Department is also authorized to include any other information that it deems useful in analyzing the effects of the program.","51534","2014-01-16T19:48:00.000Z","2020-02-05T23:03:00.000Z","Government & Finance","brownfield,redevelopment,remediation,credit,tax","2753","NY Open Data","New York State Department of Taxation and Finance","https://www.tax.ny.gov/research/stats/statistics/special_interest_reports/brownfield_credit/brownfield_credit_reports_open_data.htm","Taxation and Finance’s Publication 300: https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/publications/multi/pub300.pdf","Yes","OTPA.OpenNYData@tax.ny.gov","Taxpayer","Taxation and Finance, Department of","Statewide","Yes","In instances where the credit is earned by a pass-through entity such as a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, or an S corporation, information will only be reported for the entity; names of individual members of the LLC, partners, or S corp shareholders will not be reported. See links to additional data documentation ('Additional Resources/See Also' section) below. Data for the report come directly from returns filed in the previous calendar year. Therefore,  several caveats are in order:  1.   The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were  performed by the Department. 2.   Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer’s position on the return as filed and does  not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3.   Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with  the tax return. 4.   The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what  is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns  claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. Amounts do not necessarily represent finished projects. Some of these projects may be works-  in-progress. The clean-up components are available for 5 years and the property component is  available for 10 years. 6.

Collection and testing take place across New York State (excluding New York City) from May to September, when nymph deer ticks are most commonly seen. 

Nymph deer ticks are tested in “pools”, or groups of up to ten adult ticks per pool, for the Powassan virus, also known as Deer tick virus. These data should simply be used to educate people that there is a risk of coming in contact with ticks and tick-borne diseases.

These data only provide nymph tick minimum infection rates at a precise location and at one point in time. Both measures, tick population density and minimum infection percentages, can vary greatly within a very small area and within a county. These data should not be used to broadly predict disease risk for a county.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) hosts a web-based Distributed Energy Resources (DER) integrated data system at https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/.  This site provides information on DERs that are funded by and report performance data to NYSERDA. Information is incorporated on more diverse DER technology as it becomes available. Distributed energy resources (DER) are technologies that generate or manage the demand of electricity at different points of the grid, such as at homes and businesses, instead of exclusively at power plants, and includes Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems, Anaerobic Digester Gas (ADG)-to-Electricity Systems, Fuel Cell Systems, Energy Storage Systems, and Large Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Electric Systems (larger than 50 kW). Historical databases with hourly readings for each system are updated each night to include data from the previous day.  The web interface allows users to view, plot, analyze, and download performance data from one or several different DER sites. Energy storage systems include all operational systems in New York including projects not funded by NYSERDA.  Only NYSERDA-funded energy storage systems will have performance data available. The database is intended to provide detailed, accurate performance data that can be used by potential users, developers, and other stakeholders to understand the real-world performance of these technologies. For NYSERDA’s performance-based programs, these data provide the basis for incentive payments to these sites.","387","2018-02-07T16:19:00.000Z","2018-02-07T16:19:00.000Z","Energy & Environment","chp,combined heat and power,distributed generation,dg,on site power,anaerobic digester gas,adg,fuel cell,fc,photovoltaic,pv,solar electric,energy storage,monitored performance data,es,ess","0","NY Open Data","New York State Energy Research and Development Authority","https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/","https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/Anaerobic-Digester-Gas-to-Electricity-Program",,"openny@nyserda.ny.gov","Project street address","Energy Research and Development Authority","Statewide",,"Some projects have fulfilled their obligation to send data and have stopped sending updates (the previous data is archived and available).

The mandate requires the Department to include the name of each taxpayer claiming the Excelsior tax credit, the amount of each credit component earned by the taxpayer, and any other information received regarding the credit which the commissioner deems useful in evaluating the use of the credit. In instances where the credit is earned by a pass-through entity such as a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, or an S corporation, information will only be reported for the entity. Names of individual members of the LLC, partners, or S corp shareholders will not be reported. Because the credit is fully refundable, the amount of credit earned is equal to the impact on the state financial plan. Data for the report come directly from returns filed in the previous calendar year. Therefore, several caveats are in order: 1. The data appear exactly as reported by the taxpayer. No validations or error corrections were performed by the Department. 2. Likewise, the information represents the taxpayer’s position on the return as filed and does not reflect any adjustments made either during return processing or in the course of an audit. 3. Reporting is limited to the entity earning credit as determined by the credit forms filed with the tax return. 4. The actual amount of credit claimed during the period covered by this report may exceed what is reported here. This can occur if recipients of credit from pass-through entities file returns claiming credit, but the entity has not yet filed a return. 5. The report covers returns received by the Tax Department in a calendar year, which generally includes returns for the prior year.  However, as a result of statutorily-permitted filing extensions and differing fiscal years, some returns for a certain tax year may take up to three years to be filed.

These periods relate to the general age of the housing.  Older housing can present health and safety hazards to their residents.  In addition, these groupings coincide with the presence of lead in paint, a health hazard for young children.
For dwellings visited by the Clinton County HNP, this chart displays the percent of homes built in each period by funding cycle.  For example, the first set of bars shows the percent of dwellings that were built before 1950 during each of the 3 funding cycles.  We can see that Clinton County has increased the percent of the oldest homes from about 10% in the first funding cycle to almost 30% during the current funding cycle.  Looking at the orange bars, we see that during the current funding cycle, Clinton County’s HNP has visited about the same percentage of homes built in each time period.
The counties participating in the Healthy Neighborhoods Program can create this type of chart to view trends in how they are targeting their visits.

The chart gives an indication of the ability of the HNP environmental intervention to decrease the prevalence of mice in the home.  The HNP pest control intervention involves providing products (such as traps and cleaning supplies) and educating residents about removing harborage and food for pests by storing garbage appropriately, cleaning, and repairing holes that give mice entry into the home.  In some cases, the HNP contacts local code enforcement or the landlord.
We can see that the initial visit percentages vary substantially across the across counties, which could reflect differing geography, urban versus rural target areas, and the quality of the housing stock.  Except for one county, the homes that were selected for a revisit have a lower percentage with mice homes that had an initial visit, indicating an overall reduction in the percentage of homes with mice after the HNP intervention, although mice were not eradicated from all the homes.  Oneida and Cortland Counties show no mice in the revisited homes, which could be an indication of success of the intervention and/or the selection of homes to revisit.  For Westchester County, it is possible that the homes that the revisited homes were the worst and, therefore, had a higher percentage.  These three counties demonstrate why the comparisons need to be interpreted with caution.  Because revisits are a subset of the initial visits, the comparison has limitations.

There was a substantial reduction in Albany County, but most counties are essentially unchanged which may indicate the difficulty in changing people’s smoking habits.  Three counties show no homes with smokers at the revisit, but these are newly funded counties that have conducted very few revisits to date.

The primary goal of this dataset is to provide users timely information about local influenza activity throughout the current influenza season. Although each influenza season is unique, historical data is also provided for trend comparison.

Cases are included that meet the New York State Department of Health’s (NYSDOH) standardized case definition, i.e., a positive result on any of the following influenza laboratory tests:
•	Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDT)
•	Immunofluorescence assays (DFA and IFA)
•	Rapid Molecular Assays
•	Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
•	Other Nucleic Acid Amplification tests
•	Viral Culture
Please see the overview document for more details about NYSDOH’s influenza case definition. Cases reported during the CDC-defined influenza surveillance season (week 40-week 20 of the next calendar year; October through mid-May) are included.

It is unknown how many influenza patients do not seek medical care, are not tested by a reliable assay, or are tested in settings that do not report results to ECLRS. Further, certain tests such as RIDTs have limited accuracy; false negative and false positive results do occur.   The number of laboratories reporting data to ECLRS has increased over time. However, it is not known how influenza testing practices or the proportion of all tests being performed in clinical laboratory settings have changed over time or how they vary geographically. Thus, caution should be used when comparing data such as absolute numbers of cases between seasons or counties.   Despite these limitations, the data can provide useful situational awareness (e.g., trend) information during an influenza season. Data may also be used to compare epidemic characteristics, e.g., timing or proportion of virus types, between seasons. However, comparing absolute numbers of cases between seasons should be approached with caution, as noted above.  Also, because the onset of influenza activity varies annually, caution should be used when comparing a single week’s data (or season-to-date data) to the corresponding week(s) in previous seasons as a measure of relative activity.  The number of cases reported is only one measure of influenza’s impact; information on illness severity cannot be derived from the case counts.","https://health.data.ny.gov/resource/jr8b-6gh6.json","county",,"Weekly","Data is posted weekly, during the influenza season (MMWR week 40-week 20 of the next year; October-May)",,

For this dataset, readmissions were evaluated within a 30-day time period from the discharge date of the initial hospital admission. A PPR may have resulted from a deficiency in the process of care and treatment at the initial hospitalization or lack of post discharge follow up. PPRs are not defined by unrelated events that occur post-discharge, such as admissions for trauma.
