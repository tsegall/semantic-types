Mollica  Esq. Also present were owners Robert Falcone  Jr. and Robert Falcone  Sr. of Beast Mode Racing LLC  represented by counsel Daniel Tanon  Esq.; and trainer Oscar Barrera III. Affidavits in support of Appellant�s position were submitted through Andrew Mollica by Steven Sigler  managing owner of Winning Move Stable; George Weaver as trainer for owner James Politano; Oscar Barrera III as trainer for Three Players Stable and Adam Portnott; and owner Jason Provenzano of Flying P Stables. &nbsp;    &nbsp;    Commission Member Moschetti at the hearing obtained the stipulation on the record of the parties to the facts and heard argument from counsel for Appellant and counsel for Beast Mode Racing LLC. After due deliberation  Commissioner Moschetti stated his findings and order on the record  as set forth in the transcript attached and incorporated herein  as amended by the attached errata sheet  which is also incorporated herein.    &nbsp;    The Order entered by the Commission  through its duly delegated representative Commissioner Moschetti on April 29  2021  states as follows:    &nbsp;    ORDERED  the decision of the stewards not to conduct a second shake after determining the original winner of the claim was ineligible  and to instead return Noble Thought to original owners Beast Mode Racing LLC and Robert Falcone  Sr.  is reversed.    &nbsp;    ORDERED  the stewards shall conduct a new drawing by lot among the remaining eligible claimants to determine ownership of horse Noble Thought.     &nbsp;    ORDERED  the stewards shall order immediate delivery of Noble Thought to the winner of the new drawing by lot.     &nbsp;    ORDERED  the winner of the new drawing by lot shall pay the claiming price of $25 000.00 for Noble Thought as though such winner had been determined on April 10  2021.     &nbsp;    ORDERED  the winner of the new drawing by lot shall reimburse Beast Mode Racing LLC and Robert Falcone  Sr. the reasonable and accepted cost of custody and care of Noble Thought for the time Noble Thought spent in the custody of Beast Mode Racing LLC and Robert Falcone  Sr. subsequent to the 6th race on April 10  2021 until turned over to the winner of the new drawing by lot.    &nbsp;    We are currently conducting hearings only by videoconference due to the COVID-19 health emergency. Please note  you must contact our office at (518) 388-0921 to arrange for you  including your attorney and witnesses  to videoconference from your own location.

The horse Noble Thought  owned by Beast Mode Racing LLC and Robert N. Falcone entered and ran in the 6th Race at Aqueduct Racetrack on April 10  2021. That race was a claiming race in which a horse could be claimed for a claiming price of $25 000.    2. Seven claims were entered for the horse Noble Thought. The potential claimants were as follows:    � GMP Stables LLC &amp; F Bellavia LLC (trainer Brad H. Cox);    � Three Players Stable &amp; Adam Portnott (trainer Oscar S. Barrerea III);    � Flying P Stables (trainer Bruce N.

After the race  the three stewards conducted a drawing by lot (also known as a �shake�) at the track to determine the disposition of the horse. Tokens representing each of the seven claimants were included in the drawing.    4. GMP Stables LLC was drawn as the winning claimant.     5. After the drawing  the stewards determined that GMP Stables LLC was ineligible to claim the horse and voided the claim.     6. The stewards declined to conduct a second drawing among the remaining eligible claimants to determine ownership of Noble Thought.    7. The horse Noble Thought was returned to original owners Beast Mode Racing LLC and Robert N. Falcone.    8. Appellants made a timely appeal of the stewards� decision not to conduct a second drawing to determine ownership of Noble Thought.     &nbsp;    Commissioner Moschetti will hear argument from interested parties on what result should occur based upon the facts set forth herein. Should a party wish to advocate the consideration of any additional fact not set forth herein  such party shall make a motion to Commissioner Moschetti at the hearing for his consideration  setting forth why such additional fact would be material to the Commission�s decision.    &nbsp;    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that you may be represented by counsel and present evidence and arguments on your own behalf. &nbsp;Interpreter services will be made available to deaf persons and people who are not English language proficient at no charge  but such services should be requested in writing immediately.
