Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, vocalization, increased urine production and heart disease.  This condition is being managed with daily medication.  Other treatment options may be available, including radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Periodic blood testing to monitor thyroid levels is needed.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.  An educational handout is provided.<p/><p/>2)    Feline oral resorptive lesions<p/><p/>Feline oral resorptive lesions (FORLs) usually appear as a red raised area of gum tissue alongside the tooth where the crown meets the gum line, but can also be occurring under the gum line.  To adequately and thoroughly diagnose which stage a tooth may be in requires probing and dental radiographs (x-rays).  This condition is progressive and resorption of the tooth continues until no recognizable tooth structure remains.  These lesions are very sensitive when touched, and may even cause some cats to drool or be hesitant to eat or chew.  At this time, this cat is comfortable and eating normally, however evaluation by your veterinarian is needed.  Many times tooth extraction is the only treatment possible.<p/><p/>Additional care for these conditions may be needed after adoption. Please follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>"

The best way to bond with me is to spend time with me on the floor, and shower me with plenty of greens and timothy hay! <p/><p/>I am a domestic rabbit and it is recommend that adopters keep me indoors. The nice thing about having an indoor rabbit is that I can come out of my cage for bunny playtime, in a rabbit proof area of the home. It's during this supervised playtime that rabbits often exhibit some of our most fun and interesting behaviors!<p/><p/>I would love a family who will interact with me daily to keep me active and social! When rabbits get the space and enrichment we need, we often form deep bonds with our humans!<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving rabbit who likes to take things slow.
