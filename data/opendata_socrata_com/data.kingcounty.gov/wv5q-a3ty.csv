This annual celebration recognizes the impact that Dr. King had on our community and our nation, and reminds us to keep striving toward his dream of equity and justice.</p><p>This year's program will include music, spoken word, and a keynote by Ijeoma Oluo, local New York Times bestselling author of <em>So You Want to Talk About Race</em>.
</p><p>
As a part of the 2019 celebration, county officials are inviting the public to put into words or pictures the ideas and ideals for America and the world Dr. King gave his life for. The county is looking for the public's interpretation, a photo, a work of art, or an essay, of the theme for the 2019 celebration, which is taken from a quote by Dr. King: ""I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.
