When I checked on my bird the next morning, he wasn't in the same tall tree.<p/><p/>I been walking around the apartment community every 2-3 hours with another bird hoping that he would hear and respond. I leave his cage outside for him to possibly see.<p/><p/>This morning I haven't heard him and believe he might have flown outside the community.<p/>I will post on other groups and call all animal shelters, bird shops, and show residents in my community to keep an eye out (not going door-to-door to bother my residents, but those in passing or asking if I'm looking for something).<p/>I hope that you share this post and help me find my baby. I am devastated that I saw him in a tree and gone the next day.<p/><p/>He is green and yellow so he blends in with all of these trees around me.<p/><p/>Flew out on Friday 8/19<p/>Please send me an email if you spot or have him.

My name is Pixie Cat and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on March 28, 2022 because they were possibly facing homelessness. <p/><p/>I must admit I am a bit shy initially, but being here at RASKC is just very to new to me. Just give me a couple minutes to warm up to you and I will be begging for affection!<p/><p/>Although I may be 12 years old, I have a lot of life and love still in me to give! Due to my age I may be sensitive to handling so please look for signs that I may need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)   Hyperthyroid<p/><p/>This animal has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism; excess production of thyroid hormone.  Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, vocalization, increased urine production and heart disease.  This condition is being managed with daily medication.  Other treatment options may be available, including radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Periodic blood testing to monitor thyroid levels is needed.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.  An educational handout is provided.<p/><p/>2)    Feline oral resorptive lesions<p/><p/>Feline oral resorptive lesions (FORLs) usually appear as a red raised area of gum tissue alongside the tooth where the crown meets the gum line, but can also be occurring under the gum line.  To adequately and thoroughly diagnose which stage a tooth may be in requires probing and dental radiographs (x-rays).  This condition is progressive and resorption of the tooth continues until no recognizable tooth structure remains.  These lesions are very sensitive when touched, and may even cause some cats to drool or be hesitant to eat or chew.  At this time, this cat is comfortable and eating normally, however evaluation by your veterinarian is needed.  Many times tooth extraction is the only treatment possible.<p/><p/>Additional care for these conditions may be needed after adoption. Please follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>","BLUE"

Although Reggie is ready for adoption, there is always a possibility of additional medical conditions that have not been detected or may develop in the future.  Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)  Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (FIV)- FIV is a viral infection that is transmitted between cats usually through fighting.  This is a lifelong infection with no cure.  FIV cats can have shorter lifespans, however many of them can live many years in good health with proper management and care.  Please refer to the information handout provided.<p/><p/>2)  This animal has been diagnosed as hyperthyroid.  This means that thyroid gland is producing an excess of hormones.  This disease can be easily managed with daily medication, radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.  We have also included a handout with more information about this disease.<p/><p/>3)  This animal has been diagnosed with dental disease.  They will require a dental cleaning under anesthesia and potentially need x-rays or tooth extractions.  Please follow up with your regular veterinarian to form the best treatment plan.<p/><p/>Additional care for these conditions may be needed after adoption. Please follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>","GREEN"

My name is Zobey and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on 6/28/22. I need someone who is able to provide me with company as I get used to being home alone. <p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home.<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I will do best as the only dog in my new home.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/><p/>","BLUE"
