Subject: Trash along State Road 24

I would like to bring to the attention of the Gainesville City Commissioners, the trash that often accumulates along the south side of State Road 24 between UF Health Shands and the Malcom Randall VA Hospital.

I gather that this area is sort of a “no-man’s” land with jurisdiction shared (or not shared) between the City, the University of Florida/Shands, and the VA.

I often walk from the parking garage near the corner of Gale Lemerand Dr and State Road 24 to my office in the Shands Facilities Administration Building. I am dismayed at the trash along the walking area—especially the medical related trash such as latex gloves and face masks and sadly copious cigarette butts.

Mostly recently it has been less littered, and I did make mention of the problem to someone at Shands—so perhaps some action was taken.

But what I would hope in the long term is that the entities involved would work together to provide regular clean up this area and a cooperative educational program for visitors, patients, and employees.

Because of the prominence of the UF Health Shands medical facility and the regional status of the VA, we have a lot of people from out of town visiting this area, and I would hope that the city, the hospitals, and the local community would take pride in showing visitors a well-kept public corridor.

Thank you.

"3571216","Archived","Grass (Overgrown)","Commissioner Arreola received the following e-mail from Deb Lancaster on 7/19, 7am:

Good morning.  I called yesterday afternoon and spoke with a customer service rep who advised she would transfer me to your extension.  Instead, I was sent to the voice mailbox of Adrian Santos-Hayes.  I left a message, requesting that he transfer my message to you.  In case that does not occur, I am emailing my request to you.

I reside at 4201 NW 14th PL.  I am a 64 year old widow who somehow manages to keep her yard in decent shape, which activities include mowing.  So, how it is that the City of Gainesville, with its vast resources cannot mow the grass circle on our street?  I have lived there for 41 years and the circle has been mowed regularly (every month or so) each summer.  I'm not normally a complainer, but the height of the grass/weeks is absurd.  I am 5 ft 6 and the weeds come up to my shoulder in some spots.  Of course when I checked that out, I had to wear hard, enclosed shoes, for fear of snakebite. And who knows what other wildlife is lurking amongst the overgrowth? The neighborhood kids, who sometimes use that circle for touch football or other activities, are unable to use it due to the jungle-like conditions.  If the City waits much longer, it's going to need a bush-hog.  By the way, I have observed the mowing many times in the past.  It typically takes no longer than 15-20 minutes to accomplish.  Of course, in its current state, it may now take much longer to mow.

Kindly forward my request to the appropriate department.  FYI, I have made two telephone calls to Public Works in the last few weeks, and have been told ""it's on schedule"" to be mowed.

Thank you for your consideration and assistance.

Subject: Mixed use development at 43rd St and 23rd Ave

Mayor Poe and the Gainesville City Commission - I’m not sure I have ever written to a local politician before - usually state or federal office holders, but I feel compelled to write after reading the Mayor’s comments in today’s paper about high density development leading to less traffic and how the 225 apartments or units will be lived in likely by people without cars. Thus, in your mind, another reason traffic will not get worse at that intersection - 43rd  St and 23rd Ave. I’m sorry - but aren’t you part of the same commission trying to cut down on student deaths on University Ave - near 13th - not exactly a low density area - and aren’t you getting ready to spend money to re-do that section of the road - 13th and University Ave to improve traffic flow and make it safer? And downtown - on Main Street - again not exactly a low density area and traffic moves at a crawl - one lane each way - but no lessening of traffic. Who ever gave you the info that high density areas have less traffic? The source  obviously has a study that shows that, but my experience in medicine has proven that one can cite a study that supports just about anything one believes in or wants to do. Data needs to be analyzed carefully. 

And as for the mayor’s  comment about people living in apartments  there not having cars - well, not having a car is workable if work is nearby or if bus service takes you near your work place - but usually if it is an apartment - with more than one occupant - at least one person is likely to own a car which will transport not just themselves but others as well. I don’t know if you have noticed very many bicyclists heading off to work on Gainesville streets - a few east of Waldo Road and of course UF Students.

Hello:

I am not sure to whom I should direct this question/concern, so will ask our Gainesville City Commission for direction.

As Background:
I am a long-time home-owner in the Woodland Terrace neighborhood in Gainesville, Florida - an old established subdivision of small, single family homes off University Avenue.  It is our understanding that a large, multi-family apartment complex (192 units), to be known as Royal Park Apartments, is planned for development on currently landlocked acreage behind the Royal Park movie theater and adjacent to the Woodland Terrace and Golf Club Manor Subdivisions (a misnomer, since there is no Golf Club anywhere nearby!).  

I could not find much local information regarding the proposed project, so I am not certain of the actual development plan.  However, I did find some information on the internet regarding the issuance of tax exempt bonds to finance the project, which indicates a desire to develop the acreage, See:  

 - https://floridahousing.org/docs/default-source/data-docs-and-reports/boardpackages/2021/july-30/consent-items/MMRB_Ex_G.pdf 
 - https://floridahousing.org/docs/default-source/aboutflorida/notice-of-public-hearing/notice-of-public-hearing---royal-park.pdf?sfvrsn=95adf77b_2

It is our understanding that there is some difficulty in accessing this acreage and various proposals are under consideration regarding future traffic flow - and that one proposed route may be via an access road to be built at the meeting point of NW 5th Ave. and NW 36th Dr., on a small lot located between two existing houses. See:
- https://qpublic.schneidercorp.com/Application.aspx?AppID=1081&LayerID=26490&PageTypeID=1&PageID=10767&Q=1955578386&KeyValue=06496-000-000

This possible route to the Royal Park Apartment complex would significantly increase the traffic flow on NW 5th Ave, and could turn what is now a relatively quiet, speed-bumped neighborhood road, into a heavily","2021-11-15T19:36:00.000","2021-12-03T20:55:00.000","2021-12-03T20:55:00.000",,"2021-12-03T20:55:00.000",,"20160","14",,"Clerk","C Walsh",", Gainesville, FL",,,,,

      This speed bump is a must to stop cars from cutting through this residential neighborhood and for the safety of the neighbors.

The apartment was not cleaned at ALL prior to our arrival, and now poses multiple health risks, as the leasing office staff does not do anything to fix the situation. When I complain, they laugh and say they can't do anything about it. Today, a cleaning crew arrived (10 days after my initial complaint) but to my surprise, they were instructed to only clean the two rooms that currently have no occupants.. Not my or my roomates room, or the apartment in its entireity. The crew themselves commented on the apartment's stench, and upon opening the compartment that shields the AC, they noticed that the AC was covered in black mold, the filter included, and also had substancial corrosion. The cleaning crew even refused to stay in the apartment for more than 10 minutes in fear for their health. There are also multiple wasp nests right outside of our door, which we have also complained about and have had nothing done about the matter. I have uploaded a photo of the AC unit, but have other photos of the apartment's state when we moved in.","2016-08-30T16:44:00.000","2020-08-11T19:03:00.000",,,,,,,,"Code Enforcement Department (Primary)","Amanda Menezes","1000 SW 62 BLVD","29.6423663","-82.3989229","POINT (-82.3989229 29.6423663)","2","3"

Since this bucket has been sitting here since at least February, one can reasonably assume that it has been abandoned and since it goes to a motorized piece of equipment, one can assume it falls into the Section 13-171 of City of Gainesville Code of Ordinances  and can reasonably be considered a part of a vehicle, therefore in violation of Section 13-171(b), which states:  It shall be unlawful for the owner or occupant of a residential building structure or property to utilize the premises of the residential property for the open outdoor storage of any blight-inducing materials such as abandoned motor vehicle or part thereof including tires, icebox, refrigerator, stove, or other appliances, planks, timbers, glass, or other building material, building rubbish, packing material, barrels, bottles, cans, boxes or similar items. Failure to comply with this subsection shall be a major violation.","2018-04-25T13:01:00.000","2018-09-27T23:09:00.000",,,"2018-05-01T11:24:00.000",,,,,"Code Enforcement Department (Primary)","An anonymous SeeClickFix user","4322 NW 20TH TERR","29.69456","-82.350042","POINT (-82.350042 29.69456)","1","2"

"2556839","Acknowledged","Tree/Limbs (Private Property)","There is a down tree limb on Pickwick Park/Pickwick Circle property. It has been down for over 1 week, possible over 2 weeks (I cannot recall the exact date of the storm that brought it down). I have been in touch with Pickwick's management agency, University Management. They deny that the tree limb is on their property and claim that it is instead on Brighton Park property. Brighton Park management denies it is on Brighton Park property. In the meantime, nothing is being done about the tree limb and it remains a hazard. I have downloaded the plats for all three players in this area (Brighton Park, Pickwick Park, and Pickwick Circle), and I am sure the tree limb is on Pickwick property. I have attached the Pickwick Circle plat with a yellow dot denoting where the tree limb has fallen. I will also upload a photo in a subsequent report.

This bottleneck is hard for pedestrians and bicycles to navigate, and impossible for wheelchairs.  Please consider moving the yield sign to another location rather than the middle of the sidewalk  (look at some of the other corners at this intersection for other alternatives) and if you could ask the construction firm to keep their fencing off the sidewalk or minimize it, that would also help immensely.  They have been very responsive about requests before and are doing a great job with the construction in a heavy traffic area for the most part.

I’m a law student at the University of Florida. I went to Balls on Friday and couldn’t help but notice that the bar did not appear safe. As you’ll see in the video, the ceiling appears like it’s going to buckle. I’m not sure if this is because of the weight of people upstairs at Grog, or if it’s because the building is structurally deficient. One of my friends, a civil engineering Ph.D student at UF, was very concerned. I don’t think the video does justice, but in light of the building collapse in Surfside, I wanted to pass this on. Maybe the building is okay, I just thought the city might want to see this. Thank you!","2021-07-18T16:40:00.000","2021-12-31T19:33:00.000","2021-12-31T19:33:00.000",,"2021-12-31T19:33:00.000",,"171360","119",,"Code Enforcement","Cole Thomas","1720 W UNIVERSITY AVE, Gainesville, FL","29.6522754","-82.3454","POINT (-82.3454 29.6522754)","1","4"
"1903135","Archived","Grass (Overgrown)","I reported this property 1 1/2 years ago. The owner did mow the lawn and kept it up until he moved. The house was foreclosed on and some repairs were made on it. It now has a sign that a rental agency based in Orlando is posting it for rental. However, I found the agency hard to find on the Internet, but I did finally locate it. Do not know who owns it now, the mortgage company  or an individual. While it was being foreclosed, etc. a team of people came about once a week to mow. Since the agency put the sign up, no mowing has been done since early June. A notice still on a front window has the phone number for the group doing the yard work. A truck is parked in the driveway, but it belongs to a guy across the street who just started parking it there about 2 weeks ago, it may have been vandalized, etc. when parked at the business.  Not sure if this will work, but here is the house on the Internet.

The neighbor to the south has walked into the backyard and he said he saw a hole in the eaves where squirrels are getting into the attic. Birds in my yard chased a 3-foot snake out of my backyard into its overgrown backyard. BTW there is a lot of skunk vine and poison ivy in the backyard, so be careful.

I will be gone a bit of time tomorrow morning, Sept. 10, running errands. Feel free to go into my backyard to look into the yard south of me if you want to avoid poison ivy.

We have notified our landlord of these issues and have been met with rudeness and reluctance to fix things. It took our landlord over two years provide us with heat since the date of our occupancy despite being required to by state law. It was finally installed this week and then unit is still missing a filter box or place to filter the incoming air. Right now, we have had to tape a filter to the outside of the a/c unit in order to filter the air so it doesn't destroy the unit. Our roof was leaking for 8 months until it was finally fixed despite numerous requests. These issues the landlord was informed about in writing about numerous times. We are currently experiencing issues (in addition to the issues with a/c) with the floor tile cracking in the kitchen and living room; the provided washer/dryer not working; the faucet in the kitchen sink constantly sticking; and the palm tree pushing on the roof by our bedroom. Our landlord has been made aware of all these issues and has done little to ameliorate the situation. When we informed our landlord of these things and other issues with the property, we are met with rudeness and accusations of “breaking things” that have been affected by normal wear and tear and the age of the appliances. For example, he accused us of breaking the dish washer by placing ""a foreign object"" in the dishwasher drain hose when there is no way we could have done that. We possess neither the skill or the will to deliberately destroy any appliance including a dish washer. The object found, according to the plumber, was a hard place screw cover that is most likely a part of the machine itself. And he accuses us that we are harassing him by contacting him during normal business hours or upon emergency (as per the requirements of the lease). We live in the Historic Duckpond neighborhood. And he is well aware of what is required to maintain this property.

This is a public right of way that is being used as a personal driveway by owners of property tax lots # 9025-3 and 9025-2.  There is no concrete apron at the end of this alleyway and traffic is causing weathering and erosion that results in sand and debris being washed south down into NW 17th Street then west down NW 12th Rd and eventually into the creek system.  We have asked that the City place a truck load of crushed aggregate or stone here to fortify the soil so that it does not erode.  The original request was bounced between City and County and EPA with nothing being done.   Residents in this area pay stormwater fees but are the ones that have to go out and clean up the sand and other sediment that washes out from these areas after each storm.  We don't want gutter and storm sewer engineered solutions but the City should be able to come in with low cost, low tech solutions that  fix the problem (like, as we have already suggested before, placing gravel at this location).

Based on known engineering standards these exhaust fans would be thermostat controlled for an extreme heat emergency within the parking structure. They are clearly not operating as designed. The Standard did not inform the residents of Jackson Square these would be placed there and actually provided drawings that do not show them. These fans clearly violate several noise and design codes and should be shut down immediately. They are causing anxiety and decreased property value.  The City will be co-liable by allowing this to continue.

"7321481","Archived","Trash/Debris (Public Property)","To whom it may concern, 

Hello. I am currently a resident living in a tent at Dignity Village, and I would like to make a request concerning a recent change in waste management. 

My tent is located in the first section of the southwest corner at Grace Marketplace. There is a road that circles around Grace, and as you are heading south on the road, just before you turn the corner to go east, there is a designated area at the edge of the lot, which contains 3 porta-potties and a cube shaped dumpster with two lids. Both the porta-potties and the dumpster are situated a minimum of 50-60 ft away from any tents. Or, you might say - none of the residents have chosen to set up their tents within 50-60 ft of the designated bathroom and dumpster area. This seems to be a sufficient distance for everyone. However, on Friday morning, January 31st, the dumpster was removed, and a large rectangular dumpster with no lids was placed right in the middle of the main tent area, within 15-20 ft of several of the tents, including my own. 

Although I do not contribute to this myself, it is an unfortunate truth of this type of living environment that the dumpsters will tend to contain urine, feces, and other raw waste, such as old meat. Because of its close vicinity, and because it does not have any lids, I am able to smell the waste from my tent, and there are flies whenever I walk outside my door.

In addition to this, it causes an excess of noise, which has made it difficult for me to sleep at night. When the dumpster is moved from 60 ft away (where it was) to 15ft away (where it is now), it may appear to be a subtle difference to an outsider, but it causes a sound increase of 12db, which more than doubles the perceived volume. Whenever anything is thrown into the dumpster, it usually creates a loud thud sound, which I can not only hear, but I can feel as well, as it shakes the ground. 

I do understand that living in a tent, I am not in a position to expect the same standards as someone living in a house or an apartment, but I would like to respectfully request that the dumpster be moved to its previous position, or to another suitable position that would be located 50 or more feet from any of the tents. And preferably I believe it ought to be the kind of dumpster with lids, so that the flies and smell may be better contained. 

In regards to sound, I do not expect total quiet, and accordingly, I wear earphones literally 24hrs/day. Under normal conditions, the headphones are sufficient for blocking all or most of the sound from the surrounding area. But with the dumpster in its new location, I am able to hear trash being thrown several times per hour, and as I said, this occurs after 10pm at night as well.

Another problem is that the dumpster tends to create debris, and attract scavengers. For example, currently there is a heap of scrap tent materials between the dumpster and my tent. The accepted etiquette here is for anything which may potentially be of use to be left outside the dumpster. Additionally, there are people who regularly check the dumpster for these types of things, and there are also people who regularly go into the dumpster itself in order to retrieve aluminum cans and other items. 

Since the dumpster has been placed in its current position, it has been extremely disturbing for me. If it is possible to move the dumpster to where it was previously, and to return to the type with lids, I would be very grateful for your concern. 

Thank you. 

David Cole Arnold

"4846753","Archived","Other","With the start of the fall semester, I have noticed an uptick in visitors to Alfred A Ring Park, many of whom are dog owners with off-leash dogs. Yesterday in the park, my on-leash dog was chased and pounced on by an off-leash greyhound whose owner apologized for her dog’s natural behavior rather than her own irresponsible behavior and inability to control her dog. This is just one of several encounters my dog and I have had with off-leash dogs in the last few weeks alone; rarely have we come across an off-leash dog that did not either aggressively bark at us or come up to my dog with the hope of following her through the park as we went on our way. I am writing to ask if you can have a park ranger visit the park and remind visitors with off-leash dogs of Alachua County Ordinance Section 72.12. I am also wondering if the city can post some simple signage about the ordinance and its enforcement (perhaps fines involved) so that visitors with dogs will at lease become educated. Thank you!","2018-08-28T14:39:00.000","2018-09-11T09:53:00.000","2018-08-28T14:46:00.000",,"2018-09-11T09:53:00.000","6","19874","13.80138888888888888888888889",,"Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Department","City of Gainesville Neighbor","1801 NW 23RD AVE","29.6744603","-82.3477365","POINT (-82.3477365 29.6744603)","1","2"

I banged up my left arm, hip and my head hit (thank goodness for my helmet), I only got scrapes, scratches and bruises.  I am okay but my bike took a significant amount of damage to the rear wheel, tire, derailleur and chain.

This bus-stop is right at a curve in the road. This could easily have been avoided if there were some bollards on the curb at the bus-stop, so that even if cars lose control on the curve, they wouldn't get on to the sidewalk. Since the bollards are on the curb, it wouldn't affect vehicular movement on the road nor restrict pedestrians on the sidewalk. I've contacted Gainesville Public Works Department (service request # 5836) and said they would approve bollards if it was required. Kindly look into this.

I'm not sure I'm emailing the right person, but I want to report that I have seen, on several occasions, people (student aged) either fishing or touching wildlife at Lake Alice (across from the bat houses). On one occasion, about a week ago, I saw a boy catch a large bass fish, and on another occasion I saw student-aged people standing really close to a gator and trying to take a picture with it, while also yelling and gesturing to the gator. There are no signs in the area about respecting the wildlife (besides just alerting people to the potential presence of gators), and there are no signs about not fishing whatsoever. Since I believe this is a conservation area, I was hoping to have some signs put in the area indicating that these are wrongful behaviors, and potentially have an officer of some kind patrolling the area to ensure the wildlife wont be disturbed. If this has not reached the right person, please put me in contact with the proper area.

"5736635","Archived","General Code Issue","A nearby neighbor has mulched and planted banana trees (possibly to discourage dogs) between the curb and City easement, as well as installed 15 foot boards to (possibly) support the banana trees.  There was an accident in that area a year ago, and resident is afraid of the possibility of another.  She reported situation to Codes Enforcement.  She was told the issue was a building permit matter.  However, Building Permits informed her they only do new construction.  In addition, the neighbor informed Building Permits they were putting in a garden.  Even if true, they cannot plant a garden on City property.  This resident has cancer, and feels she's being given the run around trying to get someone to take action on this.

"1885959","Archived","Residential Rental Maintenance","The AC in my unit has been down for roughly 10 days now. I've tried contacting the sales manager, general manager, and office employees multiple times without a single response. They seem to be ignoring my situation. Both my roommate and I have sent complaints and we haven't heard back from them regarding the issue. I finally get my attorney involved last week and they told me that they would have the AC fixed by last Thursday or Friday or would add an extra portable AC unit. However they failed to respond after that. Then I contacted the general manager on Friday asking about the AC and he replied that he'd have it fixed by the weekend, and if not he would install a window AC on Monday. It's Tuesday now and he is continuing to ignore my messages. Its summer in Gainesville FL and without AC, one cannot live in a closed space. My roommate and I have been getting sick because of the upwards of 88 degree temperature in our apartment. The maintenence crew put a ""small room"" size portable AC in our apartment and explained that it would only be a few days. It has been almost 2 weeks and this small room AC can only cool the living room. Another issue is that my roof is leaking in my apartment when it rains. Instead of coming to fix it or patch it up, the maintenance says ""its okay for now"". Many doors around the complex are always open and it makes me feel unsafe. I also have a problem with trash piling up in the garage near the trash shoots. Noone ever cleans them up so they tend to fill up one or two parking spaces. Also, the only elevator on the premises has an expired permit. Its been expired for a month now and people are using it everyday.","2015-09-01T09:31:00.000","2018-09-26T04:06:00.000","2015-09-01T10:45:00.000",,"2015-09-14T15:38:00.000","74","19087","13.25486111111111111111111111",,"Code Enforcement Department (Primary)","Chris Arsali","1720 SW 37TH ST","29.6361748","-82.378115","POINT (-82.378115 29.6361748)","2","3"

"4933087","Archived","Traffic/Pedestrian Signal","If you're traveling S on 441 and need to make a left (N) onto 121, good luck to you. The signal is incredibly short, rarely allowing even 4 cars to make the turn...and only 1 or 2 if there's a truck. Opposing traffic heading N on 441 is often clear for more than 1/4 mile while those waiting to turn are forced to wait for the short signal. Because of this, many drivers bypass the turn lane all together, continuing S and make a U-turn in front of 33 fire station. This is not optimal! The problem is, you'll go through 3 light changes to make that L turn if you're unlucky enough to have a couple of trucks ahead of you. Since my office is up 121, I make this turn at least 3 times a day and it does nothing but get worse. If you were to simply give the turn lane an additional 15-30 seconds, you'll clear the cars trying to go N on 121 without  seriously impeding traffic on 441 heading for Alachua.","2018-09-20T20:35:00.000","2018-09-24T22:20:00.000",,,"2018-09-24T07:24:00.000",,"4968","3.45",,"Public Works Department (Primary)","gatorgrabber","11807 ORIDA 121","29.7123710262185","-82.3534481559461","POINT (-82.3534481559461 29.7123710262185)","3","2"

"4533110","Archived","Other","Fire hydrant is still leaking (since June 1, 2018) on northwest corner of NE Waldo Rd. and NE 3rd Ave. Most probably caused by private contractor using the fire hydrant since mid-2017. This is an ongoing problem.

I understand Supervisor, Billy Dampier was supposed to look at the hydrant on June 4, 2018 but it is still leaking. If there's a fire and Gainesville Fire Rescue needs to use it, will the integrity of the fire hydrant caused by this continual leak affect their response?

Instead of filling every circle with plant life, which blends in with backgrounds in other locations, please consider architectural shapes like obelisks, arches, columns, lighthouses, sculptures, etc to show drivers they need to slow down. Well lit at night as well. I think filling circles with only trees and bushes blends in with backgrounds sometimes, and new residents or tourists won't slow down in time. Since this is a new and cost related idea, perhaps local arts patrons or nearby businesses could sponsor the non-plant roundabout markers?","2018-10-17T20:34:00.000","2020-08-12T00:40:00.000","2018-10-17T20:35:00.000",,"2019-01-07T15:50:00.000","0","117855","81.84375",,"Public Works Department (Primary)","Jeffknee","SW DEPOT AVE","29.6445928878328","-82.3249756863153","POINT (-82.3249756863153 29.6445928878328)","4","1"
