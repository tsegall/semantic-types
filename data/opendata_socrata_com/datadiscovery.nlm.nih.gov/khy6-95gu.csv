This webinar focuses on how pubic libraries answer this call to action by partnering with institutions, groups, and individuals in their communities to offer high-impact health programming. Based on research conducted as part of Let's Move in Libraries (2), his ongoing blog series published by the ALA Public Programs Office on partnership-driven health programming (3) , and as part of a new project focused on how libraries contribute to food justice, Dr. Lenstra will provide on overview of strategies and tactics libraries use to start, sustain, and assess partnership-driven health programming. Particular attention will be given to small and rural libraries. Topics to be covered include: Finding the time to partner, identifying partners, joining community coalitions & task-forces, and leveraging partnerships to secure external funding and resources for your library. These topics will be illustrated through in-depth examples of actual public libraries from across the country engaged in ongoing partnership-driven health programming.   Bio: Dr. Noah Lenstra, MLIS is an assistant professor of Library and Information Studies at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, and the founder and director of Let's Move in Libraries, an international initiative to get people of all ages and abilities moving through public libraries.

The University of Virginia (UVA) Health Sciences Library received two Health Information Outreach awards from NNLM SEA, located at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Over the span of 1.5 years, UVA partnered with local and regional non-profit and public organizations to create new or enhanced health literacy programming and services in the local health district. The grants were administered and partnerships developed by Lydia Witman, a UVA medical librarian who is a health literacy advocate and consumer health specialist, and who manages the hospital's Patient & Family Library. Local partner organizations included the city's mental health and wellness coalition, the regional public library system, and more.The librarian was able to support the needs of the community by helping community-based organizations identify their own needs and formulate their own solutions. Not only were organizations educated about what health literacy is and how it affects health outcomes and well-being, they were also given grant funds to complete health literacy-related work with the populations they serve.  Instead of creating a prefabricated program, service, or learning experience, the librarian listened to the needs of each organization and helped them formulate their own plans. Providing contacts and connections was also valuable; for example, one organization working with refugees and other vulnerable populations wanted to focus on creating Arabic and Spanish language translations of some of their print material; the librarian was able to provide a list of recommended translation vendors for health-related documents. The librarian was able to steer organizations toward ideal practices such as including members of the intended audience in the planning and design phases, and assessing the success of interventions.

Summary: There are many online and in-person courses available for librarians to learn about research data management, data analysis, and visualization, but after you have taken a course, how do you go about applying what you have learned? While it is possible to just start offering classes and consultations, your service will have a better chance of becoming relevant if you consider stakeholders and review your institutional environment. This lecture will give you some ideas to get started with data services at your institution.Presenter Bio: Margaret Henderson is the Health Sciences Librarian at San Diego State University Library.

The GRAF-pop function is also built into a CGI, and you can now find links on many dbGaP study records, called dbGaP estimated ancestry components, that use the CGI to display the study's ancestry relationships.

This webinar introduces the WikiCite initiative to build a database of open citations to support free and computational access to bibliographic metadata and will identify simple, high impact ways for to get involved. As experts in the intersection of bibliographic metadata, information discovery, and interdisciplinary research, librarians are a tremendous resource for this community. Currently the WikiCite citation database is being developed in Wikidata, which has also become a viable linked data hub for library collections and authority data. Citations are vital to Wikipedia's foundation of verifiability, not truth, and academic libraries are uniquely positioned to connect researchers and their outputs with the wider information ecosystem. As the backbone of scholarly knowledge, citations are also vital components of Open Science RDM strategies. Open, structured, separable citations encourage data reuse and remixing to reproduce, verify, and build on results reported in scholarly literature. In addition to access, Wikidata adds these citations to the linked data knowledge graph, supporting applications like Scholia (https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/) that generate scholarly profiles and Wikidata info cards that can be added to library systems (https://gitlab.com/denials/wikidata-music-infocard).","false","MP4 Video","YouTube Video","60","Data Science","Network of the National Library of Medicine","User; Trainer","2020-06-12T00:00:00.000","2018-12-07T00:00:00.000"
