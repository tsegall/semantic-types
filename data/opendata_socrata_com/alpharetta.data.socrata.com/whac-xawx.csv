"C2113","ENCORE GREENWAY GATEWAY","Community","The goal of the Encore Greenway Gateway project is to improve the connectivity (safety and simplicity) to the Big Creek Greenway from the intersection of Encore Parkway and North Point Parkway.  Project will provide connectivity of the Big Creek Greenway to the west side of GA 400 and introduce a gateway feature to bring attention to the greenway.  Project status meeting was held on January 10, 2022.  AECOM is working on the construction plans and Design team is communicating with Recreation/Parks/Cultural Services and NFCID regarding the selection of railing, benches, garbage cans, bike racks, etc.  A revised completion date of design will be examined once the City obtains access to the property and the design teams finishes all of the necessary soil borings.  Design of the project is currently on-hold.","628096","472526","155568.93","Design",,"Greenways","Green","Project is on budget.","Green","Project is on schedule.","TBD","2023 (Oct.)",,,"AECOM","TBD","T-SPLOST","https://alpharetta.data.socrata.com/api/views/yuke-ij4s/files/e8f39d64-d7e6-4b45-8d30-ef93ae42fff8","citywide"
"C2104","WEBB BRIDGE ROAD (NORTH POINT PARKWAY TO GREENWAY)","Environment","This project will include the design of a new bridge over Big Creek to replace the existing vehicular and pedestrian bridges and of a 10' wide multi-use trail with a 6' wide planting strip along Webb Bridge Road from east of North Point Parkway to the Big Creek Greenway culvert under Webb Bridge Road.  Street trees and pedestrian lighting will be provided along the shoulders.  The design will seek to preserve the existing streetscape along the frontage of East Gate Subdivision.  The new bridge will provide two 10.5' travel lanes, header curb, 2' separation (stamped concrete or concrete pavers) and a 10' multi-use trail.  Bike accommodations will be provided on the roadway from east of North Point Parkway to west of the proposed new bridge over Big Creek.  At that point, bicyclists will be merged onto the multi-use trails.  Refined concept plans and decision matrix were submitted on February 15, 2021.  The design team was given direction to move forward with the ""Alternate 3"" concept based on this information.  Design team is proceeding with Alternate 3 which calls for the new bridge to be constructed parallel to the existing bridge.  This alternate minimizes environmental impacts and property needs from the Alpharetta High School property but does have greater impacts on City-owned property east of Big Creek and ties back to the existing Webb Bridge alignment further to the east.  Preliminary plans were scheduled to be submitted to the City on July 28, 2021.  Due to additional QA/QC items discovered during staffing transitions on this project and the Greenway to Webb Bridge Way project, the design team requested delaying the submittal of preliminary plans to August 13, 2021.  The extra two weeks will be made up during development and finalization of the right of way plans and will not impact the overall schedule.  Right of way plans were submitted on October 4, 2021.  Current Activity includes Design team working on final plans to include 10.5' lanes and 2' curb and gutter where there are no bike lanes.  Submittal of Final Plans are anticipated for April 25, 2022.","692508","310365","382143","Construction",,"Roadways","Green","Project is on budget.","Green","Project is on schedule.","2022 (Feb.)","2024 (Sept.)",,,"Pond & Company","Excellere Construction LLC","T-SPLOST","https://alpharetta.data.socrata.com/api/views/fxhk-sunr/files/59b19427-f885-4f2f-aadb-af8a1afabc7a","citywide"

"C1712","ALPHA LOOP","Community","The Alpha Loop is a dynamic and transformative project for Alpharetta. These multi-use paths connecting Avalon to Downtown Alpharetta will involve two interconnected routes including a three-mile inner loop and a five-mile outer loop that would link locations like Downtown Alpharetta, Avalon, and the Northwinds area located at Haynes Bridge Road and S.R. 400. A portion of the three-mile inner loop will have a natural feel, incorporating a greenway that would run along a stream. The trails will include bicycle service areas and pockets of seating areas where people can gather and rest. The Alpha Loop will better connect our neighborhoods, improve our travel and mobility, spur economic development, and elevate the overall quality of life in the Technology City of the South. *ALPHALOOP GAP-THOMPSON STREET*  Among some of the first phases of Alpha Loop along Thompson Street to be constructed were portions traversing both the Voysey Residential Development and the Midwick Residential Development, and will serve as a connection between the existing 12' trail from Haynes Bridge Road and Thompson Street. This standalone project consists of construction of approximately 650 linear feet of a concrete multi-use trail that will traverse the rear portion of 4 parcels and cross a small stream twice to complete the gap. Construction of the trail in the gap between these two projects was awarded to Vertical Earth by City Council on June 3, 2019 in the amount of $572,928.79.  The estimated project completion date was initially December 2019; however, rain delayed construction progress.  Trail section has been completed.  The contractor has installed handicap ramps and brick pavers for the Haynes Bridge crossing and installed thermoplastic inlaid Alpha Loop and impressed brick pattern.  The contractor has installed lighted bollards and bridge safety railings.  The Rapid Flashing Beacon system is installed.  In pavement lighting and traffic striping has been completed and work on puchlist items has been completed for the trail and crossing sections.  For any additional information on elements of this bond project, please contact Andrew Echols, Assistant Construction Manager, at 678-297-6238 or aechols@alpharetta.ga.us. *PHASE A-OLD MILTON PKWY TO WESTSIDE PKWY* Design of the inner loop portion running from Old Milton Parkway to Westside Parkway has been awarded to Pond & Company (original contract amount of $376,190). Included in their proposal is the design of a tunnel under Westside Parkway (referred to as PHASE B), design of various pedestrian bridges and park spaces, identification of locations for public art, and other enhancements as depicted in the master plan.  Change Order #1 to Pond & Company, was issued on October 17, 2019 for the creation of a standalone plan set (Alpha Loop Phase A Section 1) for construction of approximately 600 linear feet of the Alpha Loop south of Old Milton Parkway, behind the Chelsea Walk subdivision.  Change Order #1 increased the design cost by $12,980.00 to $389,170.00.  On Monday, November 4, 2019, Change Order #2 was approved by City Council, which increased the total design cost by $80,380.00 to $469,550.00.  Change Order #2 realigns approximately 450 linear feet of the trail, providing connection to the Atley subdivision and Haynes Bridge Road.  Final plans were submitted to the City for review in April 2020.  PHASE A SECTION 1 - Alpha Loop Phase A Section 1 was awarded by City Council on Tuesday, January 21, 2020 to Summit Construction and Development, LLC in the amount of $333,507.75.  This portion of the project will construct approximately 623 linear feet of trail from its current end within the Chelsea Walk community south towards Avery at Northwinds.  Notice to proceed was issued on March 23, 2020 to Summit Construction and all of the trail section has been installed.  PHASE B - Construction of a pedestrian tunnel under Westside Pkwy allowing for future extension to the east towards Northwinds Pkwy.  The design team has submitted final design plans and the next step would be to begin acquisition of permanent and temporary easements required for construction once funding has been allocated.  *PHASE C- WESTSIDE PKWY TO NORTHWINDS PARKWAY* Design of the inner loop portion running from Westside Parkway to Northwinds Parkway has been awarded to Alta (original contract amount of $226,525).   Alta starts their design where Pond & Company stops their design coming from under the tunnel at Westside Parkway and ends at Northwinds Parkway in the vicinity of the new Northwinds Summit development.  Change Order #1 to Alta was issued on May 21, 2018 for realigning the trail.  As Alta progressed with design of the original alignment of this portion of Alpha Loop, it became clear that the proposed route was cost prohibitive.  After reviewing alternatives, it was decided to modify the alignment to follow an existing asphalt trail along the south side of a tributary to Big Creek to Northwinds Parkway.  This alignment eliminated the need for a bridge crossing over said tributary and an elevated boardwalk system which would have been necessary to address the significant grade change along the original alignment.  Change Order #1 increased the design cost by $22,512.00 to $249,037.00.
