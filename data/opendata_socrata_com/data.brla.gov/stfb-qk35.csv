"2018 Social Vulnerability Index","Government","The 2018 Social Vulnerability Index indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract. Census tracts are subdivisions of counties in which the Census Bureau aggregates statistical data. The SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, every tract receives a ranking for each Census variable, each of the four themes, and an overall ranking.","Health, Social, Vulnerability, Tract","Open Data BR","https://data.brla.gov/Government/2018-Social-Vulnerability-Index/q7v5-ijjg","2021-07-07T00:00:00.000"

"Animal Control Incidents","Public Safety","Incidents responded to by the Baton Rouge Animal Control and Rescue Center (ACRC). ACRC is responsible for carrying out duties related to animal-related situations, including: administering the anti-rabies vaccination, licensing, and tag program; investigating animal cruelty incidents; investigating dog fighting; resolving dangerous animal situations; rescuing injured animals; investigating abandoned animal cases; investigating occult, animal sacrifice, and bestiality cases; resolving stray animal situations; enforcing the leash law and owned animal problems; assisting law enforcement with narcotics, evictions, and DWI cases; enforcing barking dog cases; inspecting dog yards/pens; chaining or tethering compliance; assisting animal welfare groups with feral interventions; and conducting educational programs. As many of the incidents included within this data set involve active cases that are currently under investigation and computerized system limitations do not allow for automated screening of open/closed cases, the identity of animal owners is redacted to protect the privacy of the animal owner. Members of the public interested in the identity of a specific incident may contact ACRC directly to inquire about the incident and, if it is closed, ACRC will release a copy of the file to the person requesting it. However, location data regarding where the incident was reported or occurred is included within this data set, which may or may not be the same location as the animal owner's home or property. In addition, to protect the identity of the complainant (person filing the complaint or alerting ACRC to a potential incident), only the complainant's street name is included as part of this data set. Finally, while all incidents are updated on a daily basis, incidents involving animal cruelty are updated based on a rolling 30-day delay to allow for ACRC to investigate the incident and make a determination as to the validity of the cruelty complaint.","Animal Control, Rescue, Wildlife, Cats, Dogs","Open Data BR","https://data.brla.gov/Public-Safety/Animal-Control-Incidents/qmns-hw3s","2015-06-28T00:00:00.000"

"Legacy Purchase Orders","Government","***Please note, the City-Parish has implemented a new financial and procurement system. Effective 9/14/2017 all purchase order processing was halted in the legacy system. This dataset was comprised of data from this legacy system. Our new system went online on 10/2/2017. We are working towards providing the purchase orders from the new system and hope to have it available by the end of October. Listing of all purchase orders issued to procure goods and/or services within City-Parish. In the City-Parish Purchasing system, a purchase order (PO) is made up of two components: a header and one or many detail items that comprise the overarching PO. The header contains information that pertains to the entire PO. This includes, but is not limited to, the total amount of the PO, the department requesting the purchase and the vendor providing the goods or services. The detail item(s) contain information that is specific to the individual item ordered or service procured through the Purchase Order. The item/service description, item/service quantity and the cost of the item is located within the Purchase Order details. There may be one or many detail items on an individual Purchase Order. For example, a Purchase Order for a computer equipment may include three items: the computer, the monitor and the base software package. Both header information and detail item information are included in this dataset in order to provide a comprehensive view of the purchase order data. The Record Type field indicates whether the record is a header record (H) or detail item record (D). In the computer purchase example from above, the system would display 4 records – one header record and 3 detail item records. It should be noted header information will be duplicated on all detail items. No detail item information will be displayed on the header record.","Purchasing, Procurement, Purchase Orders","Open Data BR","https://data.brla.gov/Government/Legacy-Purchase-Orders/54bn-2sqf","2015-03-07T00:00:00.000"
