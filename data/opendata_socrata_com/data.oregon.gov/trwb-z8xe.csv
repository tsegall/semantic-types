Callie,Meiners,photocallie@gmail.com,,OR,"Please, do not support the Air Quality 2016 Temporary Rules. These onerous rules put an unnecessary and unsustainable burden on local manufacturers. The rules do not address the real air quality problems facing Portland. Instead they target small businesses that do not produce large tax revenues. Bullseye and Uroboros are known around the world as businesses that make quality glass, ethically and locally. These rules are focused only on these small local business and not large producers of chemicals which there is such sudden concern over, such as any number of other glass manufacturers (consider alcohol bottling?).  Lest we forget the incredibly high levels of car and truck exhaust inhaled daily, but this is not a concern for the DEQ-but art glass-that's where we draw the line now?




These onerous new rules come less than a week after the DEQ found NO evidence that heavy metal emissions were causing harm. The DEQ found NO evidence of harmful levels of arsenic, chromium or cadmium in schools. It appears these rules are being introduced merely to calm public opinion. These companies have made beautiful glass in Portland for forty years. I'm afraid that if these rules will drive them out of business. Certainly their employees locally will be harmed and the ripple of these changes will be felt by the art glass community around the world.




I don't understand. I thought Oregon supported the arts. I thought Portland supported local businesses and workers. I have never been more disappointed to call Portland home.",

To whom it may concern,

I welcome DEQ's actions to reduce harmful emissions of certain heavy metals from some art glass facilities -- but I disagree with the notion that closing this regulatory loophole is sufficient. DEQ seems to believe that investigations of impairments to our air, water and soil aren't really worth bothering about; and that since the public is alarmed at this one particular instance -- art glass manufacturers in Portland -- a very specific patch on existing regulations is all that's needed. This would completely miss the point.

The public needs a more vigorous DEQ and a Department director more zealous for the health of the public and of our natural resources. We need an agency that actively seeks out impairments that compromise our environment and human health, and then acts with resolve to alleviate them.

As an Oregonian living near a railroad company's creosote-emitting tie plant, I see, smell and feel (have headaches) the impacts of impaired air quality on a regular basis. DEQ has done nothing substantial to support my community's health or environmental integrity. So it comes unfortunately as no surprise that the agency was so lax in seeking out heavy metal contamination in Portland neighborhoods. The human beings in my community, as in the Portland neighborhoods near the glass manufacturers, just don't seem to matter to DEQ. It should not take front-page news articles to motivate DEQ employees and leaders to do their jobs!

I strongly urge DEQ officials to reform their agency into one that stands up to polluters, and stands up for the health of Oregonians first and foremost. I ask DEQ not to begin regulating a few heavy metals from a specialized manufacturing sector in Portland, but rather to strengthen all harmful heavy metals emitted by all industries -- indeed, by any sources -- in all Oregon cities and towns.

Respectfully, Dan Richardson

Marc,Rose,marcrose.b@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I understand the need/desire to protect local businesses, but not particularly when local businesses refuse to even acknowledge that their business practices have been a problem in the past. To date, Bullseye has been arrogant and shown no contrition. The company refuses to even accept that the emissions measured are coming from their factory, despite the evidence.  I would contrast Bullseye to Urorburos, which reached an agreement with DEQ to limit emissions voluntarily. I sincerely hope that we do not now see a watered down version of rules that have been bent to Bullseye's wants.  Please do not put business interests over public health and safety.

Regina,Loos,503regina@gmail.com,,Oregon,"It is absolutely critical that toxic elements not be released into our air, water or land. I support your temporary rules but would like to see them broad enough to include protection from the next potential polluter.

My family has lived about 10 blocks from Bullseye Glass for the past 28 years. Well over a year ago my doctor found some metals in my system. Mercury was finally gone but the cadmium persisted. ""What do I need to change? Where is it coming from?"" I asked my doctor. ""The environment. Food. It's hard to tell,"" he answered.

Next to hit our family was the threat of prostate cancer and cadmium is a very high common denominator.

And I will always be wondering about my good friend and neighbor (who lived here for 30 years) and recently died of kidney cancer.  He was in his 50's.

Bullseye and other glass manufacturers are working towards installing filters, which will further reduce risk. These temporary rules are overly burdensome and not needed.",
Paul,Ruscher,ruscherp@lanecc.edu,Lane Community College,Oregon,"I am writing as an atmospheric scientist who has taught graduate level atmospheric chemistry before.  I am writing in support of the need for new requirements for monitoring and modeling with respect to the possibility of heavy metal air contamination near manufacturing facilities that are involved in production of colored art glass.  Such contaminants are demonstrated health hazards and even though EPA has not yet necessarily established federal guidelines for minimum acceptable risk for all of these contaminants, it does not mean that they are not harmful.  Public health studies on the risk of hexavalent chromium and cadmium in particular, are numerous, and DEQ's proposed rule is a good start to address them.  There are over 6,000 studies on cadmium and other heavy metals in the literature just since 2012, and over 800 on hexavalent chromium.  

My primary concerns with the proposed rule is the lack of specificity as to the monitoring and modeling requirements imposed on the manufacturers and the lack of specification as to filtration.  There is a great burden on DEQ to use best practices here with respect to each of these items, and there is also uncertainty as to what will be acceptable.  For example, atmospheric stability and wind direction and speed will all have a bearing on the resultant plume for any escaping contaminant from any source.  Under stagnant flow conditions, so common in the Pacific northwest, concentrations can be quite localized to the facility and quite intense.  Dilution will naturally occur when ventilating winds and mixing occurs under less stable conditions, perhaps reducing the risk near the facility, but broadening the plume.   The proposed rule could be strengthened if some details as to appropriate modeling and monitoring procedures are specified.  Both mobile and fixed sampling should be contemplated for known large sources.  

In addition, I am concerned about the apparent restriction that the rule defines with respect to two facilities in Portland.  Are there other facilities in the state which should also be required to follow the rule?  What if new facilities are started in other areas?  The rule should be clarified to indicate that any facility that uses these materials, and perhaps not just in the quantities mentioned, should be subject to the rule.  

Finally, there may be motivation here by people in the Portland metropolitan area to create a regional or county air pollution authority.  This makes some sense in the context of an airshed, which does not respect county boundaries.  If there were a true regional approach here, it would have to involve multiple counties in the Portland area, including those north of the Columbia River.

The lack of monetary penalties is a non-deterrent to industry emitters.  The proposed rules lack even rudimentary mandatory public notification standards if a violation should occur.  The proposed rules lack specific mandated and continuous science-based air quality monitoring requirements that are as stringent as or more stringent than the standards used by the EPA.  The proposed rules should require any emission control devices to be properly maintained and inspected, and all records produced as a result of these inspections to be made public records.

Shawn,Ingersoll,Shawnwingersoll@gmail.com,,Oregon,"It is my sincere opinion that the metals listed on this temporary rule are lacking. It is highly important that all toxic metals (or materials that we do not yet know their impact, include the precautionary principle here) used at these facilities be known to EQC and DEQ and that they are added to this list. In addition, any new metals in the future that have not been used in the past or currently should also be reviewed for inclusion when and if that time comes. They may be able to install a bag on one furnace, make the glass with the limited defined metals at this furnace, and still use other unfiltered furnaces on other toxic metals that were never included. Allowing for continued human and environmental damage despite this ruling.

Questions related to this concern:
What if they increase production of other metals like Lead?",
Concerned,Parent,voiceofathena@yahoo.com,,Oregon,"I support Clean Air AND Bullseye & Uroboros â€” Glass Makers are NOT the Enemy

I am a SE Portland native, an artist, and a mother. I care deeply about these issues, and support a rational fact based approach to reducing air toxics that does NOT target and destroy the art glass world. 

I advocate for the State, Regulators, and City of Portland to stop feeding the â€œglass crisisâ€&#65533; media blitz, and work cooperatively with ALL industrial source points equally and rationally in a way that improves air quality AND protects the lively hood of employees and artists.

Hasty regulations, made in reaction to fear and misinformation, which are dominating public discourse, do not protect public health. 

The EPA has standards. Part of the current misinformation is that nothing is known about glass manufacturing emissions. When in truth quantitative standards have already been created. Part of the controversy lies in that â€œperiodic or pot furnaces are not part of the source category. The final rule applies only to glass manufacturing plants that operate continuous furnaces and use one or more of the glass manufacturing metal HAP as raw materials.â€&#65533; and therefore these standards have never been applied to the artisan glassmakers in Portland. 

But the formulas and acceptable levels already exist. pg 5 â€“ â€œThe Glass Manufacturing area source category was listed for regulation under section 112(c)(3) for its contribution of the following urban HAP: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel. The glass manufacturing final rule requires each new or existing affected furnace to comply with a PM emission limit of 0.1 gram per kilogram (g/kg) (0.2 pound per ton (lb/ton)) of glass produced or an equivalent metal HAP emission limit of 0.01 g/kg (0.02 lb/ton) of glass produced.â€&#65533; 

What would make more sense, and seem reasonable for all sides, is that with the lack of DEQ standards, they not scramble to reinvent the wheel, and fall back on using EPA standards to calculate the allowable usage of these metals, allow Bullseye Glass and Uroboros to resume operations within this usage while continuing to report raw materials consumption and monitor ambient air. In addition, DEQ should continue to work with these glass companies, which have been more than willing to cooperate, to make improvements that would reduce overall emissions in a fact based and scientific way, allowing them to remain financially viable employers while investing in filtration and control technology that will improve the industry as a whole and ensure public health. These standards are available here: https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/area/fr26de07.pdf

As I have followed the unfolding of this story, and watched neighbors griped with fear turn away from civil discourse and solutions, instead embracing misinformation and anger to attack and suppress any dissent to their narrative, going so far as to personally attack, slander and threaten â€“ I have been afraid to speak out in dissent, and that is a terrifying thing in a democracy. The loudest voice is not always the most accurate, it takes all of us to make this city what it is â€” we need to stop letting fear divide us and focus on facts and whole truths.

Henry,Grimmett,Ghanalytical@gmail.com,GH Analytical Labs,OR,"After a review of the literature and the epa study I find the response by both the public and the legislature to be hysterical. Certainly we want to protect the publics health and keep cadimum and other heavy metals out of the environment but theses rules probably do neither. First, the glass companies have general been good neighbors providing jobs, spending money with other local companies and supporting various non profits. They have all keep emissions within legal limits. If you elect to change those limits it should be across all industries not just 5 or 6 glassmakers, some of whom are very small. Second, the rules need to have a phase in which has been the historical norm, not a do it now or close. Finally, there needs to be a rational for demanding these extraordinary expenses, it can't be because some neighbors are on a crusade. One glass plant, located only in an arsenic hot spot actually uses no arsenic but is located next fodoor to a Styrofoam melting facility and across the street from an asphalt recycling plant, the most probable source. To close them down or require them to invest $500,000 won't make an iota of difference for the health of the neighborhood but would eliminate 20 good jobs. Now's not a good time to use a hammer even if it would get a few members of the public of your back.",
Robin,Denburg,robin@realtyrobin.com,self,Oregon,"I would like to request the following changes to the proposed rules:

o lower the amount of emissions triggering the required baghouse from 10 tons (a massive amount!) to 1 ton.

Reason- if I live next door to an entity emitting 9.9 tons of a heavy metal I'm going to trigger the same emergency situation.  10 tons was arbitrarily chosen and is much too high.

o include all heavy metals, not the limited list as currently drafted by DEQ staff.

Reason- scientific evidence is clear that metals like, for one example, nickel is a significant health risk.  It is not currently included in the rule language.  Additionally the cost to a glass maker is not significant to install either a combo or additional baghouse for additional heavy metals.

o have the rules apply statewide, not just the Portland area

Reason- other cities also have citizens living in proximity to glass makers and other non-glass maker heavy metal emitters.  They are also being exposed to an increase in cancer especially if they are in close proximity to a manufacturer.

o This rule really should address heavy metal emitters that are not just glass facilities.  So my specific request is that it not be limited to glass makers.  Realizing that is unlikely I would request a different emergency rule making session for non-glass maker emitters.

Reason - there is ample evidence in the Forest Service study that non-glass makers are ALSO emitting heavy metals.  They need to be addressed just as urgently as the glass makers.

o Direct DEQ in conjunction with the Forest Service to do another round of moss testing in Portland and a first round in various other Oregon cities.  And to expand the type of heavy metals being tested.

o Have penalties for violators.  The proposed rules have no penalty for violators.  This needs to be a component.  It needs to be strong enough that someone questioning doing this realizes it's better to install a relatively inexpensive baghouse.  

I would suggest a fine of $50,000 per violation.

o Add third party monitoring language, paid for by the emitter.  There is no language addressing testing pre or post installation of a capture system.  This should be part of the permit fees and the work should be independently done, by someone like EPA or Linda George.

o Direct DEQ staff to study in detail California air quality standards.  This should be both for glass makers as well as all heavy metal emissions. 

Reason- there is no need to reinvent the wheel and California has a process and regulations that work and work effectively.  They are recognize by the federal government as largely best in class standards. 

Thank you in advance for your evaluation of my comments.

I would also like to have DEQ staff specifically respond to:

o Why was 10 tons chosen as the limit?  Was it an arbitrary number?  If so why is it just a massively high amount?

o Why are the rules not addressing the entire state?

o How were the type of heavy metals included in the language chosen?  Why, specifically, were other heavy metals like nickel excluded?",

katherine,saunders,katefsaunders@gmail.com,lewis creek glassworks,Oregon,"I am writing concerning the recent Oregon Environmental Quality Commissionâ€™s meeting to discuss Administrative Rules Chapter 340, regarding changing air quality rules in light of recent air quality issues in Portland.  
It is clear that some regulations need to be changed concerning air quality and manufacturers of colored glass in Oregon, but I think that any regulatory decisions must come from sound scientific study and are not hastily made reactions due to public pressure and speculation.
Bullseye has recently concluded, after careful scientific research, that their use of chromium III is safe.  Chromium III does not turn into chromium VI in their factory.  To change the current air quality regulations to prohibit Bullseye from using chromium III is not based on any scientific data and will have a serious, perhaps fatal, impact on the ability of Bullseye to continue in business.
Bullseye has already begun the process of installing better air quality systems and should be applauded for its immediate response to the air quality situation.
Bullseye has been a conscientious and responsible business in Portland for many, many years.  It employs a lot of people.  Bullseye is recognized worldwide for its highest quality fusible glass, which it spent years developing.   As a glass artist, I have already felt the impact of their voluntary suspension of certain glass colors.  It will have a worldwide impact on many, many people.
DEQ has a responsibility to both the citizens of Oregon and to the businesses that lie within the state.  It will be possible to satisfy both groups if the process of making sound legal and science based decisions are followed.  More time and input on the facts needs to happen, and judgement made only after all the scientific data is studied.   
Thank you for your time and consideration on this important issue.

Maeghan,Culver,mculver@nwim.org,Northwest Integrative Medicine,OR,"To Whom It May Concern,
     I appreciate the care the DEQ is taking in finding the cause of the heavy metal exposure to the Portland area citizens and environment.  As a physician with extensive training in environmental medicine and treatment of toxicity, it is imperative that we address sources of possible exposure, such as those found near Bullseye and Uroboros glass manufacturing plants.  However, based on recent OHA findings, the data suggests that the actual short-term risk to citizens is negligible, suggesting that we have time to take corrective action.    
    Furthermore, as is mentioned in the summation on the DEQ website, the DEQ has previously recognized that the level of risk is proportionate to production size.  From previous legislation, it seems that both of these companies were following the permitted processes, yet these companies have been targeted by the media as companies poisoning their neighborhood.  Large glass production companies will need to adjust their production methods to control for heavy metals, but the application of these methods should be proportionate to the risk they pose to the public, just as it has been. 
    I am concerned that by acting drastically in response to the sensationalism of the news, this current emergency measures may jeopardize the well being of local businesses and the job positions they provide in my community.  As a policy is developed, tiered requirements should be proposed, based on the level of risk of exposure (ie quantity of harmful materials use).  It would also be beneficial to allow time to implement changes, especially considering that there is no proposed short-term harm from the current levels of exposures.  
    I greatly appreciate your time and consideration of this and trust that the DEQ will work to find a solution that takes all parties, citizens and small businesses, into consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Maeghan Culver",

Abigail,Spring,abi@abispring.com,Abi Spring,OR,"I am confused by the DEQ's desire to make a temporary ruling regarding the use of Chromium 3 in their glass. From my understanding this kind of ruling is only appropriate when there is an immediate threat to public health. The OHA has not found this to be the case. 

Further, your motives seem extremely political rather than science or public interest based when you look at the fact that in 2013 when Precision Castparts was found to be the number ONE toxic air polluter in the country and nothing was done to them, no temporary ruling was passed, at that time. 

I am an artist. And yes I do work with glass, but Bullseye's survival wouldn't have much of an effect on me since I get the bulk of my glass from other sources.  What does affect me is that our states  DEQ and EQC seem to be operating with little knowledge of what they are making decisions about.

There are a few points I hope will be changed before the rules are approved. Below are my concerns. 

--Please prohibit chromium III as well if the glass-making furnaces are not equipt with emission controls since it produces chromium IV when heated. 

 â€œIf DEQ does not deny or approve the Notice of Intent to Construct within 10 days after receiving the Notice, the Notice will be deemed to be approved.â€&#65533; ---Please hire enough staff at DEQ to review all notices of Intent to Construct. 

â€œEach CAGM must perform the following source testing on at least one controlled glass-making furnace.â€&#65533;
--Please have all glass-making furnaces tested to insure all are operating within guidelines. 


â€œ(1) CAGMs may not use arsenic, cadmium or chromium VI in raw materials in any glass-making furnace that is not controlled by an emission control device DEQ approved.â€&#65533; 
--Please add chromium III since it produces Chromium IV when heated. 

â€œFor the purpose of establishing a maximum allowable chromium III usage rate, the following are required: 
(a) Performing a source test in an uncontrolled furnace or at the inlet of an emission control device as specified below:
(B) Test while making a glass that DEQ agrees is made under the most oxidizing combustion conditions and that contains a high percentage of chromium III as compared to other formulas the CAGM uses;â€&#65533;
--Please alert the public in the surrounding area to the date of this test since the furnace will be uncontrolled at time of test.

--Please have a DEQ staff member preform all tests not company employee.

--Please set fines for non-compliance
--Please make sure all glass-making furnaces are required to have emission control units.

If the levels of metals are not of concern-able  amounts, and a bag house is being installed to prevent the metals getting into the air? It seems very much over kill to keep them from producing much of there line of products, and Possibly putting them out of business. And UN-employing some very fine talent and important research in our industry.

Matt,Vinci,mvinci72@gmail.com,,CA,"To whom it may concern,

It strikes me that Bullseye Glass has been there for 40 years.  Without rancor I say this: If there are dangerous emmissions from the glass manufacturing process, with certainty you must have a mountain of evidence of the harm it has done to the local population.  If you don't have that evidence then isn't the role of your agency to inform the public of that fact, rather than shudder Bullseye?  

After 40 years there would have to be a lot of unambiguous material evidence of environmental harm and a long standing surge in health problems related to the compounds in question.  Again, Isay this without rancor.  I'm not trying to goad anyone there.  However, after 40 years, the evidence wouldn't be subtle. It would be a screaming mountian.     If that is not there, then enacting rules that would put these glass manufacturers out of business is just wrong.  Additionally, not informing the public of the obvious fact that there is no large scale, long standing surge in very dire health problems is irresponsible here.   

My two cents.

Michael,Beaman,mb@beamanarch.com,Beaman Architecture Ltd.,Oregon,"The State of Oregon should be working to find relative common ground in complex issues where public safety is involved and where forthright businesses are concerned.  Please accept these comments in support of Bullseye Glass's position:

1.	This is an improper use of temporary rule making. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.


2.	There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1] OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;[2]

Further, DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;[3]

DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;
 
3.	Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.


4.	With minor changes to correct scientific errors and omissions in the currently proposed rule, Bullseye Glass is willing to sign an agreement that achieves all of DEQâ€™s goals and allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.


5.	The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.


6.	Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public concern resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.


7.	The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.


8.	If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. We support an agreement that is similar to the temporary rules, but unlike the temporary rules, also allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.


9.	Bullseye Glass Co. has a payroll of $7.5 million dollars. 130 Portland families and 20 other Bullseye families depend on Bullseye for jobs. Hundreds of Oregon artists and craftspeople depend upon Bullseye products. Tens of thousands of artists across the United States and the world depend upon Bullseye products.

Therefore, I urge you to do further investigation and work with these companies to find a solution to this problem based on scientific fact, and not react to the emotional responses from the media and public.  Your own technicians state that there is no public health concern based on recent testing.  Therefore, putting a business at risk by implementing rules that are not based on fact, when so many people depend on it for their livelihood, is irresponsible.

Until studies are done that show harmful emissions, it is unfair to target these 2 manufacturers and potentially ruin their businesses and the business of the buyers or their products.  Since the studies have not been done,it would be prudent to initiate studies to see what emissions come from these colored glass manufacturers.  Then, and only then, can decisions be made regarding the manufacturing process and its emissions.  To adopt temporary rules that limit the manufacturing, is premature and harmful to the industry.  This adoption of temporary rules would be like telling jewelry makers that they can't make jewelry because certain metals might be emitted into the atmosphere.  A much better choice would be to run tests to see exactly what emissions come from the process and then let scientists determine if  these emissions cause a problem.

Also why is Bullseye being restricted when they are not the only glass manufacturer?

I stand with Bullseye Glass in its efforts to continue operations as a responsible citizen in the social and business community of Portland, Oregon. I support Bullseye Glass because I am a member of the glass art community and because our family has a son who resides in Portland.  This issue affects the economic health of Bullseye Glass, a Portland business. 

Regulatory decisions must be based on science, not political issues. A leading scientist, Dr. William LaCourse of Alfred University, has said Bullseyeâ€™s furnaces do not produce toxic chromium.

Delores ,Taylor ,Pdvgirl@gmail.com,,WA,I'm disappointed that an entire industry has been placed under attack without scientific support that the glass industry is the cause of pollution without addressing all other industries that are worse polluters.  Science should have been done first then meetings with all industries doing their bit to clean up the air not isolating one industry and turning a blind eye to other industries.  Also unduly making this about public reaction rather than how science can make Portland a better place to live with all businesses not just two businesses being singled out.  The point should be to provide clear and accurate directions that is fair to all.,
Lori,Hudson,lori.hudson@superiorfarms.com,Superior Farms,California,"I feel it is imperative that the decision to limit usage of stated minerals and metal is based on actual scientific data not on speculation. I have read a summary of the results on study done by the OHA taken earlier in the year in Portland. This  study stated that minimal emission were documented and levels of hazardous materials emitted were well under hazardous levels. Adopting temporary rules are not the solution. By doing so you are targeting two small companies unfairly. These controls seem technically flawed and are not likely to improve the air quality of Portland.  From what I know both of these companies are for improvement of air quality, but these temporary rules will not accomplish this goal.
Both the DEQ and EPA have acknowledged there is not clear evidence of acute or chronic health risks based on the usage of Cr(III).  There is no proof that CR(III)  will change into a more toxic for of chromium - Cr(VI).  Scientific evidence clearly indicates that furnaces heat won't turn Cr(III) into Cr(VI). Do not adopt policies that are not ground in good science.",

Philippa,Rubell,psrubell@gmail.com,glass artist,California,"I live in California, as you can see, but have visited Portland on several occasions to take classes offered by Bullseye, and have also visited the Uroborus factory. The glass center, including its factory has always struck  me by its meticulous concern about health and safety, with all facilities being carefully vented, waste appropriately disposed of, and a concern for environmental issues in general. While, of course, dangerous by-products should not be allowed to be emitted, Bullseye seems to be anxious to commit to creating whatever new filtering systems are requested, and to comply with all scientifically documented information on the subject. 
The issue regarding chromium seems to be scientifically invalid, as the chemistry of the glass manufacture depends on the chromium remaining in its non-toxic form, and there is nothing in the process to engender the formation of the dangerous chromium isotope, in fact processes are in place to prevent its formation. Punishing the the company on the basis of a gut reaction, rather than scientific evidence is unfair, especially in the light of the pollution we are all subjected to on a daily basis by larger enterprises, and a  restriction on the use of chromium, which could quite likely close down Bullseye, and the glass art world in general would be tragic. Portland is truly the glass art center of the world now, and this is something to be very proud of. The loss of jobs, a thriving and benevolent company, and an art form would impact the population of Portland, and people like myself who love the products, and need them to continue with our art.
In conclusion, I think it is obviously of benefit to everyone to provide the best filtering processes available, but the banning of the use of chromium, which would make the manufacture of much of the glass palette impossible, is an unproven knee-jerk response. One might as well say let's ban eggs because they contain sulfur. I entreat you to not pass hasty judgement on a company which, while small in the general scheme of things, is huge in the world of art-glass, and irreplaceable.

Mark,Brody,brodyarts@gmail.com,Glass artist and school teacher,OR,"Hello-
My name is Mark Brody, and I am a glass mosaic artist and I have been teaching mosaic arts in schools throughout Portland for the past 14 years. I have worked with well over 5,000 students using Bullseye Glass to create legacy projects that remain in schools for decades, and create lasting memories for these children as they grow older. Many of these projects are made using donated glass from Bullseye Glass Co., and if the temporary rules were hastily put in place in early April, this would have a direct effect on a project I have scheduled with the Chinese Immersion program at Woodstock Elementary. We were planning on creating a rendition of the Tilikum Bridge in the style of traditional Chinese scroll paintings. I plan to work with (80) 5th grade students. Bullseye Glass has a long history of responsible operation, and has been a supporter of community education. 
Below is a version of the TIlikum Bridge I did with the 8th grade students of Beverly Cleary School in 2015. This glass was leftover materials donated by Bullseye from the Tri-Met Orange light-rail station installations.





Bullseye Glass has been my primary supplier of stained glass for my school as well as my professional work. In 2015, the Portland garden publisher Timber Press published my how-to book entitled Mosaic Garden Projects, which has 25 different designs for outdoor locations. This book has been a huge seller in the US, Canada and England, and in it I name Bullseye Glass as my only resource for buying glass.  Finally, I will be teaching a Fountain mosaic class next week at the SAMA Mosaic Arts International conference in San Diego. I will be taking Bullseye Glass with me for these projects. So my appreciation for Bullseye Glass reaches well beyond the grade school students I teach.




I came to the DEQ session on March 15 to learn more about the current situation. What I found most striking was the OHAâ€™s report stating that the soil and air quality tested â€œdid not show harmful impactsâ€&#65533; on the nearby neighborhoods, where I myself live. If there is no immediate health risks, then how can the DEQ take drastic actions which will harm this business, artists and citizens whom benefit from their work?
I strongly urge you to work with Bullseye Glass and come up with a solution that does not curtail their responsible practices. They are currently placing large baghouse filters on their chimneys to control emissions. They are taking the right steps. Please use science to decide policy, and not public fear. 

Thank you,

Dalene,Reese,haciendadelsol@q.com,Hacienda del Sol Stained Glass,N.M.,"There are many issues to consider. Please let DEQ and the Environmental Quality Commission know whether you agree with the points below, and let them know how you would be affected by the temporary or permanent loss of Bullseyeâ€™s products.
1.This is an improper use of temporary rule making. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

 Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

 If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.

2.There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1] OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;[2]

 Further, DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;[3]

 DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;
 
3.Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

4.With minor changes to correct scientific errors and omissions in the currently proposed rule, Bullseye Glass is willing to sign an agreement that achieves all of DEQâ€™s goals and allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

5.The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.

6.Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public concern resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.

7.The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

8.If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. We support an agreement that is similar to the temporary rules, but unlike the temporary rules, also allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

9.Bullseye Glass Co. has a payroll of $7.5 million dollars. 130 Portland families and 20 other Bullseye families depend on Bullseye for jobs. Hundreds of Oregon artists and craftspeople depend upon Bullseye products. Tens of thousands of artists across the United States and the world depend upon Bullseye products.

There is no alternative in all the world to the glass produced by Bullseye.  Without it, I â€“ and thousands like me â€“ will no longer be able to produce my work in the same manner.  I am also an attorney who has handled environmental litigation.  So I understand the difficulty inherent in the situation in Portland.  However, I urge the DEQ to be thoughtful in issuing temporary regulations.  While everyone involved wants to protect human health and the environment, even temporary regulations must be designed to alleviate actual concerns supported by the facts and by science.  Your own studies show there is no immediate health risk.  Further, Bullseye has been completely cooperative and continues to be willing to sign an agreement that achieves all of DEQâ€™s goals.  Therefore, please continue working with Bullseye on final rules that address all environmental concerns, but allow it to remain in full business. ",

For the past 45 years, I have found them to be consistent in their environmental concerns. 
Please do not make a temporary rule targeting this one small industry.  Please consider a rule ONLY when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.  You need to use science and facts BEFORE you issue a rule, not AFTER.
    I am an avid and active environmentalist, concerned with clean air and water.  I am also an active glass sculptor who relies on a full palette of colors from Bullseye. I would be willing to subsume my professional needs to those PROVEN to be detrimental to the environment, but that is not the case here.  If you issue a ruling without the proper science to back it up, I could lose my business for lack of a full palette of glass colors to offer my clients.  I could by glass in my home state of Washington, but it is of vastly inferior quality, and I would hope that the Washington DEQ would also limit these factories' productions due to the presence of CrIII in the air.

Leng,Hunter,jeh32@msn.com,Chan Leng Geok Hunter Inc,Houston,"Bullseye is responsible for the development of Studio Art in USA & probably also round the world. Thus  It is responsible for putting Portland on the International map. As an Architect, sculptor and a glass lover, I try to attend the conferences whenever one was held & I take the chance to visit the city's beloved bookshop, seafood and stash up on the hazelnuts as well. The Owners have also been very supportive of many of the artists that are now considered masters in the art and worked tirelessly to promote young artists (a renown group now from Australia) and develop the possibilities for glass.
I understand that they have also been regularly giving art pieces to the Portland Museum & the Corning Museum. From my years of 'knowing' (meeting at the Conferences) them I recognized the Owners of Bullseye as people who do good work and not ask for praise. 
Air quality is important but I hope DEQ work with Bullseye to come to a viable workable solution, bearing in mind that there are also no conclusive cause  that Bullseye cause the emissions. Cutting off certain production that will ruin their busibess is drastic. 
Do not let a great American institution like Bullseye bite the dust because because it may be causing the noxious emissions. That wll be a sad end for Portland, for the US and the world. Glass is one of the oldest medium dating back to antquity & I hope DEQ appreciates what a great institution Bullseye is and work with it.

Linda,Norris,linda@linda-norris.com,artist,UK,"As an UK based artist and fervent environmentalist I have been following the recent toxic air emissions revelations closely. I understand that Bullseye has always been 100% compliant with State emissions regulations and has voluntarily temporarily halted use of Chromium, Cadmium and Arsenic in their production following the recent toxic air emissions revelations and is currently installing a 'bagging' system which will be 99% efficient in terms of preventing toxic air emissions from its furnaces in the future. As a responsible company have also employed an environmental consultancy to overhaul all their processes and advise them on the most effective way to proceed to protect their neighborhood and employees.

Bullseye Glass is fundamental to my practice as an artist working with hard-to-reach children and vulnerable adults in my own community. The fabulous range of fully compatible colours has enabled me to draw in people who are marginalised and have limited communication skills, as well as allowing me as an artist in my own right to develop my own artistic expression. There is no replacement for this material as no other company has invested so much expertise, time and experience into developing a truly remarkable palette of colours. The impact of Bullseye Glass on the development of studio glass globally can not be underestimated, and the support and encouragement given to artists and communities by the company through their competitions, prizes and sponsorship represents a massive contribution to glass art on a worldwide scale. Examples of work made with Bullseye Glass are in internationally important collections across the world, such as the V&A Museum, London.

Nothing should take precedence over environmental health, but decisions concerning the use of Chromium and other heavy metals in the factory should be based on proven science, and it concerns me that calls for a temporary ban on the use of these materials are being based on sensationalised press reports and emotive reaction, rather than the bare science. I understand that the proposed restrictions could put the future of the company at risk and could cost the jobs of many employees in Portland and elsewhere across the USA, it would necessarily have a knock on effect on suppliers and artists globally.

Given the fact that latest soil tests show no increased prescence of toxins in the vicinity, and the attempts that Bullseye are making to ensure their toxin emissions falls far below the required minimum level, I would ask that the company be allowed to resume production and safeguard the jobs of their employees, while the state undertake scientific monitoring of emissions and avail themselves of the expertise required to protect the citizens of Oregon from all industrial environmental impact, not just that from two small factories with over 40 years manufacturing experience who contribute so much to glass art and opportunites for marginalised people in communities across the globe.",https://data.oregon.gov/views/trwb-z8xe/files/4961cda5-ef2d-4d4f-b743-6bbf4d38e34d?filename=image001.jpg

Debra,Joseph,djoseph@sssnet.com,Concerned Citizen and Customer of the businesses you are trying to destroy,Ohio,"This is an improper use of temporary rule making. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.

There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1] OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;[2]

Further, DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;[3]

DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;

Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

With minor changes to correct scientific errors and omissions in the currently proposed rule, Bullseye Glass is willing to sign an agreement that achieves all of DEQâ€™s goals and allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.

Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public concern resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.

The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. We support an agreement that is similar to the temporary rules, but unlike the temporary rules, also allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

Bullseye Glass Co. has a payroll of $7.5 million dollars. 130 Portland families and 20 other Bullseye families depend on Bullseye for jobs.

Sheryl,Maloney,sherylmaloney@gmail.com,Resident,OR,"Dear EQC Commissioners,

Thank you for allowing public comment both at the last ECQ meeting as well as during this public comment period. As you know this has been a painful process for both residents and the glass manufacturers. Although I truly sympathize with the concern the manufacturers and the global glass artists have about losing jobs and potentially an art form, I am unable to put the priority of their needs above the health of my family and neighbors.

The Oregon DEQ is supposed to be the steward of the environment, and our first line of defense against these types of toxic situations. Sadly, the Oregon DEQ has been failing to protect our environment and thus the people living and working in it.
I wonâ€™t rehash all the issues and failures of how the last few months have played out, or focus here on the minutia of the temporary rules, as these items have been outlined in detail in the official EPAC statement and the statements of many others who are in favor of regulation. However, I will urge each of you to remember the original mission statement of the Oregon DEQ as you read through hundreds of comments submitted from those who do not live in our great state.

DEQ's mission is to be a leader in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon's air, land and water.

DEQ works collaboratively with Oregonians for a healthy, sustainable environment.

Please remember that this issue is first and foremost about Oregon and Oregonians and take great care not to be swayed by those who do not live here, have to breath our air, are vehemently against any regulation and who are so quick to dismiss our very real concerns for our families and homes as hysteria.

Despite emotion and concern for my family, I feel that proper data, science and extreme due diligence should now be followed before permanent decisions are made about who, how or what to regulate. The devil is in the accuracy of the details and thus far, as is the case with the improper regulation and handling of metals in glass manufacturing, the DEQ and OHA have yet to demonstrate proper care and respect for the environmental data they are charged with on behalf of the publicâ€™s health and safety.

So, I ask you to carefully review and scrutinize every detail of the temporary rule so that you may find the best possible outcome that protects the environment, the health of the people and paves the way for sustainable industry practices. This is a watershed moment that has the potential to be a catalyst for truly cleaning up the air for Oregon and setting the tone for responsible regulations moving forward.

In that spirit, I also urge you to consider other industries in all of Oregon that may be using heavy metals and toxics in your rule-making process. There are so many sources that contribute to our dirty air and simply putting a cap on Bullseyes operation is not a long-term or comprehensive solution that our community will stand by.

Our children are the best natural resource to be ""Made in Oregon"", they are invaluable and their health and safety cannot be equated to glass colors or any other industrialized product. Many Portland children, including my own, attend schools that are ranked in the bottom two percent in the nation for air quality. The time is now to protect our resources and to improve our air rankings as a community, city and state before our childrenâ€™s quality of health suffers beyond repair.

Thank You,

Diane,Routt,droutt@tds.net,,Wa,"As a glass hobbyist I have been following the events in the news regarding two of Portlandâ€™s glass companies, Bullseye and Uroboros, with great interest.   

I have just learned about DEQâ€™s attempt to impose a temporary regulation that is based on judgement not scientific evidence.    Two other agencies, Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Multnomah County Heath Department have stated there is no immediate health risk to the Portland Community.   

Portland is known worldwide as â€˜Glass Cityâ€™.   Many artisans have relocated to the south west region of Oregon and Washington to be closer to their sources.   Many artisans have come to Portland to be able to learn how to work with glass at the Bullseye Resource Center.   I might add Glass conventions have been held in Portland since it is known as the glass hub of the United States.

I have taken classes from Bullseye for the past 10 years from fusing to lampworking.  They have always stressed safety in working with glass and components that we add to the glass for a final product.   Bullseye offers compatibility options with their glass products that no other glass supply markets. 

I recently took a 3-day class with Bullseye and we were taken on a tour through the factory.    I was so impressed with the process and what it takes to make glass.   I know they have taken every precaution to abide by the regulations that have been required since they went into production, this is discussed in the classes they offer.  
I am just a hobbyist but I know many people make their living making products from glass.    The decision not only impacts Bullseye and Uroboros but this temporary rule will impact more than the areas around the factories but peopleâ€™s source of income.

Has DEQ bothered to communicate with OHA and Multnomah County Health Department about their findings?  Has DEQ attempted to understand what is involved in making glass and the years of research Bullseye and Uroboros has invested?   Has DEQ bothered to look at the big picture of their decision, it goes beyond Portland?  

DEQ needs to understand before they start making rushed decisions.   

Glass making has been an art for centuriesâ€¦.

David ,Aavang,quinch9000@gmail.com,,,"I would like to voice my support for Bullseye Glass in Oregon. they supply glass to many small business, in addition to being a small business themselves. 
I have read the scientific analysis of their production of green glass by Dr. LaCourse and the reports by local health authorities that find bullseye glass is not creating a hazardous byproduct during the production of green glass.
I would hope that the DEQ and EPA would not put into effect knee-jerk temporary regulations that have a permanent, damaging result to small business and the people they employ.",
Jean,Fernandes,,"University of Texas Arlington, Sinaca Studios, Creative Arts Center of Dallas",TX,"Please understand that these are small businesses that your regulations will be affecting. These businesses provide thousands of jobs, support a very large community that makes their living from these materials, and are an asset to the local, national, and international economy. If these small businesses shut down as a result of these ""temporary"" regulations, it would collapse an entire community of people.
If there is specific scientific evidence that shows a large contamination/pollution problem as a direct result of the companiesâ€™ manufacturing of art glass, I would completely understand these regulations being implemented, but this does not seem to be the case. If these regulations are imposed on these companies, there will be protests and significant uproar as a result of the unfair discrimination against these two small glass companies. As of now, there is scientific proof online that shows that the furnaces do not turn Cr(III) into Cr(VI), which is the primary concern of the DEQ. Both, DEQ and EPA have acknowledged there is no clear evidence of acute or chronic health risks based on Bullseyeâ€™s use of Cr(III). Bullseye Glass has started to take steps to use baghouses to cut any possible emissions and I think that this is important because it shows the companyâ€™s concern about the environment as well as their willingness to comply with the publicâ€™s concerns.
As of now, the risk of implementing these regulations on Cr(III) on top of the current suspension of cadmium glass production would cut the glass product line by 50%. This would be detrimental for the growth of these companies, the jobs they provide and the glass community that they support. The DEQ needs to take into consideration that scientific evidence currently does not support the regulations that they are planning to implement.",

Your temporary regulations will financially devastate not only these businesses, but the businesses of 1000's of glass artists across the United States.  In addition, Spectrum Glass in Washington state will be harmed because much of their warm colors are made by Uroboros. The science in these temporary rules makes claims of emissions that if are precluded by the nature of the glass. Bullseye has made every effort to be transparent and cooperative. They have posted their intent to make improvements. Your DEQ site has listed a study showing minimal heavy metal residue in the area and this is after the presence of glass manufacturing in those areas for many years. These temporary rules will not produce instant change and harms many more people.  The DEQ should wait, determine exactly what heavy metal emissions actually are and make permanent rules based on science and deliberation and consideration of all involved, not act out of unproved fears. These glass factories are a part of your economy and have paid taxes for their representation. Please honor them with the consideration any citizen of Oregon should expect. Thank You.

Jean,Scholtz,jean.scholtz@mindspring.com,,Oregon,I urge DEQ to not impose temporary restrictions on the rules limiting metals emissions from the processes of art glass manufactures.  The science shows that their current processes are adequate or being addressed at this time.   DEQ should focus on finding a policy that is scientifically supported to put into place permanently.   A temporary order will actually not be temporary and will most likely eliminate two companies and many jobs in the Portland area.  ,
Jim,Piercey,jpstudios@aol.com,"J. PIERCEY STUDIOS, INC",FL,"     Environmental regulation based on accepted scientific guidelines is an imperative - unwarranted regulation based on emotion,
voodoo science, or hysteria,  is not.
     There has to be a logical separation between fact and fiction. If it can be proven that either of these two companies are responsible
for the release of any heavy metals into the environment, then they should forced to comply to the new regs.
     I'm from Florida. Recently I visited the beautiful state of Oregon - a standard bearer for the environment. If there was any other state
I would want to live it, it would be Oregon, not only for its beauty but because the people there seem to really care about the place.
     If in fact, there are increased levels of heavy metals in the soils around Uroboros and/or Bullseye, who is to say that they are the 
responsible parties? Many industries near these glass factories probably use heavy metals (tanneries, paint manufacturers, electro-
plating plants, some types of ceramic manufacturers, cement manufacturers, wood preservation plants). Both of these glass 
manufacturers appear to be located in areas that have historically been industrial. If contamination is found in these areas, who can 
say how long it has been there or from where it originated?
     Just the term ""heavy metals"" cause consternation among people. As for Cr III, it is a naturally occurring form of chromium. It is is many
foods and is a necessary micronutrient - it is necessary for some protein structures and certain enzymatic actions. I would venture that
many of the people that are supporting the the DEQ proposal are the same ones that buy from the health food store, then swallow
chromium picolinate (Cr III)
     Cr VI us altogether a different matter. If it can be proven (using SCIENCE) that either companies furnaces are converting III to VI, 
and it is being released into the air, then it is a problem that should be addressed. 
     These companies make beautiful glass. I use it in my business. If these Oregon factories (as well as the few other glass factories
still located in the USA ) are forced out of business because of arbitrary and unnecessary regulation, then I will in turn have to buy
my materials from overseas sources. It would seem to me (remember, I'm a Floridian) that EPA and DEQ would work together with these 
companies to determine the actual source of these pollutants, then work towards eliminating the source.
    This past year, the Stained Glass Association of America held their annual conference in Portland. We did so because it is the home
of both Uroboros and Bullseye  which are famous around the world. I feel totally confident that both companies
operate with a very high degree of integrity and ethics and are totally dedicated to the environmental wellness of the area.

Susan ,Green,segpdx@yahoo.com,Bullseye Glass,OR,"Greetings- I am writing to you as an almost 21 year employee of Bullseye Glass. Of course, I and everyone at Bullseye is concerned about the environment. We have always been progressive in the way we deal with environmental concerns- meeting and/or exceeding goals and limits that were given to us. 

The issue here  is that we were not informed of these new benchmarks before the information was leaked to the press. And, benchmarks are just that- goals to work TOWARDS.  We are happy to do, and have already begun work on new systems.

My immediate concern is that the proposed temporary rule regarding chromium SEVERELY limits our production. Chromium as we use it is not a hazard, and there is no proof that it can or will be one. There is only proof that it is NOT a health concern. The proposed rules are supposed to be for emergency situations. This is not an emergency. Soil levels tested fine. Air quality is improving and will continue to do so now that we have knowledge and are installing filtration systems. The rule will not make anything better, and will only serve to harm small business. Also, no other small business that uses chrome is in the cross hairs. If this is such a danger, why aren't other businesses that use chrome being targeted in this rule as well?  It's simply not well thought out, or executed, and will only harm the community in that many people may be put out of work. 

Please CAREFULLY consider this rule- it's bad science, will solve nothing, and will possibly harm hundreds of local families, not to mention tens of thousands of people around the world that rely on Bullseye's products for their livelihoods.

I understand the anxiety of Portlandâ€™s residents who live in the vicinity of Bullseye and Urborous Glass manufacturing facilities.

A leading glass scientist from Alfred University, Williams LaCourse, PhD states to obtain the desired colors for Bullseye and Urborous glass, it is not possible for their furnaces to produce toxic chromium.

Barbara,Bader,barboglass@yahoo.com,n/a,Oregon,"My husband, pets, and most of my friends live in southeast Portland. It's clear that DEQ's proposed temporary rules were issued in haste and without due diligence that requires some basic research. This lack of fact-based information was on display to the dozens & dozens of citizens who attended the DEQ hearing on the temp. rules. 

Several of the supposedly knowledgeable people who helped create the document, which they planned to vote on that day and implement the following day, responded to commissioners' questions with a version of, ""I don't know."" If you don't know important information, you find out the answers BEFORE you slam regulations on small businesses that may or may not be the source of the pollution. Don't really know whether the furnace conditions at Uroboros and Bullseye convert harmless C-III to C-VI? Find out! Basic science is out there. 

Meanwhile Uroboros and Bullseye, the two small glass manufacturers singled out for the temp. regulations, immediately and voluntarily ceased production that used the heavy metals in question. In other words, they totally want to make sure their factories are safe from dangerous pollutants. Both have ceased production of about half of all their glass products until everyone agrees that they're safe. Both are spending tons of cash in areas such as environmental consultants, engineers, and having their baghouses built & installed. Employees have been laid off and, if the temp. rules are approved, one or both of these companies may go out of business completely. That's what very well may happen ... just because DEQ crumbled under pressure and issued rules that punish two small businesses when many of the people of Portland decide that some of the so-called newspaper journalists write truly wild stories that call out facts --- when they are not science-based facts; write about the 2 companies, especially Bullseye's, actions -- some of which never happened, and others without correct (or any) context. These journalists and their editors (if there are any editors left on their staffs) do no service to the citizens of Portland, by whipping up an understandable frenzy of fear with such lousy and reporting. Even their choice of words reveal animosity toward  Bullseye, in particular. They should be fired. But that's how newspapers operate nowadays.

Bullseye is already installing a pilot baghouse. Uroboros also is in the baghouse process. 

If the companies can prove, and they can do so, that C-III will not convert to C-VI in their furnaces, there is absolute no danger or reason to force them to stop manufacturing those glass colors for 6 months. 

DEQ's temp. rules are flawed, yet DEQ is eager implement them anyway. 

Portland's pollution problems are far greater than these 2 small companies. PLEASE take your time, do your due diligence, research, and apply appropriate rules across the board to businesses large & small that emit toxics. Why aren't those companies shut down while rules etc. are investigated? Politics, power, money. Most obvious example is, of course, Precision Cast Parts.  ",

The proposed rules under consideration are not properly crafted to solve the overall problem of toxic chemical pollutants in the Portland area, but instead appear to place unjustified limitations on two small, locally-owned businesses while ignoring other industries with greater emissions. 
Uroboros and Bullseye were both founded in Portland over 40 years ago and have been part of our community through thick and thin. They sell their products world-wide and bring that revenue back to Portland in the form of jobs, taxes, education, and support of the arts. Flint, Michigan has lead in their water because they lost their manufacturing jobs, had to cut costs, and made bad decisions. Don't gut a Portland industry ""just in case"", especially when they have been long-term good citizens and are eager to work together with the rest of the community to research and resolve this issue.",
Jennifer,Cheng,jenccheng39@yahoo.com,N/A,CA,"Bullseye Glass has a long history of responsible operation. I stand with Bullseye Glass in its efforts to continue operations as a responsible citizen of the social and business community of Portland, Oregon. 

Regulatory decisions must be based on science, not political issues. A leading scientist, Dr. William LaCourse of Alfred University, has said Bullseyeâ€™s furnaces do not produce toxic chromium. We urge DEQ to rely on science and fact, and not to rush to impose these poorly written and misdirected rules.

1.This is an improper use of temporary rule making. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.

2.There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1] OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;[2]

Further, DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;[3]

DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;

3.Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

4.The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.

5.Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public concern resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.

6.The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. Bullseye Glass Co. has a payroll of $7.5 million dollars. 130 Portland families and 20 other Bullseye families depend on Bullseye for jobs. 

Hundreds of Oregon artists and craftspeople depend upon Bullseye products. Tens of thousands of artists across the United States (including me) and the world depend upon Bullseye products. Please stop the madness - do not adopt these temporary rules.

Elizabeth,Johnston,lisajo.johnston@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I had been a glass artist from about 1996-2014 and used Bullseye and other manufacturer's glass color rods for torch-forming beads and marbles. My studio was located across the street from the Bullseye factory at 2020 SE Bush for the last 1.5 years of that time period. I spent 7-8 hours a day working there on most weekdays. Although I knew there were some metals such as Cadmium used in the color, I was under the impression that the components of the glass I was using were fairly inert within the glass rods. Just to be safe though, I kept the windows open and circulated air from outside with a fan. I transitioned out of the glass business after I heard that some of the lustering colors I had been using were not safe. I thought I was limiting my exposure and assumed that there were air quality standards that the Bullseye factory was adhering too. I was shocked when I found out how high the levels of cadmium and arsenic were in the area, especially since I had already made a career change based on my own, much lower estimates of my exposure.  I feel very strongly that there should be strict limits on toxic factory emissions for any factory size or zone. Many people, including the past and current employees of Bullseye and Uroboros as well as people who have been using their products or lived in the affected areas for years, have already had long-term exposure and will not be able to decrease their own biological accumulations of toxins if the emission of those toxins are allowed to continue.

They require filters and emission testing on cadmium but not nickel. These rules are also only applicable to glass makers. This is a hastily written rule, very much targeting the low hung fruit in an effort to quell public outrage that for all intents and purposes is fighting a bigger fight.

sharon,genasci,sgenasci@spiritone.com,NWDA Air Quality Committee,Oregon,"Draft Written Testimony from NWDA Air Quality Committee to the EQC on Air Toxics Temporary Rulemaking for Small Colored Glass  Manufacturers, 3.22.16

Thank you for the opportunity to send written comments from the NWDA Air Quality Committee, to offer our views of your proposed temporary rules limiting metals emissions from small art glass manufacturers.

First, we would like to remind the EQC that our group, formerly the NWDA Health & Environment Committee, worked closely with ODEQ from 1997 through 2001, when Dr. Robert Amundson, our consultant worked with our NW Portland neighbors to gather VOC data using bucket monitors during strong industrial odor events.  Later he put DEQ beakers on neighborsâ€™ porches to gather dust falling through the air near ESCO Corporation, a multinational foundry on the edge of the neighborhood built in 1913.  The particulates in the dust were analyzed for heavy metals.

These monitoring projects over the years provided evidence of lead, manganese, cadmium, arsenic, chrome Vl at dangerous levels for the public health of nearby residents. 

Four years ago ODEQ was present during negotiations with ESCO for a Good Neighbor Agreement (GNA) that would reduce ESCOâ€™s emissions by 20 per cent, but with no agreement to monitor the three plants to assure the neighbors that new controls were in fact reducing emissions even that amount.

In all those years of working with ODEQ there was no attempt at any rule making to reduce heavy metals in our public airshed.  We welcome ODEQâ€™s belated concern, but the proposed temporary rules only for glass manufacturers is clearly not enough â€“ not nearly enough.  

Now is the time to write rules that apply to all industrial polluters emitting  dangerous, heavy metals statewide.  Please step up and give us the protection we need for our children and ourselves in Oregon.  California and Washington state both have much better air regulations to protect public health.  We are asking ODEQ to lead the way now to a higher standard for controls of heavy metals than Washington & California.

Since 1977, my studio has relied on the high quality and full palette of glass produced at Bullseye Glass Company and Uroboros Glass.  I hope youâ€™ll bear with me â€“ Iâ€™ll try to avoid re-hashing details of which you are much more conversant than I.

Whenever there is an obvious environmental threat to a community, I am sure we all are in full support of aggressive actions to alleviate the threat. However, recent studies by the Oregon Health Authority and the Multnomah County Health Department with oversight by the OEQC have revealed no threatening levels of heavy metals in the air, soil or water in the vicinity of these companies. It therefore appears that the Temporary Regulations OEQC is considering do not address real threats to the long- or short-term health of citizens, but, instead threaten responsible/responsive manufacturers due to a loose, â€œbroad-brushâ€&#65533; approach. To curtail or threaten these corporate citizensâ€™ viability without a clearly delineated threat, would force an unnecessary hardship upon them, their workforces and the local economy, not to mention their customers around the world â€“ all with no apparent benefit to the environment.

I trust that the ultimate outcome of the discussion of these Temporary Regulations will be, not their enactment, but a realistic assessment of actual environmental threats. I am assured by both Bullseye Glass Company and Uroboros Glass that they stand ready and willing to make their workplaces and surroundings even safer than they are today in response to accurate scientific assessments. After such testing, should heavy metal contamination be revealed, a reliable science-based strategy can then be devised for the ongoing mitigation of heavy metals from the pristine environment for which Oregon is famous.

I trust you will be able to avoid throwing babies (such as Bullseye and Uroboros) out with the bath water. Best wishes in your important work!

Ironically, they have been innovative precisely because they are a very careful scientific leader in developing new materials and techniques.  Please approach your assessment the same way.

Please find ways to filter the air or other protective filtration requirements before banning it completely.  People's jobs and businesses are at stake, and its hard enough already to restore these Historic Cathedrals that adorn all of our towns and cities in a respectful and correct way without banning the materials that are needed to complete the job.  This is not going to only affect a craft that many people do in their homes, schools and small business such as lamp and lighting industries, small art glass business and major historic restoration companies like ours. Look around at the windows in a church the amount of green that is used.   It is our hope that you would regulate without an agenda, either left or right and visit all filtration options before banning the substance that creates one of if not the most popular color glass that is in high demand.  Please reach out to University of Arizona Industrial Engineering school to figure out a filtration system to safeguard any legit findings that you have to protect the communities around these glass making plants if the need is there as the health and safety of all of us are of utmost concern but not even trying to filter before you make a move to destroy so may jobs and business in this country is not in the best interest of all.

We strongly support Bullseye on this matter. In our dealings with their team, we have seen nothing but the utmost diligence and thoughtfulness on all matters, but especially on matters of safety. In the glass industry today, there is no other company with Bullseye's commitment in it's attention to detail regarding issues of safety. It's clear from the moment one steps into their facility.

andrew,young,ayoung@pearlriverglass.com,Pearl River Glass Studio ,MS,"I am writing this letter in support of the art glass manufacturing industry in Oregon.  Our company, Pearl River Glass Studio, has been in business for over 40 years.  The art glass that my company buys from both Uroboros and Bullseye Glass has been an important part of the artistic success of what we make and do for our customers. 

I am urging the Department of Environmental Quality to not unduly regulate this small but important industry in Oregon.  I was in Portland last summer for the annual conference of the Stained Glass Association of America.  Our group toured both the Uroboros and Bullseye glass factories.  My impression was that both companies were very worker and environmentally conscious.  Their facilities were well maintained, orderly, and clean.  In order to produce the beautiful material I use in making art it would have to be.  Both companies have been vital parts of the Portland social and economic climate for decades. It is not in their best interest to be anything but the best possible corporate citizen.

I further request the DEQ be very circumspect in its deliberations considering the science behind its decisions.  As manufacturers of glass, a very exacting process to guarantee reproducible results in the making of colors, they know the science of the chemicals that they use every day.   My firsthand experience is that these companies run environmentally conscious operations because they work there every day and live with their families in the community.   Placing unwarranted and premature restrictions on their operations puts an entire industry at risk.

This affects me directly as an artist working in glass.  I have a company of 18 people in Jackson, Mississippi.  Our annual payroll is $500,000.00.  The product made by Uroboros and Bullseye is used every day by these artists and craftsman. Recently our state celebrated the year of the creative economy.  The glass manufacturers in Portland are a vital part of this creative economy not only here but across the entire United States and the world. 

My company is currently underway in manufacturing a Holocaust Memorial for a local synagogue.  If these manufacturerâ€™s operations are unduly interrupted then I cannot finish this very important project. 

Thank you very much for considering my opinion in this matter.

Sincerely yours,

The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.

Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk.

However, I hope the concerns and emotions surrounding this issue do not cloud the real time data that is being collected as part of the evaluation of the colored glass industry, both in Oregon and across the country.  Hopefully, that data and the available filtering technology will allow these industries to continue to produce the unique and amazing glass products which are used world wide.  Thank you.",

Randy,Miller,rjaymiller@gmail.com,Citizen,OR,"Bullseye Glass has been operating in the same location for 40 years and 130 families depend upon their employment there. There is no immediate health risk. The recent Oregon Healthy Authority (â€œOHAâ€&#65533;) studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials.  As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1]  OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;

 Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. We support an agreement that is similar to the temporary rules, but unlike the temporary rules, also allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.
 
Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public panic resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.
 
Unreasonable fears should not trump reason-based solutions. The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

Dan,Packard,dan.packard@gmail.com,,WA,"Hi,

I am very concerned about the harmful air emissions that some industries in Portland are sending into the environment. For 15 years, I lived within a half mile directly downwind of the Bullseye glass factory. Our family experienced numerous severe health problems of cancer, abnormal growths, rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, nausea and fatigue, most likely due to the toxic heavy metals this factory has been releasing into the air.

I recall riding by the Bullseye factory periodically by bicycle and smelling obnoxious and repellent odors coming from an open area at the south side of the building on SE Bush street.
Since moving away from Portland, the unhealthy symptoms I experienced have slowly subsided.

I think it is extremely important that DEQ monitor more aggressively the toxins that industrial factories such as Bullseye, are emitting into the air.  Other problem areas, are emissions coming from the ESCO factory in NW Portland (terrible burnt brake lining smell in Portland's downtown and Pearl district areas when winds blow from the Northwest and this factory location).  Another unhealthy air shed is in the vicinity of the Graphic Packaging / Sun Chemical corporation in North Portland, near I-5, the Expo Center and Delta Park.

These companies are required by law to report the toxins they are pumping into the air we breath.  Why isnâ€™t DEQ connecting the dots and monitoring the air in these unhealthy areas to protect our health and welfare? Why today, does the State of Oregon allow businesses to continue to release toxic chemicals and metals into the air without any regulatory oversight? 

Finally, it IS possible to operate successfully without polluting the air to such a drastic degree.  A case in point is the glass factory in the Seattle area, regulated by the Washington Department of Ecology, with baghouses limiting noxious air emissions (source, The Portland Mercury, Daniel Forbes, March 4, 2016 writing about Spectrum Glass, Woodinville, WA, and in the company website, http://www.spectrumglass.com/stained-glass/CleanAirEfforts.asp).

Monitoring, disclosing, and eliminating harmful air emissions in Portland, and Oregon should be DEQâ€™s number one priority.  The lively health and safety for everyone is paramount.  I hope no one has to go through the unnecessary agony our family has experienced breathing unhealthy air full of toxic metals and the resulting detrimental health consequences caused by this.  These are important questions and points that should be addressed promptly by policy makers, health officials, and quite frankly, the polluting industries themselves.

Harry & Erna,Sowersby,info@creative-glass.com,Creative Glass AG,Switzerland," We are distressed about the news which we get from Portland Oregon with regard to the planned temporary rules issued by the DEQ. Our company is based in Switzerland and we have been customers of Bullseye Glass for over 35 years and to a lesser degree also of Uroboros Glass. In this time we have known both factories to be very serious and environmentally conscientious manufacturers as well as good business people. 

What concerns us about the proposed temporary rules is a lack of scientific facts on the factoriesâ€™ exhaust fumes. The DEQâ€™s approach seems to be entirely based on fears expressed by the factoryâ€™s neighbourhood. According to test results published in early March, the soil around the Bullseye factory is normal for Portland and there is no cause for public concern. There is also no evidence of any increased cancer risk according this same study. Despite these findings Bullseye are putting in additional filtration. 

If the proposed temporary rules become operational Bullseye Glass would have to reduce their product pallet by about 50% for a duration of 180 days, which could threaten their survival. This potentially means that over 100 families in Portland would loose their livelihood. The Bullseye products are essential supplies for many other companies and their artisan customers, thousands of jobs in US and around the world would be at risk. In our own small company 30 jobs would be at risk.

Bullseye glass products are used in glass art, architecture and artisansâ€™ products. Both Bullseye and Uroboros and many artisansâ€™ studios have established Portland as an acknowledged centre for glass art worldwide. In particular, the energy Bullseye Glass brought forward led to a new movement in contemporary glass art with new forms of expression and application. There is a distinctive risk that this movement would lose momentum, which would mean a big loss in the cultural life of Portland, the US and many places in the world. 

Over the last 35 years we have travelled to Portland Oregon on a yearly basis, mostly to visit the factories but also to attend Becon, the biannual glass art conference organized by Bullseye and visited by hundreds of artists, architects and educators. Portland has always appeared to be a very open and energetic city with a dynamic environment for small and middle sized businesses, a great cultural programme as well as a strong feeling of opportunity.

We strongly believe that DEQâ€™s temporary rules could endanger a unique glass movement which has brought Portland into the vocabulary of glass artists worldwide. This arbitrary action (without any scientific proof) could evoke a negative perception of how local government agencies operate.
We think that the good name of Portland deserves better than this.

sandra,Gross,sandragrossart@gmail.com,brazee street studios,ohio,"I write to give you a few glimpse of what I know as Bullseye Glass Company.  I view this company from multiple perspectives: an artist, customer, teacher and as a friend. 

Artist: Bullseye Glass is one of the most beautiful and carefully manufactured materials I have worked with.  I have worked with paper, bronze and glass in my tenure as a professional artist. Of all of those materials, the consistency and quality of the product is of the utmost importance.  I remember the first time I went to the factory and realized they tested every 10th sheet and studied its quality with a high-powered polariscope. That was very impressive to me as an artist who relied on this product to make a living. 

Customer: There are many times Bullseye has completely impressed me with customer service and they still answer the phone!!! One of the most important times they answered the phone was about 6 years ago.  I was working on a mural for the Ronald McDonald House and the glass had to go into the kiln to stay on schedule for the install. I had to go out for a week to teach somewhere else.  I instructed my husband to just fire the kiln with the last program. I figured he is a professional in another field (medicine) so he can figure this out.  He got nervous so he called Bullseye Glass.  Now, we had not bought the kiln from Bullseye.  That did not matter.  A person from the Research and Development Department got on the phone and very kindly talked my husband through the kiln firing process. 

Teacher:  I teach very young children- 3 years and up. For the past 12 years, I have had the privilege to teach 1000s of children Art (all aspects) and other subjects (Literature, Science, some Math) using Bullseye Glass.  I donâ€™t know if it is the beauty, permanence, transformative qualities or all of this but it has a power that no other material has. It allows children to fail (try things that may not work)) and succeed by giving children the power to experiment and play.  It allows children to work with a beautiful and permanent material. It allows children to be as transformed as the material every time you put it into the kiln.  I have always seen how children feel empowered when using the material but most recently I saw it on a very acute level. I teach in a subsidized housing community in an enrichment program that is based on the Montessori Method.  I have the materials out on the shelf like any other material in a classroom.  Children can choose it if they wish and the lessons on the shelf have various themes- color, line, etc. One of the children in the class has a receptive language delay so she finds it hard to express herself verbally as well as following multiple step directives.  The children have all been given the lesson: which includes safety, multiple step process with each material (Montessori lesson plans have many steps) and a place to store their finished work to go into the kiln.  This child carries out each lesson, helps others and artistically has one of the most distinct voices I have ever seen.  Her work always has the same feel and rhythm like voice has. You know it is her work.  We have given her an opportunity to speak and work on developing her voice- the language of glass. 

Friend:  I have been fortunate to spend some time at the owner of Bullseyes home. We spent countless hours discussing the ins and outs of education, children and making a difference.  I also had the opportunity to travel with one of the owners when doing an installation with children in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Again, many hours of conversation on education and helping children.  These are kind, genuine people who deeply care about artists, children, and the environment. 

      My hope is that from these brief glimpses, you will see the importance of Bullseye glass not only as material but also as a company.  Please allow them to modernize their machinery and place the necessary filters so that glass production can begin again.

As a new, small business in Springfield, Missouri, if I am unable to get sufficient quantities of glass from Bullseye I will literally go out of business and my 4 employees will lose their livelihoods.  The very nature of glass fusion means that I need glass that is compatible so I use Bullseye glass in my studio.  
I know the proposed regulations are not targeted only at Bullseye, but they are targeted at the very niche art glass industry that is dependent on glass produced primarily in the Portland, Oregon, area.  Creating an environment that endangers your art glass industry will have a broader negative impact on your region than you may anticipate.  Besides the ripples this would create throughout the US in glass studios from coast to coast that are dependent on the art glass produced in your town.
I understand that recently discovered safety concerns must be addressed, but since there is no imminent danger, please do your due diligence and not rush to regulate.  Make sure that any new regulations are necessary, aimed at the correct industry and are implemented in a timely fashion that will not cripple our industry.

To shut down production of art glass by the two companies in Portland, even temporarily, would have the potential to put many small businesses as well as individual artists out of business across the country. As a small, family owned business the current strain has already been impacting our ability to function. Due to the pause in manufacturing of many colors of glass, the cost of replacing those colors has doubled, and many colors have become completely unavailable. My livelihood depends upon the ability to obtain the full spectrum of glass colors and provide them to my customers at a reasonable cost, something I am barely able to do under the current circumstances and which will become impossible with this ""temporary"" ruling. 
I speak for the many small businesses across the country and for the artists trying hard to make a living through their work - this temporary measure will put many of us out of business. There is no alternative source, these small businesses supply the world with their glass color and without them our businesses will close, not temporarily but permanently.",

This shows that there is very little interest in actually addressing the root of the problem. This is about punishing those parties that received the most attention in the media.

Do not adopt rules that could potentially cause a venerable Portland institution like Bullseye Glass to lay off workers or go out of business.
Bullseye has been cooperative with DEQ and has enacted voluntary suspensions of use of certain metals since the initial editorials were posted in early February on the Portland Mercuryâ€™s â€œBlogtownâ€&#65533; website. Please work with Bullseye rather than enforcing a set of hastily written rules created by people with an extremely limited and haphazard understanding of the science behind the manufacturing process.

The processing the is used by Bullseye glass is not of the temps that would cause the conversion of metals into the toxic form you are trying to protect.  This measure would be throwing the baby out with the bath water.
The actions of companies to address emissions should be strongly considered.
This is a strong move that will impact not only companies in your state but resellers and artist across the country.

Based on this information alone, if the poisons you say, arsenic for example, are in the air and affecting everyone why is he still alive? Arsenic is a known poison that kills us after enough has entered our systems.  An 85 year old has had at least 40 years of exposure should not be alive.

Now you are assuming that a different form of chromium chemical is produced prior to even running tests.  I think this is quite biased for a government agency to take a stand on.

My understanding of articles written is there is a gap in the regulations currently; however, it has not been proven that in Bullseye's production they are currently in violation.  The gap in the regulations is not the fault of the business but DEQ and Bullseye should not be accountable for this DEQ error.  Bullseye has not been in violation of the regulations.  The people living around the facility are also to be blamed.  They moved in knowing that there was a facility producing glass.  This is not something they were not aware of and if they were they didn't research the neighborhood before moving into it.  From what I have seen a lot of the homes are run down and not kept up.  
As the production of the glass has not been found to be in violations of the current regulations, they should not held at fault.  The DEC/EQC should work with the facility to come to an agreement on how and in what time frame any problems can be corrected without financially crippling the facility.  I believe the temporary rules for the small glass companies should not go into affect until they are found at fault for violating the regulations.  Just because it may doesn't mean it will and any effects won't be discovered until years from now.  Let's all work together and not cripple business on something that has not yet been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Remember innocent until proven guilty and they have not been.

John,Poole,jlpoole56@gmail.com,,California,"Dear Commissioner Members,

California has driven so many industries out of state all under the mantra of improving the environment.  There has been no working with industry.   But the well-intentioned movers and shakers have thrown the baby out with the bathwater and I think the general population is starting to realize it, we have lost so many industries.  Try to find a place to cast metal work?  No dice, you have to go out of state because the air quality regulations shut down foundry work.  Of course, the politicians in Sacramento will never agree that is the case lest it reflect poorly on their predecessors decision or alarm the ever so intense feeling about the environment.  There are social costs that never get measured or show up on the balance sheet, except on a manufacture's sheet where it might cost monies to mitigate.  This is where government drops the ball.

You have a very special industry in your state: art glass.  If I thought they could have a chance moving production to California at this time, I would urge you to move forward so they would relocate in California.  People do not realize what they have lost until after it is too late.  Please do not make that mistake.  There has to be some way for Oregon's air quality to work with industry to keep industry and the excellence of this unusual product going.  Perhaps making decisions on ""likelies"", as in "" are added likely emit these metals at levels"" of your notice above in this form, should be be postponed until you have facts.  When you get the facts, then make your decision, but keep in mind what government can do to work with industry and finding ways to mitigate potential problems.  

Perhaps having government share the burden of mitigating hazards defined under new legislation should be considered.  There is no right to pollute, but as society increases its awareness of hazards, it ought to look at the entire picture and consider mitigation as an expense everyone should bear.  Show California what California failed to do by working with the art glass manufacturers.

Bob,Heath,bob@arttouch.com,None,Oregon,"My name is Bob Heath. I am a Portland area glass artist, but I am not employed by any glass company nor have I ever been. I attended the hearing on March 15, 2016 where the DEQ presented its request for granting of a temporary rule restricting the use by Colored Art Glass Manufacturers (CAGMs) of Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium and Nickle to the EQC.
I felt at the time that the temporary rule was unjustified based on the available evidence and the fact that the two largest glass manufacturers in Portland had already voluntarily stopped using the metals in question. Two days after that hearing, the DEQ announced results of its more recent air monitoring which showed that levels of those metals had dropped dramatically, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the glass companiesâ€™ voluntary actions.
The DEQ recommendation to the EQC requesting adoption of the temporary rules was based on the premise that â€œfailure to act promptly would result in serious prejudice to the public interest or the interests of the parties concernedâ€&#65533;.
Following the release of the most recent air monitoring results, The Oregon Health Authority stated, â€œNone of the sampling results were higher than the Oregon 24-hour screening levels, meaning that there is no immediate or urgent health risk related to these new results, according to an Oregon Health Authority (OHA) toxicologist.â€&#65533;
Given this statement from the OHA, it is clear that the case for taking the extreme action of adopting a temporary rule no longer exists, if it ever did.  The voluntary actions taken by the CAGMs have quite clearly mitigated any immediate risk, even before the DEQ request for adoption of the temporary rule. Considering what the data have shown, it would be truly inappropriate for the DEQ to repeat the request for the same temporary rule that it made previously. 
The CAGMs do not pose a threat to the community. They have shown good will and achieved excellent results as they work to improve their systems for cleaner air. The new filtering systems represent a huge investment for these glass companies, at a time when their income is dramatically reduced due to their voluntary production cuts. Time is of the essence for these companies. They must get their pollution controls installed and operating as quickly as possible or risk going out of business entirely. If that were to happen, it would be a loss not only for their employees and local glass artists like me, but for thousands of glass artists and glass art businesses world-wide that depend on these Portland companies for their unique type of glass. Iâ€™m not exaggerating when I say that the entire world art glass community is watching what happens here and hoping that fear based reporting and local politics do not destroy their livelihood and possibly an entire art form.
The DEQ will need to approve plans, then test and verify the effectiveness of CAGM pollution controls as they are implemented. The DEQ can set an example as an effective agency that values the health of both the community and the businesses that the community depends on by expediting its actions with respect to that planning and testing.
The imposition of additional regulations on the CAGMs at this time, after they have been shown to be unnecessary, would not result in cleaner air, but might very well have dire consequences for these companies and the many people that depend on them.

Tracey,Bewley,traceybewley@gmail.com,Art Fusion Studio,Oklahoma,"This is an improper use of temporary rule making. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.

There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1] OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;[2]

Further, DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;[3]

DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;
 
Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

With minor changes to correct scientific errors and omissions in the currently proposed rule, Bullseye Glass is willing to sign an agreement that achieves all of DEQâ€™s goals and allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.

Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public concern resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.

The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. We support an agreement that is similar to the temporary rules, but unlike the temporary rules, also allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

Bullseye Glass Co. has a payroll of $7.5 million dollars. 130 Portland families and 20 other Bullseye families depend on Bullseye for jobs. Hundreds of Oregon artists and craftspeople depend upon Bullseye products. Tens of thousands of artists across the United States and the world depend upon Bullseye products.",

Also, many of these comments quote Dr. LaCourse as a reference that CrIII does not convert to CrVI. Dr. LaCourse himself has stated ""Unfortunately I know a quite a bit about glass, but not much about environmental testing. In general the method would be determined by the objective.....e.g. Long term vs short term and ""all sources"" vs specific sources."" Given his admitted lack of knowledge on environmental testing, I believe its erroneous to quote him as a source. 

The socially responsible course is to follow the precautionary principle and regulate known toxics cautiously. Requiring that a certain percentage of the population acquire cancer before taking action seems not only perverse, but an ethically slippery slope.

Catharine,Newell,catharine.newell@comcast.net,Catharine Newell Studio,OR,"I stand with Bullseye Glass in its efforts to continue operations as a responsible citizen of the business and social community of Portland, Oregon. 
As a longtime Portland artist, gratefully using Bullseye glass materials, I understand that a progressive studio practice is never centered around inexperience, haste and ignorance. Rather, studio work is a progressive and detailed conversation about what actually is, where it can be taken and how best to move forward to a successful resolution.
As a Portland community member, I consider our conversation to be the same.
DEQâ€™s push for a temporary rule is misguided and dangerous. Rather than supporting the safety of our community and offering clear guidance to local businesses, the DEQ is offering the opposite â€“ unfounded placation and hasty supposition. My neighbors and I are considering the future with trepidation. If the temporary rule were to prevail, Portlanders would be faced with a patchwork of legislative approaches that would likely put Bullseye Glass out of business and still not address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues in an efficient and appropriate manner. 
The Oregon Health Authority and the Multnomah County Health Department have stated that there is no immediate health risk to our community. Excellent. Instead of instituting a discriminatory and improperly posited temporary rule, DEQ now has the time to focus upon creating permanent and effective rules, based on scientific investigation and thoughtful process.
Bullseye Glass is already doing just that. In addition to proactive action involving emission controls, Bullseye is, in fact (with minor corrections to scientific errors and omissions in the currently proposed rule), willing to sign an agreement that fulfills all of DEQâ€™s goals and allows both entities to respond promptly to new factual information.
And DEQ? DEQ is pushing a temporary rule that asks CAGMâ€™s to melt Cr in oxidizing conditions, guaranteeing Cr conversion. This testing is not based on glass making practices, proves nothing and is, in fact, contradictory to scientific study related to Bullseyeâ€™s furnaces. What is needed is specific testing to determine Bullseyeâ€™s actual monitored emissions with a baghouse in place. Once those emissions are determined, all parties will clearly understand how to logically and safely proceed. 
Fear is rooted in ignorance, promotes careless action, engenders substandard results and puts genuinely excellent business practices at risk. A temporary ruling would be based on fear, not facts. I urge DEQ to move forward in an intelligent and responsible manner by thoroughly investigating the realities of this situation, via extensive scientific inquiry prior to making a ruling that will stand the test of time.

I hope the source of these chemicals will be found as soon as possible and further production stopped. At the same time, there appears to be vastly insufficient evidence that the glass manufacturing in the area is the source of these unacceptable levels of Cr(VI). To have Bullseye Glass temporarily stop production of all glass which utilizes CR(III), is a knee-jerk reaction not based in scientific findings. This measure could actually lull the community into a false sense of security, as the true source of Cr(VI) has not been determined. Bullseye has voluntarily  started installing filtration systems for the furnaces, and has invited monitoring to ensure community safety. Please consider the livelihood of Bullseye glass employees and artists across the country [and internationally], before implementing unfair and ineffective interventions for this serious situation.

Ethan,Ogle,ethanogle@gmail.com,EPAC,Oregon,"Thank you for extending the time for public comment on the proposed temporary rules.  I believe DEQ should adopt temporary rules that prohibit the uncontrolled emissions of hazardous air pollutants (â€œHAPsâ€&#65533;) from industrial facilities. The proposed temporary rules could be significantly improved and strengthened:

1)  The wording in the temporary rules often seems vague, using terms like â€œwill probably installâ€&#65533; and â€œDEQ and OHA believe to be safe for the public.""  Coming from regulatory agencies centered on public health, I would like to see these phrases become much more black and white.
2)  There appears to be no enforceable penalty provision. There needs to be specific, quantifiable penalties for breaking the rules, with enough gravity to compel compliance.  This would better reflect a public health based approach to regulation, instead of the apparent protection of industry to the detriment of the public.
3)  The proposed rules should apply to the entire State of Oregon, not just the City of Portland.  On that same note, the proposed rules should apply to the many other industrial polluters, and not only focus on CAGM's.
4)  ""If DEQ does not deny or approve the Notice of Intent to Construct within 10 days after receiving the Notice, the Notice will be deemed to be approved.""  This needs to be completely reversed, the Notice should be denied.  No response means NO.  Additionally, the public should have a full and fair opportunity to review that information and to provide comments on the draft permit.  Only then should DEQ issue the permit, thereby authorizing emissions of heavy metals.

Again, thank you for allowing ample time for public comment, and also thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this matter.  With all parties involved having opportunity to voice their opinions, I am certain we can reach an outcome that benefits everyone: citizens, employees, and businesses alike.",

Kyle,Day,daykyle@gmail.com,,OR,"I do not supporr the EPA regulatory loophole that Bullseye created for glass companies. I support the temporary DEQ regulations.

EPA lists glass factories as one of the top 5 industries of concern between coal and petroleum stating:

""There are approximately 125 large glass plants operating in the United States. These plants emit approximately 200,000 tons per year of NOx, SO2 and particulate matter (PM). Investigation of this sector has shown that there have been a significant number of plant expansions but few applications for the installation of pollution controls required under NSR/PSD.""

https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/air-enforcement

This is a known issue by the EPA and this issue has been known and buried for decades by the DEQ.

As you know, the DEQ detected arsenic at 159 times the government safety level benchmark and cadmium at 49 times the safety benchmark.

The IMT, along with the DEQ, OHA, Multnomah County, and other organizations are attempting to quell public concerns by modifying benchmarks where they see fit. This type of behavior is of great concern to me.

Furthermore, while soil testing has looked encouraging for the most part, some residents gardens are showing elevated levels of metals in plant tissues. The DEQ/OHA are claiming the soil is safe for gardening, but as far as I know, they haven't done plant tissue analysis.

Nevertheless, rules on air emissions should not be based on soil readings. They should be based on air testing â€“ which was ""unprecedented"" and ""magnitudes higher"" than the DEQ had ever seen in the past. Let us not forget what the initial data conveyed. The initial data, along with the recent air data suggest that Bullseye Glass and Uroboros need pollution controls. Precision Cast Parts must not be forgotten either.",

Tracy,Sawyer,travelintrace@hotmail.com,,Oregon,"As a SE Portland resident living near Bullseye Glass, I support EPAC's comments that have been submitted. 

The DEQ's mission statement says the DEQ is to protect our air, land and water. In order to achieve this mission, DEQ must base the regulations of glass manufacturers on standards that lead to zero emissions of toxins in our environment and not based on industry thresholds in their productions. In other words, DEQ should be setting limits based on health standards and not on what works within industryâ€™s manufacturing process.

Small manufacturers must filter all emissions just as larger manufacturers must. The same stringent guidelines should be put into place and enforced regardless of the size of the manufacturer.

The temporary rules should include the filtering of nickel. 

The temporary rules should start at once and not wait until Sept 1st, which allows industry to pollute our air for 5 more months. 

DEQ should require companies to test Every controlled and uncontrolled outlet stack to ensure that no toxic emissions are overlooked. 

It is important that steep enforceable fines are clearly noted in the temporary rules so that industry has a clear incentive to follow the new rules. 

True level of compliance must also be achieved by clandestine air monitoring, thorough toxicity testing through moss and soil sampling, plus blood/urine testing of those living nearby to get an accurate assessment of contamination and to ensure that our environment is properly cleaned up. A thorough assessment of contamination has not bee done and needs to occur immediately.

Emissions should be tested for Chromium VI as there seems to be no clarity on whether it is being created in emissions. 

Finally, these new regulations should include small and medium sized manufacturers in other industries as well to truly improve our air, land and water quality. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the temporary rules.

* There appears to be no enforceable penalty provision. There needs to be specific quantifiable penalties for breaking the rules. This is important because you can make all the rules you want and if there are no penalties, basically no one cares.
* Are glassmakers getting the summer off, since no permits would be required until Sept 2016? The requirement should be effective immediately, with a 30-day or similar grace period.
* There should be a provision for similar emitters no matter what product they are producing. No loopholes.
* The DEQ may be willing to fix one of their mistakes from 2007 loopholes for Bullseye, but if they cannot do so with a transparent process that centers on the communities most at risk and provide them with a seat at the table that allows them to protect their own health, then no one can honestly say that their culture has changed.
* We are also concerned that this temporary rule only covers art glass manufactures and not other major polluters in the Portland Metro area.
* Also, the rules are so inconsistent when identifying which material is toxic. In one place they mention that the EPA lists 188 HAPs, then they're only concerned about their fave 3, then it's also nickel. There isn't any logic.
* How are ""fugitive emissions"" emissions that don't go up the stack but into the room or open air when doors are open, being monitored and filtered?
* How are gaseous emissions being monitored and remediated, such as fluorine? A filter most likely would not capture this.

Lynn,Short,LMShort@comcast.net,,Georgia,"I am writing in support of Bullseye and Uroboros Glass.  Considering your concern with chromium:  Many of the green glasses Bullseye makes include Chromium compounds that contain trivalent chromium (Cr+3), a naturally occurring element. Cr+3 can oxidize to dangerous hexavalent chromium (Cr+6) under certain conditions. However, if that happens, the glass doesn't come out green as intended, so their manufacturing process includes steps to ensure the chromium remains in its safe trivalent state.  (Note:  chromium is used in making all green glass, including wine bottles.)   Chromium (Cr+3) in glass making does not oxidize to the +6 state unless the glass engineer wants it to. He/she has a lot control over what happens. If it did convert, the glass would not have the right color and would be useless.  Both Bullseye and Uroboros glassmakers are very careful and responsible, and make fantastic glass enjoyed by many, many people, including myself, who use this glass in their career or hobby.  I understand these glassmakers are making modifications to their equipment which will render it even safer than it had been.  Please work with these companies to ensure they can continue making a much needed and much appreciated material which is safely produced.  As an employer in your area, and a valuable resource nation-wide, the good people of Bullseye and Uroboros Glass deserve your assistance in ensuring they may continue producing their wonderful glass.  If they are forced to close their business, we glass-workers will be forced to purchase our glass from other makers in the US or abroad.

I have been an employee at Bullseye Glass since 2001 and I have always felt completely safe and confident in our companyâ€™s efforts to operate in an environmentally conscious way.  There are safety protocols in all areas of our operation and we have always had an excellent safety record.  
The owners, Dan Schwoerer and Lani McGregor have built this company from very humble beginnings, in its current location.  They created Bullseye with a high level of integrity, have always focused on making a quality product and offering the best service to our customers, while also creating a safe, health conscious and excellent work place for their employees.  
Dan is 73 years old and has been working at the factory every day for the last 42 years.  He is not only one of the healthiest people I know, he is also one of the most honest and a true man of his word.  If he says he is going to do something, not only does he get it done, he does it in the best way possible.
I have always been very proud to be part of all that Bullseye Glass is and represents.  Bullseye Glass is a small company.  Because of Bullseyeâ€™s pioneering spirit, it created a new art medium and new market for art glass, and therefore has worldwide influence.   This sometimes makes it appear much larger than it actually is.    Bullseye is not a giant, industrial corporation. The owners and employees of Bullseye Glass are hard-working, everyday people with families, much like all of our neighbors in the community.  The company culture is more like being part of a family rather than employees of a factory.  Dan and Lani interact with us every day, they know us, they know our families and not only do they appreciate us, they care about our futures. 
If you implement these temporary rules, even though the Oregon Health Authority has already stated that there is no immediate health risk, you are putting my job and my coworkersâ€™ jobs in very real jeopardy.
We are Portlanders.  We are a company of makers.  If you shut us down, you are shutting down part of Portlandâ€™s history and eliminating a cottage industry that prides itself in being American made.  
We can co-exist and lead the way in the future of air quality standards in Portland. I have complete trust that Dan and Lani will spend all of their energy and the necessary expense to put the best emission controls in place for the safety of Bullseye employees, our families and our neighbors.  
Please give us the time to complete our state of the art emission controls and maintain our business.

Ruslan,Kanonik,kanonik@yahoo.com,-,"Saint-Petersburg, RF",I can't vote against the new rules if the threat to the health of local people is proven. But I want DEQ to use facts and not speculation on new rules. I order Uroboros glass across half of the globe and as a person who interested in stained glass I hope for your fair decision.,
Jennifer ,Jones,thejonesfour@mac.com,Eastside Portland Air Coalition,Oregon,"* The wording in the temporary rule seems vague using terms like â€œwill probably installâ€&#65533; and â€œDEQ and OHA believe to be safe for the public.
* There appears to be no enforceable penalty provision. There needs to be specific quantifiable penalties for breaking the rules. This is important because you can make all the rules you want and if there are no penalties, basically no one cares.
* Are glassmakers getting the summer off, since no permits would be required until Sept 2016? The requirement should be effective immediately, with a 30-day or similar grace period.
* There should be a provision for similar emitters no matter what product they are producing. No loopholes.
* The DEQ may be willing to fix one of their mistakes from 2007 loopholes for Bullseye, but if they cannot do so with a transparent process that centers on the communities most at risk and provide them with a seat at the table that allows them to protect their own health, then no one can honestly say that their culture has changed.
* We are also concerned that this temporary rule only covers art glass manufactures and not other major polluters in the Portland Metro area.
* Also, the rules are so inconsistent when identifying which material is toxic. In one place they mention that the EPA lists 188 HAPs, then they're only concerned about their fave 3, then it's also nickel. There isn't any logic.
* How are ""fugitive emissions"" emissions that don't go up the stack but into the room or open air when doors are open, being monitored and filtered?
* How are gaseous emissions being monitored and remediated, such as fluorine? A filter most likely would not capture this.
* City of Portland and Multnomah County adopted the precautionary principle in 2004/2006. Please be reminded of that commitment. ",

I moved to Oregon in April of 2015 because of this glass history and access to Bullseye.  When I first visited their factory I was impressed by their clean store and production facilities.  In addition, the service and knowledge sharing was outstanding.

Many people complain that industry is moving overseas and taking jobs with them.  Here in Portland we have a company that produces magnificent glass made by US Citizens. Bullseye offers classes by renown artists that brings people from around the country to our city.

 I find it amazing that regulations would be set based on non scientific facts.  If Bullseye is made to close then Portland will lose jobs and  tourism and it will rip the heart out of the glass art community.

Dr. LaCourse himself has stated ""Unfortunately I know a quite a bit about glass, but not much about environmental testing. In general the method would be determined by the objective.....e.g. Long term vs short term and ""all sources"" vs specific sources."" Given his admitted lack of knowledge on environmental testing, I believe its erroneous to quote him as a source.

Cory,Cairn,,,OR,"As a resident of the neighborhood impacted by Bullseyeâ€™s decades of uncontrolled heavy â€&#381;metal emissions, I reviewed the proposed temporary rules and have the following comments:â€&#381;

â€&#381;1) The temporary rules allow the use of nickel in uncontrolled furnaces prior to the permit â€&#381;application deadline of September 1st.  Nickel needs to be added to the immediate operating â€&#381;restrictions prior to the emission control installation/approval deadline.â€&#381;

â€&#381;2) Chromium III to chromium VI conversion must be tested in worst case conditions.  â€&#381;Unless the glassmaking industry can demonstrate to you that oxidizing combustion conditions â€&#381;cannot possibly occur with their practices, you must keep the current chromium conversion â€&#381;testing requirements.  Emission control requirements must be based off of potentiality for harm â€&#381;through accident or equipment malfunction and not just standard daily practices.â€&#381;

â€&#381;3) Permitting the use of chromium III in uncontrolled furnaces (following the â€&#381;establishment of maximum allowable usage rate) does not account for potential atmospheric and â€&#381;soil conversion.  Neighborhoods already heavily impacted by unregulated emissions from these â€&#381;industries should not be the testing grounds for â€œgood enoughâ€&#65533; emission control requirements â€&#381;regarding less-understood pollutant conversion conditions.  Chromium III should only be â€&#381;allowed to be melted in controlled furnaces.â€&#381;

â€&#381;4) The rules only require source testing on one controlled furnace per facility to â€&#381;demonstrate compliance.  Bullseye has acknowledged that smaller baghouses like the one they â€&#381;are currently installing are â€œrelatively new territory for the professionals [they] are working with.â€&#65533;  â€&#381;It is too risky to allow hazardous air pollutants to be used in a furnace with an untested emission â€&#381;control device.  Every controlled furnace used to melt cadmium, arsenic, chromium, or nickel â€&#381;needs to be source tested to demonstrate compliance.â€&#381;

â€&#381;5) Stiff enforceable penalties need to be added for violators of the temporary rules, as â€&#381;these issues are well known and understood by the affected businesses.  It is impossible to â€&#381;imagine that any violation would not be willful.â€&#381;

â€&#381;6) These proposed regulations need to be extended to small and medium facility polluters â€&#381;in other industries besides colored art glass manufacturing.  Emitters of hazardous air pollutants â€&#381;need to enact appropriate emission controls for public safety as the expected cost of doing â€&#381;business.  Ignoring other industries after the glass-making hotspots have been addressed would â€&#381;be unacceptable and have a deleterious effect on public health.â€&#381;

Ben,Stabley,quillaja@hotmail.com,,OR,"I've been an employee for Bullseye for about 2.5 years. I also have a B.S. in Environmental Science from the Rochester Institute of Technology, for what that's worth as an illustration that I have some idea about environmental issues. 

First, I do think this proposed ""temporary"" rule has no concrete evidence behind it, and is motivated largely by political pressure and public fear stirred up by a sensational news media. In fact, your own investigations have shown the health risk to be minimal, despite the temporary rule stating that there are ""serious health effects"".  

Second, Bullseye Glass has been in compliance with existing regulations. Although regulations can change, Bullseye needs some time in order to install proper pollution control measures. I always thought it was odd that the factory did not have some sort of filtration system installed, but assumed (correctly) that the company was operating legally. I think it is wonderful that Bullseye is now installing pollution control systems. However, this ""temporary"" rule is hasty, sudden, and irrational. It targets a small number of specific businesses--that were complying with the law--and ignores other potential sources of pollution. 

Furthermore, from my perspective as an employee, Bullseye has bent over backwards to work with the DEQ in response to the issue. Bullseye voluntarily suspended use of cadmium, lead, arsenic, and chrome, and is also voluntarily begun the process of installing pollution controls. I suppose it would have been possibly for the company to simply say ""we're in compliance"" and continue using these materials. 

As it stands, Bullseye is currently producing less than 50% of its product line, taking significant revenue loss while simultaneously spending untold sums on pollution controls AND continuing to employ all of its 140 employees. I believe Dan Schwoerer, the owner of Bullseye, is doing more than most in his position would do to operate a responsible business and protect us employees. 

My fear is that this ""temporary"" rule will strangle an otherwise excellent small business before it has a chance to comply with any new regulations, unfairly targets specific businesses, and ignores other sources of pollutants and the larger overall issue of air quality in Portland and Oregon as a whole.

Bullseye Glass manufactures a wholly unique product. If Bullseye Glass is forced into compliance, we and thousands of others like us, will be forced out of business.

Chromium III is essential to the production of green glass. Scientific evidence shows the use of this compound by Bullseye Glass is not harmful. Nevertheless, the DEQ wants to restrict Bullseye from using Cr(III) for an extended period of time. They are essentially basing these rules off an assumption of guilt without any supporting evidence. 

Neither DEQ or EPA have required any other US producer, of green glass, to entirely and arbitrarily stop their production without notice and perform the kind of extensive testing and modeling that DEQ is asking for. A typical green bottle manufacturer uses 1,000 times more Cr(III) per year than Bullseye Glass. A bottle producer, with emission controls, would melt more Cr(III) each day than Bullseye uses in a year. 

These newly proposed regulations are based on politics and fear, not science. A leading scientist, Dr. LaCourse, has said Bullseye's furnaces do not produce toxic chromium. These regulations could be forced upon Bullseye Glass in the next 24 hours via a temporary rule making procedure by DEQ. 

If Bullseye Glass not allowed to use Cr (III), they can no longer make green glass. On top of their voluntary suspension of cadmium glass production until their baghouse is in place, this new limitation would eliminate 50% of their product line. It would result in employee layoffs, huge economic impacts to Bullseye and could even drive them out of business.

It also impacts us, medium to small businesses and artisans and hobbyists all over the world. We are a new start-up glass business with 5 employees, one of whom has metastasized breast cancer and has not been able to find employment elsewhere, a fifteen year old kid who's dad just passed away and is trying to help his mom, a young woman with chronic lime's disease, a young mom with 50% hearing loss and a woman with scleroderma.

Meg,Ruby,megruby@gmail.com,EPAC and NCA,OR,"Hello,  My Name is Meg Ruby. Please pass temporary rules to stop glass factories from using arsenic, cadmium, chromium (all forms) and nickel.  Know this is only a temporary step. The goal must be to provide adequate protections to prevent exposure to air toxics for the health of all in Portland, and indeed in Oregon.

DEQ must immediately identify/inventory all additional glassmakers in the Portland Metro area and in the state.  DEQ should begin with the Moss Monitoring data and use other resources to find all glass producers. DEQ temporary rules should not be adopted until they are calibrated to be relevant to all glassmakersâ€™ practices in the Portland Metro area and beyond, e.g., product lines, use of metals, firing practices, known emissions, and correlated moss monitor results.  

DEQâ€™s temporary rules for glassmakers must include appropriate provision for all types of glassmakers and their practices and they must include timely and precise monitoring of emissions to document glassmakers are not releasing dangerous toxic emission into our air.  DEQ must focus on the goal of keeping every Oregonian safe. 

DEQ's temporary rules for glassmakers should explicitly require the adoption of  â€˜Best Practicesâ€™ in the industry for filter use, calibration, installation, operation, cleaning and maintenance. 

DEQ itself must also adopt best practices for regulating this industry, for example in the assessment, testing, monitoring, and abating of emissions from glassmakers.

Please adopt best practices in management of all industrial sources contributing to the Portland area toxic air crisis including proposing state of the art regulation of diesel emissions. 

Please keep your focus on solving Oregonâ€™s toxic air debacle.  DEQ must be overhauled, recalibrated and given adequate funding to do the job at hand.  Currently, DEQ has proven to be dysfunctional and captive to the interests of the Associated Oregon Industries (AOI) and their fancy lawyers.  Please leave such practices behind. Fly right.

Ask the Governor/State legislature for the budget needed and permission to bring in the proven leadership. Reboot DEQ into becoming an agency about which we can be proud! This Oregon! DEQ can become the agency we need to protect all Oregonians.

Meg,Ruby,Megruby@gmail.com,"EPAC, NCA ",Oregon,"I am submitting an additional comment to that submitted earlier today. And that is that these temporary rules are in adequate for the following reasons:
The temporary ruled will allow unexplainably for the emission of chromium 6 at levels 20 times less protective than Oregon's established ambient benchmark;
will allow DEQ to unilaterally make decisions that affect human health, including for production to recommence, without adequate public involvement;
will not sufficiently safeguard against ongoing racial injustice and environmental justice disparities caused by toxic air pollution, by too narrowly limiting which facilities will be subject to this rule. ",
Genevieve ,Moore,Sportlandacupuncture@gmail.com,,Or,I stand with EPAC,
Cynthia,Morgan,cynthia@morganica.com,Individual,Oregon,"DEQ's ""temporary"" rules are a hasty and ill-conceived attempt to paper over a significant issue with air quality management in the greater Portland metro area (and, indeed, throughout Oregon): The lack of consistent, science-based regulation and fair application of those regulations to all businesses. These rules are an attempt at damage control without consideration of the real problems. 

Accordingly, DEQ should take the following steps:

1) Develop strong guidelines, based on the latest scientific guidelines, conducting any operation of any size which employs identified HAPs per EPA guidelines. Where legislation does not exist to require emissions/pollution control levels for those businesses, draft such legislation and work with Oregon state legislature to pass it. If needed apply to community action groups for assistance and use the current laws of nearby states (Washington and California) as examples. 

At minimum, such legislation should require businesses to submit to regular independent testing to ensure no/minimal levels of emissions (and, obviously, those levels should be defined). Where levels are exceeded, compliance and remediation should be enforced.

2) Provide expedited review, testing/analysis, and approval of the current glass factory situation to ensure that (a) residents are reassured about the safety of their neighborhood air and soil and (b) glass factories are able to resume safe production as quickly as possible. DEQ can take as long as 18 months to review and approve such permits and plans; I as a citizen would like to make it clear that such delays are abominable here, when so many of DEQ's constituents are relying on the outcome.

3) Make public all test and sampling records, as well as all test and construction plans, related to the ""hotspot"" announcements of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, etc., contamination due to USFS moss research.  

4) Provide clarifying information and continuing test results on other potential sources of contamination in the neighborhood, including but not limited to the local cement transfer station(s) in SE, metal plating factory, Precision Castparts, the Brooklyn railyard construction project, etc. Early DEQ information pointed to the railyard as a potential secondary contamination source but there has been little or no additional news regarding whether there has been followup testing to determine if this is actually the case.

DEQ and its partner OHA have frankly done an atrocious job to date of managing this crisis, with the result that many of my friends, neighbors, co-workers, and vendors have been thrown into financial and emotional crisis. I would love to see DEQ do more than simply hire a $50,000 PR consultant to manage its own image in this regard. It's time to step up and actually manage the air quality in this town correctly.",

I am responding to the Oregon DEQâ€™s offer to accept public commentary regarding proposed implementation of temporary regulations affecting operations of both Bullseye Glass and Uroboros Glass companies in Portland, Oregon.
In contrast to many of the comments you will review, I am neither a resident of Portland nor Oregon. Nor, am I a dedicated user of either companyâ€™s products.
I am, however, an avid glass artisan and a user of art glass primarily from domestic and European sources. In â€œArtworldâ€&#65533;, both Bullseye and Uroboros provide artisans around the world unique opportunities to create fused glass art â€“ with products NOT available elsewhere - period. Both companies occupy a unique niche not otherwise met. Further, putting the viability of either company at risk is putting the art glass community at risk, not only in Oregon and the United States, but with negative worldwide ramifications. 
Based upon everything I have read, it appears that the DEQ is attempting to overcompensate for its having possibly been asleep at the wheel, in terms of overseeing effluents from both manufacturers. It also appears that both companies have followed the letter of existing law in terms of compliance. Extensive and expansive environmental and human sampling has broadly refuted any notion that past decades of operation have resulted in any actionable pollution or risks to health.
As you must know in your heart of hearts, bad science can easily lead to bad politics. Bad politics can easily lead to bad public policy. Bad public policy can easily damage businesses and the public good.
Both companies have signed on to agreements wherein they will bear the costs of installing appropriate air quality devices. I do not know the case for Uroboros, but I do know that Bullseye has been sued by the Keller Rohrback firm out of Seattle, associated with local counsel. Both companies have faced public scrutiny and demonstrations, which may well have distracted them from the business of providing quality products for their worldwide customer base. Both companies have plenty of irons in their fires, without thoughts of facing even more restrictions from the State of Oregon and other governmental agencies.
From the viewpoints based both in reason and science, I ask that any further restrictions or impediments to the business of making glass by either company be set aside. Plainly and obviously, were either company to have, in reality, polluted to the extent of actually compromising public health over decades, the scientific proof would support such contention. Collaterally, allowing both companies to reinstate their normal production over the relatively short period required to design, install, activate, and test the proposed 99% effective baghouses will NOT contribute significantly to the already minimal risks to public health.

Neither have we seen an accounting of the origin or monitoring of such odors. We, as residents of the Cully neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, are concerned that unregulated chemical releases may affect our long term health in a negative way as well as our short-term comfort. This is of special concern given our high population of children and elderly.

Perhaps the DEQ is unaware of the amount and nature of the chemicals being used. If so, please access the following document at http://www.ncair.org/toxics/asphalt/. Granted, this document only addresses toxic air pollutants related to the Porter Yett facility (5949 NE Cully Blvd.) but we hope it may spur on the DEQ to take a more responsive and transparent approach to protect the health of Cully residents. Other industries may be using similar TAPs, toluene and other PAHs yet there seems to be little information about how these TAPs are being addressed. 

Cully, as a community within Oregon, is home to a very diverse and economically vulnerable population, and so we know we have been ignored in the past and many of our residents may have become resigned to the fact that the air around us may be laced with known carcinogens. However, given the recent interest in making DEQ more proactive and efficient in protecting the health of Oregonians, we now demand that the Oregon DEQ restrict Porter Yet and other TAP industries from polluting our air and endangering our health. We would further request increased monitoring and a listing of all known TAPs being used in industrial processes within 1000 feet of the Cully neighborhood boundaries. ",
Jina,K,,,OR,"Portland is quickly losing it's claim to being a green city.  It is time to make air quality a priority in Portland.  For too long the state has knowingly failed to protect the city's residents who live in areas with the highest levels of toxic air pollution, and too often poor people and communities of color are at the highest risk.  We want DEQ to do it's job of air quality management to ensure clean safe air for all of our residents. Thank you for your attention to this critical public safety and community livability issue.""",
Dawn,Smallman,velvethammer00@hotmail.com,,OR,"I'm writing to encourage DEQ to adopt stronger temporary rules that go much further in protecting public health than the ones currently proposed. We need a more conservative chromium level than the level being proposed. We need a process that ensures public involvement and comment periods. Members of our community need to have a place as stakeholders at the table - to be included as decision-makers on all critical, key decisions in crafting both temporary and long-term rules concerning toxic emission standards. Any and all temporary and long term emission rules need to be applied to all facilities - no loopholes, nor selective picking of which facilities they will apply to.  Rules and standards need to apply to all emissions being generated by all facilities - no loopholes or ""opt-outs"" should be allowed. Meeting healthy air standards should not be optional for any facilities. Its clear that the DEQ has not been adequately protecting public health as it relates to the levels of toxic air emissions - its time that changes.

Edward,Kent,kodiakbear80@gmail.com,,OR,"I have been following the news and debate about air pollution in Portland since this story broke in early February. I am an advocate for pollution control and holding businesses (as well as individuals and officials) responsible for actions that affect public health and well-being. However, I do not think these proposed temporary rules serve the purpose of protecting the public. 

The businesses in question have voluntarily stopped using the toxic metals (cadmium and arsenic) until they can install additional filtration. They also use trivalent chromium which is non-toxic, not hexavalent chromium.  

I have read the proposed rule. It is self-contradictory. ""The consequences of the EQC not taking immediate action to adopt the proposed rules would be that
emissions from colored art glass manufacturers could continue to cause elevated and possibly unsafe
levels of metals in the Portland area.""

""Could"" and ""possibly"" do not indicate the kind of imminent harm this kind of rule is intended to address. The two glass factories have been operating for forty years, and cadmium stays in the body for 28 years. If harm was being caused, we would already be seeing evidence. We are not, and the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Multnomah County Health Department have stated that there is no immediate health risk to the community.

This proposed rule is not intended to prevent harm. It's intended to absorb political heat. That's not a good reason to ruin our local businesses. Businesses that contribute to the art scene that makes Portland unique. Please do not implement this proposed rule.",

Even these temporary rules should address similar pollution from any source, not just glass manufacturing, and consequences for non-compliance should include substantial fines. Also, a non-response to an application should be counted as a denial, not a tacit acceptance for which no one need claim responsibility.

The DEQ's job is ""to protect the quality of Oregon's environment."" Citizens' health and environmental impacts are the top priorities, not profits â€” or even jobs!

* Are glassmakers getting the summer off, since no permits would be required until Sept 2016? The requirement should be effective immediately, with a 30-day or similar grace period.
* There should be a provision for similar emitters no matter what product they are producing. No loopholes.
* The DEQ may be willing to fix one of their mistakes from 2007 loopholes for Bullseye, but if they cannot do so with a transparent process that centers on the communities most at risk and provide them with a seat at the table that allows them to protect their own health, then no one can honestly say that their culture has changed.

Ted,Whitney,tr_whitney@yahoo.com,,Oregon,"I am a resident of Portland and a glass artist who has been a customer of Bullseye Glass for the last 10 years.  I am concerned with the poor state of Portland's air quality and I agree with the DEQ that immediate action must be taken to minimize the health impacts of emissions from art glass factories.  I stand with the Eastside Portland Air Coalition and I agree with their criticisms of the proposed DEQ temporary rules.  Having read the DEQ temporary rules document, I have the following comments and criticisms:
1) The DEQ rules are too narrow, in that they only address emissions from art glass factories in Portland.  Rules should be applied to all factories that emit toxic heavy metals throughout the entire state of Oregon.  At the very least, all glass factories in the state of Oregon should be subject to these rules.  These rules also narrowly address emissions of three toxic metals (cadmium, arsenic, chromium(VI)), while failing to provide protection from another metal that was detected in high levels: nickel.  The use of nickel should not be allowed in uncontrolled furnaces.
2) There are no penalties for businesses that violate the rules.  The temporary rules should include strict penalties for non-compliance, including ""cease and desist"" shutdown orders for factories that violate the rules and standards multiple times.
3) There should be clear and understandable standards that define unsafe levels of toxic metals and other hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).  These standards should be conservatively determined by the best available studies and knowledge of the potential for emissions to harm human health.  To determine standards, DEQ should rely on information from a wide range of sources, including the US EPA, CDC, OSHA, and OHA, as well as the latest environmental research studies.  ""Conservative"" to me means practicing the Precautionary Principal: If an action has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus, the burden of proof falls on those taking the action.  In other words, public health should come first and, if there is any doubt about the harmfulness of a given HAP, it should not be allowed into the air where it can cause harm.
4) I would like to specifically address the use of chromium(III) and its potential to be converted into the dangerous chromium(VI).  There have been arguments made by representatives of Bullseye Glass that their use of chromium(III) should not be restricted to controlled (filtered or bagged) furnaces.  These arguments are based on the findings of Professor William C. LaCourse of Alfred University.  His argument is that chromium(III), when used effectively and properly in glass furnaces, is melted in reductive conditions, thus minimizing the probability that chromium(III) will convert to chromium(VI).  Conversion of chromium(III) to (VI) requires an oxidizing environment, which (he argues) does not happen if the furnace is operated properly.  My argument is that this ignores what might be happening in the exhaust flue.  The glass furnace is not a closed system, so some chromium(III) will be released into the exhaust flue.  Inside this flue, especially near the top, chromium(III) can combine with oxygen under conditions which are still relatively hot and the result is that chromium(VI) will be released into the atmosphere outside the glass factory.  There is at least one study documenting the conversion of chromium(III) to chromium(VI) at temperatures as low as 200C to 300C, temperatures that are very possible inside the exhaust flue of a furnace operating at 1300C (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297546).  Professor LaCourse's own words are a reason for caution:  ""Note, that is does not mean that NO Cr+6 could be emitted from a stack...I cannot rule out the possibility that some of the Cr+3 entering the stack could be oxidized to Cr+6. ""    I urge the DEQ to require the use of controlled furnaces whenever chromium is combined with glass.  Chromium(III) and chromium(VI) should NEVER be used in an uncontrolled furnace.
Thank you for considering my comments.
Respectfully yours,
Ted Whitney",

For quite some time now, in Oregon and elsewhere, lax or insufficient regulation and monitoring have favored industry. It is time to shift the balance and implement a truly health-based permitting and regulatory system. I work in the health-care field and in order to maintain my state (OR) licensure I am required to stay current with advances and best practices in my field and am ethically obliged to ""do no harm"" because vulnerable human bodies are entrusted to my care. I believe that industries handling toxic materials that are potentially harmful to human health are similarly obliged to an equally rigorous level of care, caution, best practice and oversight. I would like to see that ethical obligation reflected and supported by the law. If smaller industries need financial help with compliance under stronger regulations, our legislators might consider offering tax credits or state/federally-managed low-interest loans. I am confident there are many creative, appropriate solutions to any financial burden stricter regulations might bring about.  I am a 35-yr resident of SE Portland living .38 miles from Bullseye Glass Co.

Sheryl,Maloney,sheryl.maloney@gmail.com,Resident,OR,"Dear EQC Commissioners, 

Thank you for allowing public comment both at the last ECQ meetings as well as during this public comment period. As you know this has been a painful process for both residents and the glass manufacturers. Although I truly sympathize with the concern that the manufacturers and the global glass artists have about losing jobs and potentially an art form, I am unable to put their needs above the health of my family and neighbors. 

The Oregon DEQ is supposed to be steward of the environment, and our first line of defense against these types of toxic situations. Sadly, the Oregon DEQ has been failing to protect our environment and thus the people living and working in it and it is time for real change. 

I wonâ€™t rehash all the issues and failures of how the last few months have played out, or focus here on the minutia of the temporary rules, as these items have been outlined in detail in the official EPAC statement and the statements of many other who are in favor of regulation. However, I will urge each of you to remember the original mission statement of the Oregon DEQ as you read through hundreds of comments submitted from those who do not live in our great state.  

DEQ's mission is to be a leader in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon's air, land and water. 
  
DEQ works collaboratively with Oregonians for a healthy, sustainable environment. 

Please remember that this issue is first and foremost about Oregon and Oregonians and take great care not to be swayed by those who do not live here, have to breath our air and who are so quick to dismiss our very real concerns for our families and homes as hysteria. 

	
Despite emotion and concern for my family, I feel that proper data, science and extreme due diligence should now be followed before permanent decisions are made about who, how or what is regulated. The devil is in the accuracy of the details and thus far, as is the case with the improper regulation and handling of metals in glass manufacturing, the DEQ and OHA have yet to demonstrate proper care and respect for the data they are charged with on behalf of the publicâ€™s health and safety. 

So, I ask you to carefully review and scrutinize every detail of this temporary rule so that you may find the best possible outcome that protects the environment, the health of the people and paves the way for sustainable industry practices. This is a watershed moment that has the potential to be a catalyst for truly cleaning up the air for Oregon and setting the tone for responsible regulations moving forward. Don't let this opportunity pass. 

In that spirit, I also urge you to consider other industries in all of Oregon that may be using heavy metals and toxics in during both your short and long-term rule-making process. There are so many sources that contribute to our dirty air and simply putting a cap on Bullseyeâ€™s operation is not a long-term or comprehensive solution that our community will stand by. 

Our children are the best resource to be â€œMade in Oregonâ€&#65533; and many, including my own, attend schools that are ranked in the bottom two percent in the nation for air quality. The time is now to improve our air rankings as a community, city and state before our childrenâ€™s quality of health suffers beyond repair. 

Thank You, 
Sheryl Maloney

I also teach in several workshops by using their glass. 

With the well-being of so many people at risk due to Bullseye's current severely reduced production, I am requesting that DEQ bring all capability to bear to help expedite whatever solution is determined best for all parties.
Expediency is perhaps the one non-controversial action by DEQ that will benefit both Bullseye and Portland residents while helping to rebuild credibility for DEQ.

Sebastian,McGaw,,Local Resident,Oregon,"Having read through many of the comments below, I have a grave concern that the proposed rules are not ready for enactment. Key among my points of concern: I am given to understand that the rules are based upon the tons of glass produced, rather than the quantities of materials used.  If our concern is about exposure to dangerous elements, such as arsenic and chromium, then the rules should focus on the amount of materials used that actually produce the toxic waste.  The rules should directly regulate the quantities of elements used by the manufacturer, e.g., how many pounds or tons of arsenic (or whatever compound is used that contains the arsenic).  Further, it appears that the rules would only affect the Portland area, and not the whole state.  This seems to me to be of great concern.  Air is not restricted by regional boundaries.  The rules should be statewide.  Finally, it seems that the rules do not apply to all sizes of manufacturer equally.  This also seems to be an area that needs attention in the rules.. Please do not rush into regulation; it is clear to me that more time is needed, both for development of the rule set, as well as time for the public to digest and consider the outcome of the rules development.  In the interim, all use of elements of concern should simply stop, until we know what the dangers truly are, and until we have put a set of rules in place that will effectively regulate the production of these hazards.

Bullseye understands the public health concern and has already agreed to address the issues of protection WITHOUT being shut down, and is already in the process of installing baghouses on their furnaces.  A temporary shutdown could easily lead to a permanent shutdown, not only for Bullseye, but for all of us who depend on Bullseyeâ€™s glass and glass products.
   I am a glass artist, sculptor and glass teacher in Richardson (Dallas) Texas and depend almost exclusively on Bullseyeâ€™s glass and glass products (and some Uroboros glass) both to create my artwork and to sell to my fused glass students for their work.  Glass is already an expensive product, and red colors are already unavailable.  The costs of these environmental protection devices will of necessity be passed on to Bullseyeâ€™s consumers.  DEQâ€™s forced shutdown would lead to even higher costs and unavailability of products, if their business is even able to survive the shutdown.  If Bullseye shuts down, I also will be out of business, as I will not be able to create work to sell.  Nor will I have glass for my students, and my teaching studio will close.  The DEQâ€™s hand is far-reaching and potentially devastating.
   I would not like to live near a manufacturer which produces toxic wastes, and I do have concerns for Portlandâ€™s residents.

Bullseye understands the public interest and supports stronger environmental standards for our industry. To that effect, the company has already begun the process of installing 99% efficient baghouses on furnaces that melt glasses with chromium. Bullseye Glass and DEQ will test these filtration devices to make certain they operate correctly.""

If we are not allowed to use Cr (III), we can no longer make green glass. On top of our voluntary suspension of cadmium glass production until our baghouse is in place, this new limitation would eliminate 50% of our product line.

Dear EQC Commissioners, 

Thank you for allowing public comment both at the last ECQ meeting as well as during this public comment period.  As you know this has been a painful process for both residents and the glass manufacturers. Although I truly sympathize with the concern the manufacturers and the global glass artists have about losing jobs and potentially an art form, I am unable to put their needs above the health of my family and neighbors. 

The Oregon DEQ is supposed to be the steward of the environment, and our first line of defense against these types of toxic situations. Sadly, the Oregon DEQ has been failing to protect our environment and thus the people living and working in it.  

I wonâ€™t rehash all the issues and failures of how the last few months have played out, or focus here on the minutia of the temporary rules, as these items have been outlined in detail in the official EPAC statement and the statements of many others who are in favor of regulation. However, I will urge each of you to remember the original mission statement of the Oregon DEQ as you read through hundreds of comments submitted from those who do not live in our great state.  

DEQ's mission is to be a leader in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon's air, land and water. 
  
DEQ works collaboratively with Oregonians for a healthy, sustainable environment. 

Please remember that this issue is first and foremost about Oregon and Oregonians and take great care not to be swayed by those who do not live here, have to breath our air, are vehemently against any regulation and who are so quick to dismiss our very real concerns for our families and homes as hysteria. 

Despite emotion and concern for my family, I feel that proper data, science and extreme due diligence should now be followed before permanent decisions are made about who, how or what to regulate. The devil is in the accuracy of the details and thus far, as is the case with the improper regulation and handling of metals in glass manufacturing, the DEQ and OHA have yet to demonstrate proper care and respect for the environmental data they are charged with on behalf of the publicâ€™s health and safety. 

So, I ask you to carefully review and scrutinize every detail of the temporary rule so that you may find the best possible outcome that protects the environment, the health of the people and paves the way for sustainable industry practices. This is a watershed moment that has the potential to be a catalyst for truly cleaning up the air for Oregon and setting the tone for responsible regulations moving forward. 

In that spirit, I also urge you to consider other industries in all of Oregon that may be using heavy metals and toxics in your rule-making process. There are so many sources that contribute to our dirty air and simply putting a cap on Bullseyes operation is not a long-term or comprehensive solution that our community will stand by. 

Our children are the best natural resource to be ""Made in Oregon"", they are invaluable and their health and safety cannot be equated to glass colors or any industrialized product. Many Portland children, including my own, attend schools that are ranked in the bottom two percent in the nation for air quality. The time is now to protect our resources and to improve our air rankings as a community, city and state before our childrenâ€™s quality of health suffers beyond repair.

As I said in my verbal comments at the EQC meeting on March 15, 2015, this temporary rule seems rushed.

The rule as written is not based on good science.  

At the public review I asked the EQC to please, please do their homework.  This temporary rule may not solve the health problem and by reducing their product line by ~50% might possibly put Bullseye into a financial position where there is no business remaining to rule.  Rushing, not actually solving the problem and destroying a small business in the process would not be a good result. 

While being in compliance with the existing rules and permits Bullseye did and continues to do the right thing.  They halted production using the chemicals in question.  They started work on a baghouse pilot that will allow for testing of emission control.  Once proven they will expand past the pilot.

I urge the DEQ and other involved agencies continue to work WITH Bullseye on this filtration pilot and expedite the permitting and other requirements.  (Expedite, not rush, going forward everything must still be precise and based on good science)

In fact, recent studies by the  Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Multnomah County Health Department have clearly stated that there is no immediate health risk to the community.

Minna,Shirley,minnaming@gmail.com,Bullseye Glass Company,Oregon,"I have been an employee of Bullseye Glass for almost ten years. Many of my colleagues have worked in the neighborhood for at least as long, if not for decades more. The issue of air toxics in Portland is not a new one, but recent news has turned this newest reminder of our not-so-green city into a false dichotomy of Us vs. Them. We are all breathing the same air, we are all working to understand the information being meted out by authorities that we thought were looking out for us.

At first the information was alarming and grim - like being told not to eat from our home gardens - and as we split into our ""us"" and ""them"" sides to mobilize and try to deal with the repercussions of that new knowledge, we lost the opportunity to work together. Worse than that - subsequent information (follow up soil and air testing) got lost in the noise, pushed to the side and/or filtered through our new ""us"" vs. ""them"" lenses.

Ultimately, the DEQ, in conjunction with the OHA, has made a confusing decision to on the one hand announce no acute nor discernible long term health effects from the emissions perceived in our neighborhood; but on the other hand are pushing through a hastily assembled temporary rule that all but guarantees to hamstring one specific type of industry - ignoring all other contributing factors to our airshed. 

I urge the EQC to consider the facts. I know that Bullseye is committed to installing filtration and honoring its suspension of cadmium use until said filtration is in place and has been proven to be effective.

The proposed temporary rule is mostly a shadow of what is already being done, with the added chromium III restriction. This restriction will do very little to improve my neighborhood's air, but it will severely impact Bullseye's ability to move forward with its plans for filtration.

Let's work toward permanent regulations that consider not only the science of what is in our air, but also the scale of all the contributing factors.

I know one person personally (and two others through her who live within blocks of each other and live inside the toxic Bullseye hotspot). All three of them have pre menopausal breast cancer. This is horrifying, immoral and tragic. 

Though I have no documented chronic health issues, I know, and know of, many people in this neighborhood who do. We may not be able to prove that the unregulated emissions of Bullseye glass or Precision Cast Parts, et.al. were the cause of these illnesses, but suffice it to say that at the very least, these toxic emissions likely exacerbated the severity of them. 

Shame on all of the regulators, legislators and business people who looked the other way to straight up create regulatory loopholes to allow the emission of Lead, Fluoride, Arsenic, Nickel, Cadmium and Chromium III and Chromium VI (and who knows what else). 

Until the operations at these facilities can be regulated to protect public health and safety, be continually monitored and be completely transparent with the public, there should be NO operations. 

Until the emissions of all these operations can be filtered through an appropriate bag house, no stack should be emitting anything. 

If that cannot be done with our current means and technologies, then we should stop the industrial processes that produce toxic heavy metal emissions.  I can live with out colored glass, but I cannot live without my lungs.

All furnaces employed in the manufacture of colored art glass should be outfitted with state of the art baghouse filtration systems before the art glass companies are permitted to continue to manufacture using dangerous materials recognized to be harmful to human health.  This expectation that city residents be protected from exposure to these incredibly high levels of carcinogenic heavy metals should not be in dispute.  Up to now the safety of the public has come second to the industries that have been allowed to put them at risk.  This is a shameful disrespect to the well being of the people of Portland.  Benchmark levels adopted to regulate toxic emissions should be the lowest standards of any State rather than an average or an arbitrary level.  The Multnomah river valley is prone to atmospheric inversions that trap air pollution which is why the need for lower benchmark standards than in other communities.  Clearly outlined and strictly imposed penalties need to be written into the temporary rules in order to enforce the benchmark standards.  ",

DEQ has an opportunity to create a positive public relations story for itself now.  By supporting Bullseyeâ€™s emissions controls upgrade, the environment will improve and DEQ is shown as leading the way.  However, the temporary rule being considered by DEQ could cripple Bullseye causing layoffs, or worse.  If Bullseye goes out of business DEQ will be seen as improving the environment by killing a local, homegrown business that directly employs 150 people and indirectly many more---including my job.
 
Bullseye has a good track record regarding health and safety regulations.  During my 26 year relationship with Bullseye, they have improved their safety practices as environmental regulations evolved.
 
Most importantly, I believe Bullseye Glass Co. has a company culture of doing what is right.  Any implication that they have knowingly poisoned the environment is inconsistent with my knowledge of the owners and their employees.
 
In recent weeks Bullseye has demonstrated a strong willingness to upgrade their manufacturing processes with newer pollution control technology to improve their air quality discharges and meet DEQâ€™s requirements.  They should be allowed to do this. Any DEQ actions that could result in layoffs at Bullseye due to loss of business are misguided.

Mary Kay,Nitchie,nitchwick@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I believe Bullseye is doing the right thing for neighbors, and EQC, DEQ and the Office of the Governor should support Bullseyeâ€™s efforts by moving forward with an agreement, not with temporary rules. There is no imminent health and safety danger, and therefore, the conditions for temporary rules have not been met. 

Since early February 2016, the reputation of Bullseye Glass Co. was severely damaged by the careless and unsubstantiated communications from DEQ, OHA and MCHD. The DEQ leaked air monitoring data with no associated testing protocol and insufficient context, and said that Bullseye was the source, without adequate explanation. The OHA stated that health benchmarks were exceeded, without explaining to all of us what health benchmarks mean. The MCHD warned people not to eat from their gardens, raising fears that later, after soil testing, turned out to be completely without foundation, and at the same time, implicated Bullseye without acknowledgement of other industries that currently and historically have contributed to pollution. Near Bullseye, these include metal recycling, plating, cement, diesel trucks and buses, the rail yards, and Tri-Metâ€™s Orange Line construction, and residential wood-burning fireplaces, among others. 

In my personal view, Bullseye is not fighting the neighbors. Bullseye is fighting to improve and survive while being hobbled from making half its product line, while investing in expensive filtration equipment. Not many small businesses could survive under those conditions. The enforcement of temporary rules would hobble Bullseye even further, which is totally unfair, because the same scrutiny and demands have not been applied to any other Portland businesses. Bullseye has demonstrated great motivation and progress toward adding filtration systems in the last 60 days, and the adoption of temporary rules will slow that down, if it doesnâ€™t cause the business to fail. If Bullseye fails, that will have a domino effect on many other businesses, statewide, nationwide, and worldwide.  

My confidence will not be restored in the Office of the Governor, the EQC, or in DEQ until DEQ starts working in good faith with Bullseye and with our neighbors. An agreement that can be adapted in response to new testing data will be more effective than the adoption of flawed temporary rules. 

I have worked at Bullseye Glass Co. for over 25 years, breathing the same air as our closest neighbors.  My comments are my personal opinions, and Bullseye Glass may or may not agree with me. ",
scott,fernandez,sltucino@gmail.com,Eastside Portland Air Coalition,Oregon,"To: Oregon DEQ - comments regarding Portlandâ€™s air
 From: Scott Fernandez M.Sc. Biology  chemistry/microbiology
      
Oregon has the third largest population at risk of excess cancer due to air pollution behind only California & New York. (USEPA National Air Toxics Assessment). 117 Oregon schools fall into the worst 10% nationally for exposure to industrial pollution. (USEPA).
Diesel particulate matter (from trucks, construction equipment and rail yards) is responsible for approximately 460 premature deaths a year in Oregon. Thatâ€™s more than those who die from homicide and drunk driving, (USEPA) (Neighbors for Clean Air).
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and city officials have known about these toxic and carcinogenic chemicals for over a decade.
It was testified at the Tubman School Town Hall that little had been done by officials to address the issue. State environmental regulators have been criticized since public disclosure of results February 3, eight months after learning about the heavy metal discoveries such as arsenic, then chromium, lead, and nickel in addition to cadmium.
Public health and well-being have been placed at high risk while state and city officials have done little to address these issues.
The most important policies not aggressively pursued by the state were the advancement of stronger air quality regulations. This would have allowed reducing, and eventually eliminating toxic chemicals through permitting and tightening filtration engineering improvements.
The EPA has recognized the â€œone size fits allâ€&#65533; approach is outdated. In 2012 a Federal Register notice to California EPA provided a waiver as part of their State Implementation Plan (SIP) allowing stronger air quality standards; providing cleaner air by moving away from the one size fits all.
Revision of the Oregon State Implementation Plan and help from elected officials can move us into a direction of obtaining a waiver allowing tighter air quality regulations.
For this to happen, elected officials must hear community voices speaking up for healthy air quality.
City of Portland (Comprehensive Plan Update August 2015) and State of Oregon use â€œambient benchmark concentrationâ€&#65533; as their â€œone size fits allâ€&#65533; standard.
All ages of community members comingled together does not adequately provide meaningful individual specific risk assessments. The EPA Safe Drinking Water Act clearly and distinctly acknowledges differences between children and adults.
The state and the city ought to dismiss this â€œone size fits allâ€&#65533; approach. Children are not smaller versions of adults. Children have developing immune, nerve, and bone systems much different than adults. Chemicals such as cadmium, lead, etc. can cross the placenta negatively impacting fetal development milestone processes. Chemicals can also be found in breast milk.
The chemicals chromium, cadmium and lead have been identified as metalloestrogens. These toxic and carcinogenic chemicals interfere with estrogen pathways and can be associated with breast cancer, etc.
The City of Portland and state officials need to stop industrial exposures of the heavy metals, fluorine, Volatile Organic Compounds, petroleum emissions, and other harmful air contaminants.
Residents have had enough of toxic and carcinogenic heavy metal chemical exposures, inadequate air filtration, information withheld from community, along with the uncertainty and deep concern for childrenâ€™s health in the City of Portland and the State of Oregon.

I stand with Bullseye Glass in its efforts to continue operations as a responsible citizen of the social and business community of Portland, Oregon and urge you to get all the scientific facts and understand the impact these regulations would have. DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533; In face, DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;
 
Regulatory decisions must be based on science, not political issues. A leading scientist, Dr. William LaCourse of Alfred University, has said Bullseyeâ€™s furnaces do not produce toxic chromium. I urge DEQ to rely on science and fact, and not to rush to impose these poorly written and misdirected rules that could destroy an industry with a cascading effect across the country and around the globe.

The people who work work at Bullseye have been so helpful in helping me become a glass artist.  I have been coming to Bullseye glass since 1995 with my father who believed in their glass and encouraged me to use their great quality glass
I strongly feel the temporary rule making regarding their use of Cr lll is not fair.
I am glad Bullseye is installing filter/scrubbers on the furnaces that produce the glass colors which use Cr lll.
Your rules are hastily adopted and do NOT take in to consideration the science.  This is not Cr V being produced.
In addition, the neighborhood that Bullseye has been in for more than 20 years has a long history of manufacturing....not residences.
I suspect these heavy metals could have come from other sources.
Please do NOT let Oregon, Portland and me loose this unique resource!

Rhoda,Baer,rhoda@rhodabaer.com,glass artist,Maryland,"There are many issues to consider. Please let DEQ and the Environmental Quality Commission know whether you agree with the points below, and let them know how you would be affected by the temporary or permanent loss of Bullseyeâ€™s products.

    This is an improper use of temporary rule making. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should only consider a temporary rule when credible evidence demonstrates a rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

    Hastily adopting temporary rules make it appear that agencies are being proactive, but these rules do not protect the public, and makes Bullseye a scapegoat. There is no evidence that emissions from the facility pose any acute health risk nor that Bullseye is fully responsible for the emissions, nor that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

    If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public.

    There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found that there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributed to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As the OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533;[1] OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533;[2]

    Further, DEQ found no health concerns due to cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;[3]

    DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;
     
    Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, DEQ should focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. Bullseye will support that effort. These rules should give clear directions to businesses and support the safety of the community. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.

    With minor changes to correct scientific errors and omissions in the currently proposed rule, Bullseye Glass is willing to sign an agreement that achieves all of DEQâ€™s goals and allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

    The haste to adopt technically flawed temporary rules makes it appear that Oregon is repressive to manufacturing businesses and does not care about jobs.

    Oregon agencies should strive for proper and fair treatment of all parties, based on law, rather than responding to public concern resulting from sensational blog posts and test results with partial data and no peer review.

    The health and safety of the community can be achieved without forcing these businesses to close.

    If Bullseye Glass is forced to stop producing 50% of its glass products for 6 months, without regard to ongoing test results or added emission controls, Bullseyeâ€™s survival is at risk. We support an agreement that is similar to the temporary rules, but unlike the temporary rules, also allows DEQ and Bullseye to respond promptly to new factual information.

    Bullseye Glass Co. has a payroll of $7.5 million dollars. 130 Portland families and 20 other Bullseye families depend on Bullseye for jobs. Hundreds of Oregon artists and craftspeople depend upon Bullseye products. Tens of thousands of artists across the United States and the world depend upon Bullseye products.

Arlene,Williams,awilliams222@outlook.com,resident of polluted zone ,Or,"As a resident of a polluted zone near Precision Castparts in SE Portland, I am concerned about the proposed rule. The rule proposal seems to be inadequate in addressing the true emergency and risk to public health, as it:

will allow unexplainably for the emission of chromium 6 at levels 20 times less protective than Oregon's established ambient benchmark;
will allow DEQ to unilaterally make decisions that affect human health, including for production to recommence, without adequate public involvement;
will not sufficiently safeguard against ongoing racial injustice and environmental justice disparities caused by toxic air pollution, by too narrowly limiting which facilities will be subject to this rule. ",
Susan,Shea,sue@stainedglassresources.com,"Stained Glass Resources, Inc.",Massachusetts,"Stained Glass Resources, Inc. is quite concerned with the steps taken by the DEQ with regards to Bullseye and Uroboros glass manufacturers. We fully agree with the Stained Glass Association of Americaâ€™s response. 

â€œThe Stained Glass Association of America (SGAA) fully supports improved emission control systems, corporate responsibility, and a clean environment. We care about the effects that manufacturing can produce, but we also place high emphasis on scientific fact. The temporary rules that are being imposed on the glass manufacturing companies, Bullseye and Uroboros, are not being investigated fairly through scientific testing. Our organization fears that hastily written regulations will have a harmful ripple effect across this nation, causing irreparable harm to the stained glass industry by taking away the very materials used in our craft.â€&#65533;

â€œRegulatory decisions must be based on science, not political issues. A leading scientist, Dr. William LaCourse of Alfred University, has said Bullseyeâ€™s furnaces do not burn hot enough to produce toxic chromium. If it did, it would ruin the glass being produced. We urge DEQ to rely on science and fact and not to rush to impose these poorly written and misdirected rules.â€&#65533;

â€œThe SGAA asks that the DEQ continue to work with these companies under the current regulations and agreements until all of the testing is completed and the results are understood. Only then should the DEQ issue regulations that address and solve the specific problems. Again we ask that the DEQâ€™s temporary agreement be flexible enough to change based on new factual information that will emerge. As these companies work to fix the emission problem, we ask that the DEQ remove limits and restrictions imposed on them. We speak on behalf of hundreds of our members who will be negatively affected by these regulations. Because of the limitations of these two glass-manufacturing companies, the DEQ is creating waves of upheaval and uncertainty for an entire art form and industry.â€&#65533;

Cara,Humphries,c_humphries@sbcglobal.net,Cara Humphries Studio,Missouri,"My name is Cara Humphries and I am a small art glass studio owner in Kansas City. I employee 3 people including myself.
I am concerned that my industry and 1st amendment rights are about to take a huge and unnecessary blow due in large part to our election year fear mongering and hysteria.
So I'd like to remind us all of some big picture facts. 
American manufacturing and industry have been decimated over the last few decades. 
One area where we are still working is in the fine arts. Here, in Kansas City we have numerous examples of how the arts industry has revitalized blighted urban areas or have kept people employed as other industries have moved over seas.
Uroborus and Bullseye are both examples of the fine art industry providing employment opportunities. In fact they support industry all over the country. I rely heavily on their product in large part because it is made in America where I know there are environmental and employment standards in place. It is distressing to me to think I may have to purchase product from areas of the world where it has been documented that the powers that be do not care what they are doing to their citizens, much less the global community. 
Arts entrepreneurs here in Kansas City have always been progressive and responsive community leaders. Uroborous has shown similar responsiveness in voluntarily shutting down manufacturing to improve their emissions standards. This should be applauded and supported. Don't forget there is no documented scientific evidence supporting emissions concerns emanating from current manufacturing practices by these two companies. 
The only reason to shut down their manufacturing is to cave to election year irrationality.
There are other big issues at stake here, free expression and religion. The arts have always been afforded protection by the federal courts as they are recognized bastions of our first amendment right to free expression. 
Stained glass has the long and well documented history of being the preeminent form of the expression of religious and social themes. The proof of this is in almost every religious building on this country.
 In allowing fear to override fact you will be responsible for the erosion of free expression, free religion, and American industry. Is this the history you want written about Oregon?
I implore you to take a deep breath, look at the facts, and remember you are about to play a significant role in some big picture issues. Make it a positive one. 
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration,

Nancy,Merryman,nmerryman@merrymanbarnesarchitects.com,,Oregon,"I love living in a manufacturing town. I do not want to banish industry, nor do I think that would solve our pollution problems. However, our sciences and technologies are coming of age now. Our former ignorance regarding the health effects of toxic pollutants that allowed them to disperse or ""dilute"" into the ecosystem has become completely unsustainable. There is no longer any meaningful excuse, particularly when appropriate containment technologies exist, to allow any industry, large or small, to continue to risk the health of anyone, anywhere. For quite some time now, in Oregon and elsewhere, lax or insufficient regulation and monitoring have favored industry. It is time to shift the balance and implement a truly health-based permitting and regulatory system.

I would like to see that ethical obligation reflected and supported by the law. If smaller industries need financial help with compliance under stronger regulations, our legislators might consider offering tax credits or state/federally-managed low-interest loans. I am confident there are many creative, appropriate solutions to any financial burden stricter regulations might bring about.

OHA has been emphasizing  only Cancer Risks.  EPA looks at , and OHA also must look at,  considerable Non-Cancer risks of arsenic and cadmium exposure. Recent literature is exploring epidemiological evidence of significant risks from low dose exposures, according to a new paradigm that recognizes that early pre- natal and post natal effects of such exposures cause long term poor health outcomes other than cancer. I attach our two recent Fact Sheets on Health Effects of Arsenic and Cadmium to illustrate such new developments in scientific evidence about excess exposure to these two elements. New health based standards should take these into account . In the meantime, these interim rules should not minimize risks.

What is happening here appears to be a situation of ""mass hysteria"" concerning Portlands ""Toxic Air.""  I think DEQ made a significant mistake in releasing maps purportedly showing air concentrations of toxic pollutants based only on one sample period and the moss samples.  The science isn't there, and I explain that in this blog post that I put onto both Google+ and Facebook.  

I think you need to walk back that misinformation, and talk directly about the science, and how it would need many, many more samples in order to validate that the moss samples say anything about possible toxic exposures to people.  You also need to discuss what the word, ""toxic"" actually means, the relationship between toxicity and dose, and to say that so far, you have not documented toxic doses in people.  

Concerning the two glass manufacturers, you need also to tell the public that almost all their toxic components stay in the glass.  Very little goes up the stacks.  But because of this publicity, the use of better technology will reduce these components further.

I have been associated with Bullseye Glass since1998, becoming an Authorized Dealer in 2002.  My business success depends on Bullseye Glass.  Not only do I, as an artist use Bullseye glass, I am an instructor and teach with Bullseye glass.  C3 Studios is also is a 2200 square foot working artist studio that resells Bullseye glass.  I usually have a very large sale every April to celebrate our anniversary.  C3 could not offer the sale this year due to lack of a large number of colors our customers demand in the spring time (red, yellow, orange, etc.).  If you, as politicians and environmentalists respond in a knee jerk reaction and place even temporary restrictions on Bullseye and Uroboros glass manufacturers, you will be putting my company and livelihood in jeopardy, as well as many of our local artists.  Take some time to gather all the FACTS before implementing any restrictions. 

Portland Oregon is currently the focus of the entire worldâ€™s glass artists and other glass manufacturerâ€™s attention.  If my company, C3, is forced to close, I will no longer have any need to travel to Portland Oregon for the Bullseye Conferenceâ€™s, purchasing trips, or trips to take educational classes.  On a personal level, I recycle everything (home and studio), I compost in my yard at home, and I take the environment seriously.  It is my understanding that Bullseye and Uroboros Glass manufacturers have been more than complainant and willing to work with the local officials.  Slow down and know all the facts before you make decisions that will have a really large ripple affect around the world.

Please do not place the well meaning board members in the untenable position of enacting a rule that they don't yet fully understand the science behind and aren't capable of enacting due to the above mentioned concerns regarding staffing/budget issues.  Please do not enact rules that have decade long implications when there is no immediate need to do so.  The state toxicologist, health department and the cdc has not found cause for alarm.  This should reassure the DEQ that it has time to consider this decision.  I urge you to say no to the proposed regulations in order to avoid ""causing more harm than good"".  Bullseye Glass is a terrific and responsible company and a shining star in the world wide art and glass community.

Bryant,Stanton,bryant@stantonglass.com,Stanton Studios,Texas,"The Uroboros Glass and Bullseye Glass companies both have over 40 years of history in responsible operation. I stand with both companies in the efforts to continue operations as responsible citizens of the social and business community in Portland, Oregon. 

I fully support improved emission control systems, corporate responsibility, and a clean environment, but progress in these areas should be based on science and proven facts. Hastily written regulations will have a harmful ripple effect across this nation, causing irreparable harm to the stained glass industry by taking away materials used in our craft. Each sheet of glass produced at both of these facilities are, in fact, handcrafted one sheet at a time by experienced glass workers. The art glass being produced by these two companies is unique only to Portland and is not produced anywhere else in the world. To saddle these companies with knee jerk regulations based on myth and not science could shutter these businesses and disrupt the operations of thousands of businesses around the world.

Regulatory decisions must be based on science, not political issues. A leading scientist, Dr. William LaCourse of Alfred University, has said Bullseyeâ€™s furnaces do not produce toxic chromium. I urge DEQ to rely on science and fact and not to rush to impose these poorly written and misdirected rules. During my 35 years as a stained glass artist, I have enjoyed a partnership with both Uroboros and Bullseye, and almost all of my custom art glass designs incorporate sheet glass from one or both of these companies. I can truthfully say that any misdirected regulations against these highly-respected companies will impede production and prices for stained glass studios across America. It is my hope that fact and science will be heralded over false, political pretenses.

Bullseye Glass is the only art glass manufacturer provide right (fired compatible) colored glass for me to create my artworks. To make intricate, many colors fused together, multiple firing required fused art works like mine, artists need absolutely well made fusible glass. Bullseye Glass is the one. 
We all fusing artists are rely on the company. Because of the reason, for us, Portland is Mecca of Glass Fusing.

Judith,Conway,vitrum@vitrumstudio.com,"Vitrum Studio, Inc. ",Maryland,"I own Vitrum Studio in the Washington, DC area with a studio partner. We have been in operation for almost 20 years, and teach classes with Bullseye glass and products exclusively. We depend upon our studio for our income. Our financial survival is dependent on Bullseye's products.

Many of our customers are professional artists who use Bullseye's glass exclusively. Their livelihoods are also dependent upon Bullseye glass. There is no substitute, no other glass, that we or they can use.

The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission should consider the temporary rule only when credible evidence demonstrates the rule is needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533; This is not the case here.

There is no immediate health risk. The recent OHA studies found there was no increased cancer risk in SE Portland attributable to Bullseyeâ€™s use of these materials. As OHA states on its website, â€œit is unlikely that the level of metals detected in the air would cause any immediate health problems for people.â€&#65533; OHA also concluded that current data shows â€œlong-term health risks are relatively low.â€&#65533; 

Further, DEQ found no health concerns resulting from cadmium, arsenic, total chromium or hexavalent chromium in the soil around Bullseyeâ€™s factory. Soil samples showed soil levels were generally below naturally occurring or â€œbackgroundâ€&#65533; levels of heavy metals. Keith Johnson, manager for the DEQâ€™s Northwest Region Cleanup Program, stated, â€œ[o]ngoing emissions from the Bullseye facility are not resulting in harmful impacts to soils around the facility.â€&#65533;

These temporary rules do not protect the public and they place undue restrictions on Bullseye Glass. They also will cause extreme restrictions to those of us who depend upon Bullseyeâ€™s products for our livelihood. There has been no evidence that emissions from the factory pose any acute health risk, or that Bullseyeâ€™s 42 years of operation have resulted in areas of health concerns in the vicinity of the facility.

If the EQC were to implement this temporary rule, numerous significant sources of toxic air pollution will remain from many unregulated businesses. Thus, the temporary rule would not effectively protect the public. Furthermore, DEQâ€™s and OHAâ€™s own statements provide that the rule is not needed to prevent â€œserious prejudice to the public interest.â€&#65533;

Instead of a hasty and discriminatory temporary rule, I urge that DEQ focus on permanent rules, based on scientific investigation and a thoughtful process to address Portlandâ€™s air quality issues. New regulations should cover all businesses, not just target minor specific industries.
With the livelihoods and well-being of so many people at risk due to Bullseye's current severely reduced production, I am requesting that DEQ bring all capability to bear to help expedite whatever solution is determined best for all parties.

Tracy,Sawyer,travelintrace@hotmail.com,,Oregon,"As a SE Portland resident living near Bullseye Glass, I support EPAC's comments that have been submitted. 

The DEQ's mission statement says the DEQ is to protect our air, land and water. In order to achieve this mission, DEQ must base the regulations of glass manufacturers on standards that lead to zero emissions of toxins in our environment and not based on industry thresholds in their productions. In other words, DEQ should be setting limits based on health standards and not on what works within industryâ€™s manufacturing process.

Small manufacturers must filter all emissions just as larger manufacturers must. The same stringent guidelines should be put into place and enforced regardless of the size of the manufacturer.

The temporary rules should include the filtering of nickel. 

The temporary rules should start at once and not wait until Sept 1st, which allows industry to pollute our air for 5 more months. 

DEQ should require companies to test Every controlled and uncontrolled outlet stack to ensure that no toxic emissions are overlooked. 

It is important that steep enforceable fines are clearly noted in the temporary rules so that industry has a clear incentive to follow the new rules. 

True level of compliance must also be achieved by clandestine air monitoring, thorough toxicity testing through moss and soil sampling, plus blood/urine testing of those living nearby to get an accurate assessment of contamination and to ensure that our environment is properly cleaned up. A thorough assessment of contamination has not bee done and needs to occur immediately.

Emissions should be tested for Chromium VI as there seems to be no clarity on whether it is being created in emissions. 

Finally, these new regulations should include small and medium sized manufacturers in other industries as well to truly improve our air, land and water quality. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the temporary rules.

My family and I operate McMow Art Glass located in Lake Worth, FL. We are a family-owned and operated art glass studio celebrating our 40th anniversary this year (and we hope to continue that legacy for another 40). Throughout our duration Bullseye Glass has been the backbone of the art glass industry, our business, and livelihood.  In addition to our family, McMow employs 15 individuals, all with families of their own. 

We could not agree more that the publicâ€™s safety is always priority number one â€“ which is why we support Bullseye Glass Co. They have operated safely and under the guidelines necessary to manufacture glass for their community, employees and consumers of their products, as instructed by the regulatory entities in Portland. We have seen absolutely NO evidence to the contrary. 

Emotions aside, it should also be noted, perhaps more importantly, that Bullseye has been operating under the DEQs guidelines this entire time. They have not once stepped out of their boundaries on this, and even attempted to go above and beyond by halting their production of the glasses in question, even when no guidelines forced them to. If we allow these temporary regulations to go into effect, we will be punishing a business that provides to communities, not just in Portland, but all throughout America. 

We implore the DEQ to base its upcoming decision in regard to temporary regulations on actual, scientific fact, and not fear. The temporary regulations which you are considering would be crushing to our industry, as well as the entire community in Portland. 

Bullseye is a small business which has supported the Portland community in many ways. Not only have they done so through employment opportunities, but also by being at the epicenter of the artistic hub which has made Portland a destination for artists of all kinds from all over the world.  If you, as regulators, turn your back on the businesses who have worked to embrace Portland, the ripple effects will be felt for years to come. 

We hope that the DEQ will work WITH Bullseye, not against them, in order to create a solution. The economic impact of this type of sweeping, and discriminatory action should be seriously considered as the consequences to such an irresponsible precedent are yet to even be considered.  
 
Here at McMow we are already trying to cope with the lack of access to the material we so desperately need. Think about the people all over the country â€“ like us â€“ who will be horrifically impacted when they can no longer pay their employees, and provide for their families.

A couple of questions/ concerns: 1) Are glass factories allowed to emit air toxics prior to September 1st?  As a resident living close to one of the factories, I hope not.  Iâ€™m recovering from treatment for an aggressive form of cancer with a high rate of metastasis and my treatment contributed to a disabling neuropathy in feet.  Iâ€™m doing everything I can to heal from treatment and to keep metastasis at bay.  Continued exposure to known carcinogens and neurotoxins isnâ€™t part of my care plan. On behalf of all residents who are in a fragile state of health, please protect us from any further exposure to these substances. We donâ€™t have the luxury of waiting until September 1st.  2) I know that pollution control technology isnâ€™t cheap and that there will be some burden on smaller businesses.  But Iâ€™m curious how you determined the criteria of â€œ10 tons of colored glass.â€&#65533;  Could you put that in perspective for those of us not in the glass-making industry?  How many tons of glass is made by Bullseye and Uroboros, for example?  What other glass manufacturers produce that much glass? Are emissions that are created during processing 9 tons of glass considered negligible?  3) Why donâ€™t these rules apply statewide?  Even if the current concerns are specific to Portland, it seems important to include the entire state in the rules.  The same health impacts are a concern wherever a plant is located, particularly if people live nearby.  4) Please consider requiring filters for lead and all other potentially hazardous materials.

Joan,Findlay,jnphl@earthlink.net,,Oregon,"My husband and I have lived approximately 1 mile from the Bullseye Glass Company for 26 1/2 years.  I was pregnant in this house and our son who is 24 now has lived here his entire life.  

After I read the article in The Mercury, some red flags went off for me concerning health issues in our family.  I noticed that some of the toxic metals found to be emitted were known to cause skin cancer, kidney issues, lung issues and I already knew that heavy metals are implicated in neuro-developmental disorders.

My son is on the autism spectrum and at one point I noticed that we knew several boys within close proximity who were also affected.  My husband has had serious lung issues which were finally determined to be a cough variant asthma.  

Over the past ten years I have had many tumors and several surgeries due to these tumors, including a radical nephrectomy, radical hysterectomy, bone tumor excision, etc.   Some were unusual or unusually presenting tumors, and though all were determined to be benign, the kidney tumor had been bleeding and was in danger of hemorrhage, therefore life-threatening.  In addition, I have had skin cancers: a melanoma, 2 squamous cell carcinomas and a basal cell carcinoma.  My dermatologist dubbed me â€œthe queen of odd little thingsâ€&#65533; because I have had so many unusual growths.  None of my siblings have had similar health issues.

I have a friend who has lived in the neighborhood for many years.  He had a benign brain tumor a few years ago, a meningioma, that grew large enough to be symptomatic.  These are tumors that can go unnoticed as they usually remain quite small.  His brain surgeon remarked, at the time, that he wished he knew what was going on, as he had been seeing an extraordinary number of these tumors grow sizable enough to cause trouble.

I realize these are anecdotal accounts and that it is possible that there is no correlation to the air quality.  My question is whether these other health issues are being tracked or taken into consideration in regards to the safeguarding of the public from air pollutants.  I have been aware, for instance, that autism and melanoma rates have been inexplicably high in Oregon and considering the main population base is Portland, I wonder if the poor air quality could be a factor in these high statistics.  I heard that decisions were being made after some preliminary looks at cancer rates (though not skin cancers) in very close proximity (a half mile) to the glass factories.  My concern is that those who live further from the factories should also be considered, and that the effects of very long term exposure should be taken into account.  I wonder whether the rates of not just cancer, but other health issues of the entire city are being compared to other comparably sized cities.           

I know that Portland and Oregon have serious issues with diesel fumes and other industrial emissions, as well as those from the glass factories.  My hope is that after the many decades of poor air quality we have suffered, that we will be able to live up to our green reputation by enforcing some very strict new regulations.

Adopting temporary rules that will shut down Bullseye will do nothing more than seriously affect not only them but the thousands of artists like myself who depend on their product to remain in business.,
Susan,Pearce,char@handpdx.org,Hosford Abernethy Neighborhood Association,Oregon,"Dear Commissioners Oâ€™Keeffe, Armstrong, Rider, Johnson, and Eden,

The Hosford Abernethy Neighborhood Association (HAND) represents the area just north of Bullseye Glass in Portland, including one of the larger residential areas impacted by toxic air emissions from the Bullseye facility.  Our neighborhood also includes part of the Central Eastside Industrial District, so we understand the challenge balancing the needs of those governed by DEQ's proposed temporary rules with the health and safety of those living and working nearby.

First, we'd like to thank you for creating the opportunity for public comment on the proposed temporary rules governing air toxics in the Portland area.  We believe the proposed temporary rules are a good start, but we would like to see them strengthened in the following ways:

1. The proposed rules should apply to all small industries, not just manufacturers of art glass â€“ We feel that any industry emitting toxic materials should be regulated by these temporary rules.  Metals such as cadmium and arsenic are equally damaging to health if they are emitted from a glass maker or from a metal plating shop.  The Forest Service's moss data tells us there are many more uncontrolled emission sources than there are glass factories, and we feel all should be covered by the emergency rules.

2. The temporary rules should include both filtration and monitoring â€“ In addition to installing state-of-the-art emission control equipment, we feel there is a need to continuously monitor what is being emitted into the air by these facilities.  The cost of monitoring should be considered just another cost of using hazardous materials in an urban setting.

3. The threshold for being covered by these rules should be lowered â€“ The proposed rules only cover facilities using more than 10 tons of raw materials per year, not including recycled glass or cullet.  We feel this threshold is far too high, and that the minimum-size facility these rules would apply to should be much smaller.  It is unlikely that a hobby glass maker would process even a single ton of material in a year.  We also feel that recycled cullet should be considered a raw material for the purposes of this rule, to avoid creating an artificially distinction between facilities using recycled glass and those starting from raw materials.

4. All furnaces in facilities processing hazardous materials should be controlled â€“ The proposed rules cover only a small subset of materials of concern, and if a facility has both controlled and uncontrolled furnaces, the potential exists for an operator to, intentionally or not, melt toxic materials in an uncontrolled furnace.  Filtering all furnaces would eliminate that possibility.

5. Unmade decisions should default to â€œNoâ€&#65533; â€“ When DEQ receives a notice of intent to construct/modify/change an emission control system, the proposed rules state that by doing nothing, the application will be deemed approved.  Instead, if no decision is rendered, the application should be deemed denied.  Approval should require affirmative action by DEQ.

6. Penalties for evading these regulations should be made more severe â€“ Intentionally evading these or other environmental rules should carry a more severe penalty, and should include a private right to action to allow those harmed by such evasion to allow enforcement when DEQ does not act.

Guy,Maguire,guy.maguire.m@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I appreciate the work being done to address the recent revelations about our dirty air in Portland. However, I am concerned because these companies have been allowed to pollute under DEQ regulations for many years, and I fear the proposed temporary DEQ changes will not adequately address the depth of the problem. I urge our government to consider supporting the creation of a local air quality management institution, like has been successful in other areas in Oregon.

As a resident who lives near PCC in SE Portland, I am deeply concerned about the heavy metals myself and my family are exposed to daily. I understand these companies have ample resources to afford pollution control devices. We need to be asking them to be good neighbors and take steps to curb pollution. The people affected by pollution should not be the ones responsible for footing the bill. That should be the responsibility of the corporations who pollute, and should be considered a cost of doing business. 

I believe the creation of a local agency to monitor the air and advocate for the people will be a necessary step in this process. Thank you for your attention to this important issue. ",

Gail,Sherman,gsherman@reed.edu,,OR,"I want to add my voice to a comment made by Katharine Salzmann, who expresses my thoughts succinctly: """"Our sciences and technologies are coming of age now. Our former ignorance regarding the health effects of toxic pollutants that allowed them to disperse or ""dilute"" into the ecosystem has become completely unsustainable. There is no longer any meaningful excuse, particularly when appropriate containment technologies exist, to allow any industry, large or small, to continue to risk the health of anyone, anywhere. For quite some time now, in Oregon and elsewhere, lax or insufficient regulation and monitoring have favored industry. It is time to shift the balance and implement a truly health-based permitting and regulatory system. ""

I am a 35 year resident of Portland, working on the East Side, and I stand with Eastside Portland Air Coalition, Neighbors for Clean Air and the revisions to the proposed temporary rules submitted by Chris Winter and Mark Riskedahl.",
Sarah,Nelson,,,New Mexico,"Please, do not support the Air Quality 2016 Temporary Rules. There is great concern regarding the proposed temporary restrictions to be imposed by the State of Oregon / EQC / DEQ regarding heavy metal emissions in the city of Portland.  I am concerned because there is still a significant lack of understanding of the facts regarding elevated levels of these heavy metals, including the cause of the elevated levels.  I understand that there is a concern for the public health and well-being, however I would point out that there are significant risks associated with implementing public policy based on a public outcry motivated by fear, rather than based on scientific fact.  In the case of Portland, imposing restrictions without understanding the scientific facts runs the risk of causing significant and possibly irreparable economic damage to the glass manufacturing industry in Portland.  Furthermore, there is a greater risk to the public well being by implementing what may possibly be the wrong policy.  If the scientific facts regarding the origin and impacts of the heavy metals are not well understood, the proposed policies may not be effective at correcting the underlying problems, while lulling the public into a false sense of security that would reduce the motivation to investigate the matter appropriately.  This could result in the potential health risks increasing in severity, rather than mitigating those risks because the problem would remain unsolved.  It is for these reasons that I urge the State of Oregon / EQC / DEQ to delay implementing any new restrictions until a thorough scientific investigation of the facts has been conducted.",
Paul,Seer,paul.seer.labor@gmail.com,,OR,"Portland's air quality has been repeatedly documented as being some of the nations worst. Anything you could do to move in the direction of cleaner air would be greatly appreciated. Having said this, the current proposal regarding heavy metal emissions is inadequate as it will allow unexplainably for the emission of chromium 6 at levels 20 times less protective than Oregon's established ambient benchmark. It will also will allow DEQ to unilaterally make decisions that affect human health, including for production to recommence, without adequate public involvement. And lastly, it  will not sufficiently safeguard against ongoing racial injustice and environmental justice disparities caused by toxic air pollution, by too narrowly limiting which facilities will be subject to this rule. Take this opportunity to create a safe standard that addresses all of these concerns, and ensures the safety of our citizens and the cleanliness of our air.",

,Ingersoll,,,Oregon,"As a parent of a former daycare child, pulled from daycare in light of the air pollution findings - I completely agree with the proposed temporary rules being put into effect to protect the public surrounding these glassmaking facilities. 

I would hope that further research will take place to really determine the safety of those exposed, including workers within the glassmaking facilities. 

At the least, if pollution controls are available it is the responsibility of these businesses to take the health and safety of their employees and the public seriously and to install them. I will not feel safe in the community if these businesses are not taking their responsibility seriously by installing proper pollution controls.

I hope that DEQ, OHA, EQC, and business owners work together to ensure beyond a doubt that the public is safe when it comes to air quality exposure. We count on these entities to be experts in their field and to collaborate to make sure events like this one do not occur. ",

We recognize the great need for laws protecting the health of the environment and the public.

Kim,Thomas,Tollertwins@gmail.com,,Washington,"Bullseye Glass has a worldwide reputation as one of the finest glass manufacturers. Their products are in use by thousands of artists all over the world.

Bullseye are obviously acting in an environmentally conscious manner. There have been NO instances where soil and air quality measurements have indicated hazardous measures of anything, but they are voluntarily installing bag houses to filter almost everything out anyway.

Additionnaly, respected PhD's in glass manufacturing have stated that if Cr3 were converted to Cr6 that the glass batches would not be green. They also state that this process is completely under the control of the process engineers.

So unless you are accusing Bullseye of  intentionally polluting, restricting the ability to make these glasses is an action based on speculation (and probably not a small amount of sensationalism in an already bizarre election year).

If you are concerned about human error, there are many, meant OTHER industries that you should be targeting where human error could cause much more disastrous results.

I urge you to both protect American jobs and to protect a well respected American product by NOT enacting these restrictions
But to instead work with Bullseye and the appropriate scientific community to determine what, if any, actions actually need to be taken on the matter of green glasses.",
Fawn,Livingston-Gray,fawnapril@yahoo.com,,OR,"As a neighborhood resident who lives near Bullseye Glass (about a mile away), I support the Eastside Portland Air Coalition requests for changes and expect that the DEQ will keep the safety and health of me and my family, including my 7 year old daughter, as the priority when considering changes. My partner works for a small business so I am not unsympathetic to their needs, but I believe this and other common sense regulation which is already present in other states is reasonable to request of business and, more importantly, necessary to insure our health and safety. ",
Beth,Williams,b_b3@juno.com,,Portland,"DEQ and the EQC seem to be relying on a public panic reaction to guesses derived from an unproven use of mosses as an indicator of heavy metals in the soil.  Other tests since the first panic show that there is no reason to grab up torches and tear off to lynch two businesses in all of Portland, as if they were responsible for all the pollution in the metro area.
This is not the responsible, reasoned approach one would expect from public agencies which have access to experts and proven tests.  It is more like a contagious panic reaction that, instead of seeking a solution to possible, suspected, unproven contamination, is rather more interested in engaging in an overwhelming ""kill response"" merely to quiet the storm of fear that is based on just that:  fear itself.  I would rather that DEQ and EQC take note of scientific studies, rational arguments, proven tests, and the rapid response of Bullseye Glass in ceasing the glass making in question and proceeding with the purchase and installation of the air scrubbers to eliminate any possible contamination of the environment.
Bullseye has been in operation for years, but there are no proven tests to show that there are any health risks caused by their production.  They have workers at their facility who have been there for years and appear to be in fine health.  Recent OHA studies confirm this for their neighborhood, too.  DEQ's own manager of the NW Region Cleanup Program states that there are no ""harmful impacts to soils around the facility"".
This panic attack resulting in an effort to implement draconian rules which will damage and possible destroy these two glass companies is an irrational reaction to a suspected ""maybe"" of a possible problem.  Our community expects more of our agencies than mob-reaction.
Instead, they should formalize as a rule what Bullseye is already doing:  Mandate that they cease production of the glass DEQ is so concerned about until the scrubbers are up and running and then step back, reassure the community, and let Bullseye and Ouruborous live and thrive.
As a further note, in addition to its ominously growing reputation as being unfriendly to artists, Portland is showing an alarming tendency to be unfriendly to small businesses, too, driving a number of them totally out of business or out of the area, into Vancouver and elsewhere.
This treatment of these two businesses, the misuse of the making of temporary rules to protect the public despite tests showing it does not seem to be in any need of emergency protection sends notice to other companies considering coming to this town that rules here depend on reaction to hysterical public outcry rather than fair and accurate information.
Please refrain from imposing these rules and let these two companies install air scrubbers so that they can get back into production of glasses needed around the world.

My own business is in a residential neighborhood so I am well aware of the sensitivities that are required to operate in a community where families live.

They have voluntarily stopped the usage of any materials that may pose a danger. This Temporary Rulemaking is unnecessary and boils down to political showboating.

At this time, we are very concerned about our continued livelihoods within the glass industry, the new costs that will be associated with glass due to long term decreased productions, DEQ environmental protection requirements that may be unnecessary for small business/small glass manufactures, and in general overall public fear that has been placed that we feel can and has hurt not only the glass manufactures but glass artists as well.  Media perception has done a job even halfway across the country.

Christopher,Eykamp,chris@eykamp.com,,Oregon,"Dear Commissioners Oâ€™Keeffe, Armstrong, Rider, Johnson, and Eden,

Thank you for allowing the public to have an opportunity to comment on the DEQ's proposed temporary rules governing the emission of toxic materials by Portland glass makers.  I understand this is an unusual step, but I think circumstances require it.

* The rules should apply to all emitters of toxic metals, and should include smaller-scale producers.  One of my primary concerns is that the rules seem very narrowly tailored to medium-sized art-glass manufacturers, even though the moss data shows there are many more facilities emitting hazardous levels of carcinogenic metals into Portland's air.  Please broaden the scope of the rules so that they apply to all emitters, not just those in the glass industry.  Furthermore, the minimum size of facility regulated is rather large.  I would request that the minimum size be dropped to a single ton of raw materials per year, and that you count cullet and other recycled glass as a raw material for this purpose.

* The rules should apply across Oregon.  Toxic emissions from uncontrolled sources are not only a problem in Portland, but across the state.  Residents of other jurisdictions are as deserving of protection as those in Portland.  Please do not restrict these rules to a narrow geographic area.

* The rules must prevent emission of hexavalent chromium.  Hexavalent chromium is highly carcinogenic.  There seems to be confusion about how much hexavalent is emitted while making glass, but I am particularly concerned about hot chromium interfacing with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, which should create conditions conducive to formation of hexavalent chromium.  No form of chromium should be allowed in an uncontrolled furnace.

* There must be penalties for violation.  The proposed rules appear to have no enforceable penalty provision.  There needs to be specific, quantifiable penalties for breaking the rules, severe enough to discourage evasion. Rules without penalties become mere guidelines.

* Filtration must be backstopped with monitoring.  Stack monitoring should be part of any comprehensive emission control system, and should be required on every controlled and uncontrolled furnace.

* There must be strict separation between controlled and uncontrolled furnaces.  The current proposals do not provide a mechanism for tracking materials used in controlled and uncontrolled furnaces.  There needs to be a protocol and documentation to ensure that no hazardous materials are used in an uncontrolled furnace, either by accident, or as a matter of expediency.

Thank you,

Chris Eykamp

Tom,Warren,trw204@gmail.com,self-employed artist,Oregon,"I read the DEQ proposed rules and I have some general comments.  I'm a Portland artist, working with different materials including fused glass manufactured by Bullseye and Uroboros.    As an artist, I am very disappointed with the response from many glass artists outside of Portland.  Their attacks on the integrity of community members who are concerned with air pollution are despicable.  I urge the DEQ and the EQC to pay close attention to the input from local citizens concerned with hazardous pollutants in their neighborhood. 

The EQC and the DEQ have an opportunity right now to improve the lives of Oregonians, especially those who live in close proximity to glass production facilities.   You can right the wrong that was inflicted on some Portland residents when art glass factories chose to operate without considering the safety of their surroundings.  

DEQ and EQC should prioritize actions that clean and preserve the environment and promote public health.  These are vital to the community we live in and, without this priority, Portland will become an industrial ghost town.

A friend of mine who moved to Portland from New Jersey, told me once that New Jersey has better environmental regulations and enforcement than Oregon.  This could only happen because industrial profits were prioritized over pollution control.  It is unacceptable that New Jersey has better environmental quality control than Oregon.

I support EPAC and Neighbors for Clean Air.  I agree with EPAC and NCA's proposals regarding the DEQ temporary rules.  If art glass production is to continue and thrive in Portland, it must be done safely, in controlled furnaces.  

We are doing this for the health of our children and our neighborhoods.

Mary,Volm,mevolm@gmail.com,Mary Volm Fine Artist,Oregon,"I am urging the EQC to not adopt the proposed temporary rules limiting metal emisions for small colored glass for a variety of reasons.

First and foremost is the science, or lack thereof, behind these rules. Q quickly drafted these rules because the spotlight, deservedly so, was shifting from glass manufacturers to DEQ.  The science is unproven and and disputed by many in the field of heavy metal heat transformation.  The knee-jerk reaction of DEQ is just that, without the science to back it up.

Which leads me to my second point, the glass companies themselves.  As a glass artist of 15 years, I have the highest regard for Bullseye Glass.  As a customer, I have worked with them for as many years, taken countless classes, attended international conferences with artists who have worked in the this field far longer than me, and had many factory tours .  Science and chemical actions and reactions is the foundation of this company.  They have always been conscious of potential challenges in the creation of art glass and have taught us all very well how to keep ourselves safe in our own studios.

Thirdly, there are many of us locally, regionally and internationally who have made huge investments in studios and equipment to work in this medium.  Taking colors away will put me out of business immediately. My work is highly saturated color and without it, I can not create my work.  I have waited a lifetime to pursue my art and invested everything I have in this medium.  Even just a few months without materials will set me back that it is likely I would not be able to recover.

Finally, I have worked as communications director for both the State of Oregon and The City of Portland for over 25 years.  At the City, I created the Clean Air Fair (recruiting DEQ and other public agencies in the region) to educate citizens on alternative methods to gas powered vehicles and equipment. I have worked tirelessly to encourage people to make good choices.  I am asking you to do the same.  Bullseye Glass suspended the use of heavy metals immediately after the first findings, went to the research bench as well as the marketplace seeking solutions, which they have already employed, and all the while making glass that isn't sellable in order to keep their employees gainfully employed.  Why not allow the tests on the new filtration systems be allowed to be tested and modified if needed in the next few months?  It is beyond a reasonable request.  

I know many of the research staff and education staff at bullseye.  I have the highest respect for each and every one of them.  They are very much a part of this community and care about the livability of our neighborhoods as I do,proven through my years in public service around these issues.
