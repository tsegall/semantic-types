While engaged in private practice, Chair Hardie provided legal advice to PacifiCorp after the company had developed and filed these avoided cost prices.  Although Chair Hardie’s advice was extremely limited and primarily procedural in nature, she has decided to participate in this matter only to the extent required to reach a quorum for Commission decision.  Chair Hardie’s decision to limit her participation is not legally required, but taken out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of fair and open proceedings.  Because Commissioner Savage will be out of the office and not available to participate in the August 2, 2016 Regular Public Meeting,  PacifiCorp’s Schedule 37 update will be rescheduled to be heard at a later date.",08/02/2016 09:30:00 AM,08/02/2016 12:00:00 PM,"201 High Street SE, Hearing Room",Salem,OR,,,Kristi Collins,503-373-0885,kristi.collins@state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PM Agenda 08022016.docx (https://data.oregon.gov/views/gs36-7t8m/files/8a7599fb-7844-4347-8f8a-096a24a7bc7a?download=true&filename=PM%20Agenda%2008022016.docx),,,

Fish and Wildlife Department,Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission Meeting,"The Fish and Wildlife commission will meet Friday, Aug. 5 at the ODFW Headquarters in Salem to adopt 2017 sportfishing and 2016 coastal coho regulations, as well as mule deer and elk management objectives.  The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at ODFW, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem. The meeting agenda is at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/16/08_august/index.asp",08/05/2016 08:00:00 AM,08/05/2016 05:00:00 PM,4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem,OR,"The Fish and Wildlife commission will meet Friday, Aug. 5 at the ODFW Headquarters in Salem to adopt 2017 sportfishing and 2016 coastal coho regulations, as well as mule deer and elk management objectives.

The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at ODFW, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem. The meeting agenda is at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/16/08_august/index.asp

In the morning during the Director’s Report, the Chair of the Joint Interim Task Force On Funding for Fish, Wildlife, and Related Outdoor Recreation and Education will give a status update on their work to date. The Task Force was created by HB 2402 to develop recommendations to strengthen the State’s ability to conserve natural resources and connect the diversity of Oregonians to nature through outdoor recreation and education.

Also during the Director’s Report, ODFW staff will provide informational updates on the Wolf Management Plan Review process, recent stakeholder meetings and a revised schedule for the Wolf Plan review. There will be no public testimony during this briefing.

The Commission will also be asked to adopt 2017 sportfishing regulations. The majority of the changes being proposed are housekeeping corrections building on last year’s effort to simplify the regulations. A few more significant proposed changes are:

The portion of the Lower Deschutes River River that borders the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation will be open April 22-Dec. 31 (reverting back to regulations in effect prior to 2016).
Multiple Lower Columbia tributaries will only be open to the harvest of hatchery salmon to protect wild tule fall Chinook. The majority of salmon in these areas are hatchery fish so this change is expected to have minimal impact on fishing opportunities but will provide necessary protections for listed wild fish.
New regulations and an updated map to more clearly designate the fishing areas in Herman Creek located in the Columbia River Zone.
Additionally, the Commission will be asked to approve several Restoration and Enhancement Projects and appoint Rod Moore to the board as the Seafood Processor Representative. R and E funds projects that enhance fish production and provide more public access to fishing waters.

The Commission will be asked to adopt wild coastal coho fishing regulations. ODFW staff are proposing limited fishing this year due to a low expected return. Fishing would be allowed in the Umpqua, Coos, Coquille Rivers and Tenmile Lakes, with Siltcoos and Tahkenitch lakes open under permanent regulations.

Finally, the Commission will consider mule deer and elk management objectives (MOs) which ODFW reviews periodically. Many of Oregon’s 67 wildlife management units have a winter population MO (the number of mule deer or elk desired in the unit during the winter) and a buck and bull ratio MO (the ratio of buck mule deer or bull elk observed per 100 females after the hunting season).

MOs are not the maximum number of animals a unit can support, but a compromise to maintain deer and elk numbers at levels compatible with primary land uses, limit damage to private property while maximizing recreational benefits (hunting and wildlife viewing).

Public testimony for topics not on the agenda will be held first thing Friday morning, just after the adoption of temporary rules. Persons seeking to testify on issues not on the formal agenda may do so by making arrangements with the ODFW Director’s Office, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, by calling 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044.

Reasonable accommodations will be provided as needed for individuals requesting assistive hearing devices, sign language interpreters or large-print materials. Individuals needing these types of accommodations may call the ODFW Director’s Office at 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044 at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting.

The Commission is the policy-making body for fish and wildlife issues in the state and it usually meets monthly.",yes,Michelle Dennehy,(503) 931-2748,Michelle.N.Dennehy@state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Justice Department,Attorney General's Public Records Law Reform Task Force,Public Hearing,08/18/2016 04:30:00 PM,08/18/2016 06:00:00 PM,Public Library in the Brooks Room located at 601 N.W. Wall Street ,Bend,OR,"Members of the Attorney General's Public Records Law Reform Task Force will be accepting public comments on the Oregon Public Records Law, and the work of the task force. Please join us to share your experiences, suggestions, or other thoughts with task force members.

All are welcome to attend.

Information about the work of the task force is available on the Public Records Law Reform Task Force website. Currently, that work is focused primarily on the hundreds of disclosure exemptions that keep information out of public hands - and can make the law difficult to implement. Other issues that the task force expects to examine include the cost and timeliness of public records disclosures. The task force wants to hear from Oregonians on these and other public records law subjects.

Here is a link to a map of downtown Bend: http://www.downtownbend.org/explore-downtown/map-of-downtown/ 

We are meeting in the Brooks room of the Library marked on the lower left of the map. There is public parking across the street from the library.

Oregon’s coordinated care model was created in 2011 as part of Oregon’s ongoing health system transformation. The 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) deliver physical, oral and behavioral health services to nearly 90 percent of Oregon’s 1.1 million Medicaid recipients.

As part of the OHPB’s mission to improve and monitor community-centered health initiatives, it will analyze the current model for opportunities to further advance health system transformation and to inform the 2017 Oregon Legislature. OHPB will gather input from consumers, advocates, primary care providers, and other stakeholders, and then develop recommendations to the Legislature for continued system improvements toward the goal of providing Oregonians with better health and better care at a lower cost.

“We’re excited to hear directly from Oregonians who are served by or work with coordinated care organizations,” said Zeke Smith, Chair of the Oregon Health Policy Board. “We want to hear ideas about how to better provide access to high-quality, affordable health care for all Oregonians.

Oregon’s coordinated care model was created in 2011 as part of Oregon’s ongoing health system transformation. The 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) deliver physical, oral and behavioral health services to nearly 90 percent of Oregon’s 1.1 million Medicaid recipients.

As part of the OHPB’s mission to improve and monitor community-centered health initiatives, it will analyze the current model for opportunities to further advance health system transformation and to inform the 2017 Oregon Legislature. OHPB will gather input from consumers, advocates, primary care providers, and other stakeholders, and then develop recommendations to the Legislature for continued system improvements toward the goal of providing Oregonians with better health and better care at a lower cost.

“We’re excited to hear directly from Oregonians who are served by or work with coordinated care organizations,” said Zeke Smith, chair of the Oregon Health Policy Board. “We want to hear ideas about how to better provide access to high-quality, affordable health care for all Oregonians.

The Oregon Public Transportation Plan (OPTP) will provide a statewide vision and policy foundation for decisions about public transportation in and between Oregon communities. This plan will not identify projects or local investments, but it will set priorities and policies to guide future decisions and investments by state and local agencies. 

ODOT is inviting public transportation providers, local government staff and officials, interest groups, the public, and other interested parties to discuss challenges and opportunities for public transportation at meetings around the state in September and October or by participating in an online open house. The draft vision and goals for the plan will be shared. Feedback will help to inform plan development and the future of public transportation in Oregon. The online open house will accept comments from Sept. 7 to Oct. 28 and can be accessed through the project website at www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/Pages/optp.aspx

Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission will meet September 13-14 in Bend 

Bend OR - The Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission will hold its fourth meeting of the year Sept. 13-14 in Bend, Oregon. 

On Sept. 13, Commissioners will gather at 8 a.m. tour of state parks in the area, followed by a work session and training at 1:30 p.m. with the director of Washington State Parks. 

On Sept. 14, Commissioners will convene an executive session at 8:30 a.m. at the Riverbed Community Room, 799 Southwest Columbia Street, to discuss real estate and legal issues. Executive sessions are closed to the public. A public business meeting will begin at 10:30 a.m. at the same location. The agenda includes several information and action items from agency staff, including requests to: 

* Approve a master plan for Sitka Sedge State Natural Area, a not-yet-open 357-acre park in southern Tillamook County. The plan helps guide future recreation use and resource management on this ecologically diverse property that encompasses beaches, dunes, woodlands and both fresh- and saltwater marshes. Commission approval will allow the department to move forward on opening the park in 2017. OPRD purchased the property in September 2014 with Oregon Lottery dollars dedicated to state parks. More information is online https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PLANS/Pages/Beltz-Property.aspx 

* Adopt minor changes to make the reservation process more efficient for customers and the agency. 

* Award more than $850,000 in parks grants to local governments through the Local Government Grants Program, funded by Oregon Lottery dollars. 

Following the business meeting, commissioners will attend a 4:30 p.m. reception at Hollinshead Park, 1235 NE Jones Road. 

The draft agenda and meeting are online at http://bit.ly/september2016agenda. People who plan to present testimony are requested to provide 15 copies of their statement to Commission Assistant Jen Busey at jen.busey@oregon.gov for distribution to the Commissioners before the meeting. Those needing special accommodations to attend should also contact Busey by email, or by calling 503-986-0719, at least three days in advance. 

The Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission (www.oregon.gov/oprd/Pages/commission.aspx) promotes outdoor recreation and heritage by establishing policies, adopting rules, and setting the budget for the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. The seven members are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Oregon Senate. They serve four-year terms and meet several times a year at locations across the state.

The Oregon Public Transportation Plan (OPTP) will provide a statewide vision and policy foundation for decisions about public transportation in and between Oregon communities. This plan will not identify projects or local investments, but it will set priorities and policies to guide future decisions and investments by state and local agencies. 

ODOT is inviting public transportation providers, local government staff and officials, interest groups, the public, and other interested parties to discuss challenges and opportunities for public transportation at meetings around the state in September and October or by participating in an online open house. The draft vision and goals for the plan will be shared. Feedback will help to inform plan development and the future of public transportation in Oregon. The online open house will accept comments from Sept. 7 to Oct. 28 and can be accessed through the project website at www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/Pages/optp.aspx

Oregon’s coordinated care model was created in 2011 as part of Oregon’s ongoing health system transformation. The 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) deliver physical, oral and behavioral health services to nearly 90 percent of Oregon’s 1.1 million Medicaid recipients.

As part of the OHPB’s mission to improve and monitor community-centered health initiatives, it will analyze the current model for opportunities to further advance health system transformation and to inform the 2017 Oregon Legislature. OHPB will gather input from consumers, advocates, primary care providers, and other stakeholders, and then develop recommendations to the Legislature for continued system improvements toward the goal of providing Oregonians with better health and better care at a lower cost.

“We’re excited to hear directly from Oregonians who are served by or work with coordinated care organizations,” said Zeke Smith, chair of the Oregon Health Policy Board. “We want to hear ideas about how to better provide access to high-quality, affordable health care for all Oregonians.

Health Policy Board,Coordinated care organizations listening session,,09/26/2016 12:00:00 PM,09/26/2016 02:30:00 PM,"Unitarian Universalist Church, 1685 W 13th Ave.", Eugene,OR,"The Oregon Health Policy Board (OHPB), a nine-member group appointed by the Governor to oversee health policy at the Oregon Health Authority, will hold a series of community meetings across the state in September and October to gather public input about Oregon’s coordinated care organizations (CCOs) and how they deliver services to Oregon’s most vulnerable citizens.

Oregon’s coordinated care model was created in 2011 as part of Oregon’s ongoing health system transformation. The 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) deliver physical, oral and behavioral health services to nearly 90 percent of Oregon’s 1.1 million Medicaid recipients.

As part of the OHPB’s mission to improve and monitor community-centered health initiatives, it will analyze the current model for opportunities to further advance health system transformation and to inform the 2017 Oregon Legislature. OHPB will gather input from consumers, advocates, primary care providers, and other stakeholders, and then develop recommendations to the Legislature for continued system improvements toward the goal of providing Oregonians with better health and better care at a lower cost.

“We’re excited to hear directly from Oregonians who are served by or work with coordinated care organizations,” said Zeke Smith, chair of the Oregon Health Policy Board. “We want to hear ideas about how to better provide access to high-quality, affordable health care for all Oregonians.”

Please RSVP to HealthPolicyBoard.Info@state.or.us.

The Oregon Public Transportation Plan (OPTP) will provide a statewide vision and policy foundation for decisions about public transportation in and between Oregon communities. This plan will not identify projects or local investments, but it will set priorities and policies to guide future decisions and investments by state and local agencies. 

ODOT is inviting public transportation providers, local government staff and officials, interest groups, the public, and other interested parties to discuss challenges and opportunities for public transportation at meetings around the state in September and October or by participating in an online open house. The draft vision and goals for the plan will be shared. Feedback will help to inform plan development and the future of public transportation in Oregon. The online open house will accept comments from Sept. 7 to Oct. 28 and can be accessed through the project website at www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/Pages/optp.aspx
