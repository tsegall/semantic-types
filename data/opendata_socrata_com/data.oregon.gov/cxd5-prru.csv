At its business meeting in Canyonville on April 14, the board will hear from a subcommittee on alternative management plans for the State Forests and also take up other agenda items. 

Riparian protection rule analysis
Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) staff will report on ongoing work to analyze proposed forest practice rule prescriptions designed to maintain cold water in streams. They will also discuss emerging policy issues pertaining to riparian (streamside) protection.

Compliance with leave-tree and downed-wood regulations
Landowners in Oregon’s Coast Range are 97 percent compliant with forest practice regulations that require them to leave green trees or snags and downed logs when conducting clearcut timber harvests, according to a completed study. The Oregon Forest Practices Act calls for their retention to provide wildlife habitat and maintain healthy soil.  

Alternative forest management plans
ODF staff will describe progress in evaluating alternative forest management plans for the northwestern Oregon State Forests. Last June, the board directed ODF to explore alternative forest management plans that would be financially viable and improve conservation outcomes. 

High-value conservation areas
The board will receive an update on ODF’s efforts to implement an administrative rule change adopted last year that created the new “high-value conservation area” land management classification on the State Forests of Oregon. 

Fire policy panel
A panel will provide perspectives on fire policy and land management objectives across different forestland ownerships in Oregon. 

Subcommittee on federal forests
A board subcommittee on federal forests will update the full board on its draft work plan. The subcommittee focuses on federal forest policy issues, with an aim to help the board interact with the governor's office, the Oregon congressional delegation, the Legislature and others on management of the 18 million acres of federally owned forestland in the state.

Department of Forestry fiscal report, 2015-17 budget development
The board will receive an update on the department’s current financial status. Planning and development of the next Oregon state biennial budget got underway in mid-March, and ODF staff will review the work to date on policy packages, which will evolve into more specific budget concepts.    

April 14 meeting details
The board meeting will begin at 9 a.m. in the Birch-Cedar Room at the Seven Feathers Convention Center, 146 Chief Miwaleta Lane, in Canyonville. A general public comment period is scheduled near the start of the meeting. Public comment on specific agenda items will be received as the board takes them up. Agenda materials are available at www.oregon.gov/odf/Pages/board/index.aspx, (2014 meeting link).

Special needs
Accommodations for people with disabilities, and special materials, services or assistance can be arranged by calling the department’s Public Affairs Office at least 48 hours in advance, at 503-945-7200.

April 15 field tour details
The board will meet for a field tour outside of Glendale near the site of the 2013 Douglas Complex fires. The tour will examine the complexity of forest management, wildfire management, and post-fire salvage and restoration operations in the context of multiple public and private landowner objectives. A tour briefing will be held at 8 a.m. in the Cedar Room at the Seven Feathers Convention Center in Canyonville. Members of the public wishing to join the tour are asked to provide their own lunch and transportation.

About the board
The Board of Forestry consists of seven citizens nominated by the governor and confirmed by the Oregon Senate. Responsibilities include appointing the state forester, setting management direction for state-owned forests, adopting rules governing timber harvest and other practices on private forestland, and promoting sustainable management of Oregon’s 30 million-acre forestland base.

The Authority needs to amend this rule to set forth the form and manner for health practitioners to provide notice of patient choice related to referrals for diagnostic tests, health care services or treatment. 

The proposed rule provides for written or oral notice of patient choice at the time the patient establishes care and that notice must also be posted in a conspicuous place.  The rule sets forth the information that must be provided. When health practitioners choose to provide notice at the time of referral, the rule sets forth the information that the practitioner must provide.  Practitioners must document all oral notices. Implementation of this rule will ensure that health care consumers are aware of their right to choose care providers.

Salem OR – Proposed rules that would restrict smoking of tobacco products on the ocean shore recreation area will be open for public comment through August 29, 2014. Comments will be taken by email, and through a series of four public hearings in August.

Rules that restrict smoking on Oregon state park properties were approved in February by the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission. Education about the new rule is taking place through 2014, and enforcement will begin in 2015. Previous public comments related to the state park rule asked the department to undertake a similar effort on the ocean shore, which is adjacent to many state parks. Citing environmental issues as a primary concern—plastic cigarette butts can persist for years, even in the harsh beach environment—the commission approved a staff request to consider a smoking rule for the ocean shore.

After listening to public comment between now and August 29, the department plans to present information to the Commission on September 17 at its meeting near Silverton, and return November 19 with a final recommendation at the Astoria meeting.

Public comment will play a key role in the decision to create a rule. Comments can be sent to the department through regular mail (OPRD Beach Smoking, 725 Summer St NE, Suite C, Salem OR 97301), by e-mail (oprd.publiccomment@oregon.gov), or in person at one of four public hearings scheduled in August. All hearings begin at 7 p.m. at the locations listed below.
