The Program requires
employers that do not provide a Qualified Retirement plan facilitate payroll contributions so that employees may
contribute to a retirement savings plan account in the Program. Employees may opt out of the Program at any time.
Existing law grants the Oregon Retirement Savings Board the authority to adopt rules for the general administration of
the Program, including the authority to collect administrative fees. The proposed rules contained in this notice provide
additional flexibility to the Board in structuring the administrative fees. In addition, the proposed rules extend the time
for the smallest of employers to comply with registration requirements and also clarify employers' responsibilities in the
