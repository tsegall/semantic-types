See the meeting agenda and watch a livestream of the meeting at https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/22/08_Aug/index.asp

To testify on an agenda item remotely, register at least 48 hours in advance (by Wednesday,  Aug. 3 at 8 a.m.) at this link 

To testify in-person, sign up on the day of the meeting at ODFW HQ. Sign- up sheets are available outside the Commission room.

Comments can also be emailed to odfw.commission@odfw.oregon.gov

A public forum for people to comment on topics not on the agenda is scheduled for Friday morning after the Director's report. To participate in the public forum, contact the ODFW Director's office at (503) 947-6044 or email  ODFW.Commission@odfw.oregon.gov  by Wednesday, Aug. 3 at 8 a.m. (48 hours prior to the meeting).

The following business is on the Commission’s agenda: 
Role of ODFW lands for marbled murrelet conservation: Per the Oregon Endangered Species Act (OESA), the Commission will determine the role ODFW-owned lands will play in marbled murrelet conservation. Where feasible, forested habitat on ODFW lands would be managed to contribute to their conservation and all relevant ODFW lands will continue to implement the survival guidelines for the marbled murrelet. Staff will also provide an update on the determinations of roles by other state land owning and managing agencies per OESA requirements.

Fall Chinook conservation hatchery program for the Coquille River: The number of naturally-produced adult fall Chinook salmon returning to the Coquille River basin has been severely depressed since 2018 and the population is at high risk of extirpation. In coordination with the Coquille Indian Tribe, ODFW is proposing to initiate a Conservation Hatchery Program as an emergency measure to boost natural production and provide time to address the limiting factors which include predation by non-native fish.
Interim hatchery measures are needed to ensure the genetic legacy of the population is preserved and that there are sufficient adults returning to avoid extirpation before other recovery actions can be completed.

Adopt 2023 Sport Fishing Regulations: The few changes proposed to next year’s fishing regulations include moving to catch-and-release only for wild rainbow trout in the Fall River to help conserve wild populations. A change in zone regulations to standardize bass fishing regulations in streams (lifting size and number limits) will both simplify regulations by removing a number of redundant special regulations and help conserve native species where they overlap with bass populations. See the complete list of proposals online.

Other changes to sport fishing regulations already adopted by the Commission and the Oregon State Legislature will also be included in the rule adoption, including the Rogue-South Coast Plan, changes to license offerings and changes to bag limits for green crab.   

ODFW staff will also brief the Commission on activities related to beaver management in Oregon and provide an update on implementation of the Private Forest Accord passed by the 2022 Oregon State Legislature.

"Parks and Recreation, Oregon",Rulemaking - State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation,Public comment period opens on changes to comment process for historic preservation committee,05/23/2022 06:00:00 PM,05/23/2022 08:00:00 PM,Zoom,Salem,OR,"The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRD) is accepting public comments on proposed changes to the comment process during meetings of the State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation (SACHP), which reviews nominations to the National Register of Historic Places. The deadline for comments is 5 p.m. May 31.

OPRD is proposing updates to the Oregon Administrative Rules that govern how individuals submit comments during public meetings of the SACHP. Under the proposed rule, comments would be submitted to OPRD staff who would share them with committee members during the meeting. Any comments not material to the nomination would not be shared.

The proposed rule is similar to a temporary rule put into place in November 2021 after a virtual meeting of the committee was interrupted when an attendee began typing racial and homophobic slurs directed at members of the committee. Without action, the rule language would revert to its prior form. In order for the temporary rule language to become permanent, the agency must open the proposed amendment for public comment and follow the rule adoption process.

“Under the proposed rule, the committee will continue to hear all comments relevant to the listing criteria,” said Ian Johnson, Associate Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer. “The purpose is not to censor comments, but to prevent hate speech from interrupting a meeting.” 

OPRD will accept public comments on the proposed changes at a virtual public hearing set to stream on Zoom at 6 p.m. May 23. Register to attend at https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_jvfmGbyARu-YJDQol8nFWw.

Comments may also be submitted via the following channels:
•	Online: https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PRP/pages/PRP-rulemaking.aspx
•	In writing: Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, attn. Katie Gauthier, 725 Summer St NE, Suite C, Salem OR 97301
•	Email: OPRD.publiccomment@oprd.oregon.gov
After reviewing public comments, OPRD staff plan to present a final recommended rule for consideration to the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission.

The full text of the proposed change is available online at https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PRP/pages/PRP-rulemaking.aspx

SALEM, Ore.—The Fish and Wildlife Commission meets Friday, May 13 online to be briefed on a proposed 2023-25 ODFW budget and consider funding of an Oregon Conservation & Recreation Fund grant request.

The meeting begins at 8 a.m. and will be livestreamed over ODFW’s YouTube channel. See the agenda and view the meeting here https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/22/05_May/index.asp

To testify on the budget briefing or the OCRF proposal, register at least 48 hours in advance (so by Wednesday, May 11 at 8 a.m.) at this link https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/22/05_May/index.asp

Comments can also be emailed to odfw.commission@odfw.oregon.gov 

ODFW’s proposed 2023-25 budget does not include a proposed fee increase for recreational hunting or fishing licenses, meaning the agency will have gone almost a full decade without asking for an additional fee increase. Typically, ODFW asks for a fee increase every six years, but the agency has been able to build up healthy operational reserves and can delay increasing fees for another biennium. The increase in license sales during the pandemic helped offset the need for a fee increases. (The last fee increase request was approved in the 2015 Legislative Session and implemented incrementally in 2016, 2018 and 2020.)

As part of the agenda item, the Commission will also be asked to prioritize requests for Policy Option Packages (POPs), which are requests for new programs/positions and funding that require Legislative approval. These include additional positions related to climate resiliency, water planning and flow restoration, habitat protection, fish research and restoration, as well as for deferred maintenance, fish passage and other programs.
The discussion with the Commission is just one of many steps in ODFW’s process to develop a budget that also included input from an External Budget Advisory Committee of key stakeholders and a series of public listening sessions (one for each region of the state).The Commission is expected to take final action on the budget proposal at its June 17 meeting. Once a budget is approved by the Commission, it goes to the Governor who will submit a state budget for the Legislature to consider during the 2023 session.  

The Commission will also be briefed on recommendations from the Beaver Work Group, a group created by the Commission to explore beaver management that met 12 times over the past year. Their report includes recommendations for beaver management on federal lands. No public testimony will be taken during this portion of the meeting. 

Finally, the Commission will be briefed on Southern Resident killer whales.

An Executive Session may be held pursuant to ORS 192.660 (2)(f) to consider information or records that are exempt by law from public inspection, as well as to consult with legal counsel concerning legal rights and duties regarding current litigation likely to be filed as authorized by ORS 192.660 (2)(h).  Representatives of the news media may attend the executive session by contacting the Director's Office prior to the meeting. Representatives of the news media are specifically directed not to report on any of the deliberations during the executive session, except to state the general subject of the session.

HB 3389 went into effect September 25, 2021. It modified various statutory provisions addressing the UI Trust Fund, which funds Oregon's UI benefit programs. The bill reduces UI taxes for employers who laid off employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic and through no fault of their own. Oregon received federal guidance after the passage of HB 3389. The guidance required specific language in statute, or rule, to clarify that the modifications to the UI Trust Fund were specifically to address impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.",,Anne Friend,,OED_RULES@employ.oregon.gov,,,,Anne Friend,,OED_Rules@employ.oregon.gov,true,https://www.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_N7Jew-imS2yKQdNoudc4kQ,,,,,,,,,,,

Revenue Department,Rules advisory committee meeting about recalculating the maximum assessed value of properties,,03/28/2022 10:30:00 AM,03/28/2022 12:30:00 PM,Virtual Zoom meeting,Salem,OR,"The Oregon Department of Revenue (DOR) will be holding the second in an ongoing series of Rules Advisory Committee (RAC) meetings on March 28, 2022. The RAC will help the department develop administrative rules to determine how to recalculate the maximum assessed value (MAV) of properties participating in partial exemptions of assessed value (AV). 

Property is taxed on its AV, which is the lower of its real market value or its MAV. A property’s MAV is the taxable value limit established for each property, in accordance with Article XI, Section 11 of the Oregon Constitution.

In developing the administrative rules, the department is interested in identifying which taxpayers will benefit and which will be disadvantaged by the recalculation of MAV of property as well as how to minimize the magnitude of the effects.

At its second meeting on March 28, 2022, the RAC will be briefed on a recent study of tax accounts commonly affected by partial exemptions of AV. They will begin to explore options for potential draft rule language and practical examples of the outcome of each option for taxpayers.

The RAC is an important part of the rule-adoption process and DOR wants to ensure affected taxpayers provide input during the consideration of possible rules. The meeting will be open to the public who can listen to the virtual meeting through the Zoom link below. A portion of the meeting agenda will allow an opportunity for public comment.

"Parks and Recreation, Oregon",State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation (SACHP) Meeting,Meeting to consider nominations to the National Register of Historic Places.,02/18/2022 09:00:00 AM,02/18/2022 12:30:00 PM,Zoom,Salem,OR,"SALEM, Ore. – The State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation (SACHP) will meet February 18 via conference call to consider nominations to the National Register of Historic Places. This meeting is open to the public. 

The SACHP meeting will begin at 9:00 a.m. to consider nominations to the National Register. Anyone may listen to the meeting and instructions on how to attend will be posted on the commission web page prior to the meeting. 

Friday’s meeting agenda: hearings of one proposed delisting and three proposed nominations. 

For specific hearing times, refer to the online agenda: www.oregonheritage.org (click on “Commissions & Committees” at top of page and look under “State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation”). 

The committee will review one proposed delisting petition: The Sumpter Valley Railway, Middle Fork (John Day River) Spur, Grant County.

The committee will review three proposed nominations: Phoenix Pharmacy, Portland; Sarah Helmick State Park, Monmouth vcty.; Portland Golf Club Clubhouse, Washington County.

This effort aligns with the Oregon Historic Preservation Plan goal to increase the thematic diversity of Oregon properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It also supports the goals to include more voices and increase access to Oregon heritage that are part of the Oregon Heritage Plan. 

Nominations recommended by the SACHP go to the National Park Service, which maintains the Register under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.

The SACHP is a nine-member governor-appointed citizen commission with credentials in many historic preservation-related fields. 

More information about the National Register of Historic Places process is online at www.oregonheritage.org (click on “National Register” at left of page).

A public forum for people to comment on topics not on the agenda is scheduled for Friday morning after the Director's report. To participate in the public forum, contact the ODFW Director's office at (503) 947-6044 or email ODFW.Commission@odfw.oregon.gov  by Wednesday, Feb. 16 at 8 a.m. (48 hours prior to the meeting).

The Commission is expected to consider:
An MOU with the Grand Ronde Tribe for harvest of shellfish by tribal members in the Trask Unit and the ocean adjacent to the unit including Tillamook Bay. If approved, tribal members could harvest shellfish under a special gathering permit (rather than a recreational shellfish license). Tribal members would follow Oregon Sport Fishing Regulations regarding species, daily bag limits, sizes, harvest methods and seasons. 

An updated 10-year Culvert Repair Programmatic Agreement which allows ODOT to make temporary repairs to state highway system culverts if a significant fish passage improvement can be provided. The agreement allows more flexibility to implement short term repairs at failing culverts while giving ODOT more time to plan for replacement of culverts (when full fish passage requirements are applied).  As part of the agreement, ODOT is required to contribute monies into a Fish Passage Compensation Fund, which is used to address high priority fish passage issues statewide. Many priority barriers have had fish passage restored thanks to the funds created under the CRPA since this program was first established in 2015.

Amend rules to increase shellfish transport biosecurity: Oregon is home to about 20 shellfish mariculture facilities (e.g. shellfish farms). Transport of shellfish can inadvertently spread unwanted pests, viruses, and pathogens—including the Oyster Herpes Virus microvariant-1 (OsHV-1) which causes very high mortality rates in shellfish and was detected in cultivated Pacific Oysters in San Diego, Calif. in 2019. Proposed new regulations will tighten transport rules to protect Oregon’s mariculture industry and shellfish including updating activities and definitions of species groups that require a permit; updating required information for permit; and identifying shellfish pathologists approved to certify shellfish health.

Adopt rules for regional dry maintenance time periods: In keeping with HB 2437 passed by the 2019 Oregon State Legislature, the Commission will be asked to adopt a part of these new rules that simplify the regulatory process for maintaining channels used for agricultural drainage. ODFW’s role in the regulatory process (which is primarily managed by ODA) is to establish regional dry maintenance time periods for removal of material. The time periods proposed are designed to minimize potential impacts during the most vulnerable life stages of fish and wildlife species including migration, spawning and rearing in the channels and adjacent waterways and also consider the effect of sedimentation on species downstream of the channels.

Amend rules for commercial squid fishery to establish a limited entry control date and modify net specifications: The commercial market squid fishery is a relatively new and welcome opportunity in Oregon, and the Commission adopted several rules in March 2021 to promote sustainability of the resource and fishery. Uncertainty about appropriate catch and participation levels and other questions remain so staff are proposing additional regulation changes and information for future consideration.

The Commission will also hear updates on the current population status of lower Columbia River white sturgeon and a review of 2021 sturgeon fisheries. 

The Commission may also meet in executive session (held pursuant to ORS 192.660 (2)(f)) to consider information or records that are exempt by law from public inspection, as well as to consult with legal counsel concerning legal rights and duties regarding current litigation likely to be filed as authorized by ORS 192.660 (2)(h). Representatives of the news media and may attend the executive session by contacting the Director's Office prior to the meeting. Representatives of the news media are specifically directed not to report on any of the deliberations during the executive session, except to state the general subject of the session as previously announced.

Fish and Wildlife Department,Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission Meeting ,Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission meets Dec. 17 to adopt Rogue-South Coast Plan for native fish,12/17/2021 08:00:00 AM,12/17/2021 05:00:00 PM, 4034 Fairview Industrial DR SE - Virtual ,Salem,OR,"Friday’s meeting begins at 8 a.m. See the agenda for both meetings and view a livestream of the meeting at https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/

To testify on one of the agenda items, register no later than 48 hours before the meeting (by Wednesday, Dec. 15 at 8 a.m. for everything else).

Register for Friday here https://www.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_WXuPsGYCSKeBGf-yu4QW4A

Friday’s meeting starts at 8 a.m. and the morning agenda includes a briefing on the implementation plan to reintroduce anadromous fish into the Klamath Basin. After the Director’s report, commissioners are expected to discuss and vote on the Rogue–South Coast Multi-Species Conservation and Management Plan (RSP). No further verbal public testimony about the Plan will be accepted on Friday. 

The Commission is also expected to adopt regulations for the 2022 recreational and commercial groundfish fisheries and review the 2020 commercial nearshore logbook report. 

For recreational marine fishing, ODFW staff are recommending a 5-fish marine bag limit in 2022 which should offer stability and reduce the risk of needing to lower the bag limit during the season. Staff are also proposing to prohibit the retention of quillback rockfish, removing it from the one-fish aggregate sub-bag limit to reduce impacts on this species. (This change should have minimal impact as most anglers do not target them.) 

Finally, staff recommend reducing the duration of the 40-fathom depth restriction to two months (July-August) instead of three (June-August). The seasonal depth restriction has been used for many years to protect yelloweye rockfish and this species’ status is improving. 

The Commission will also be asked to:
•	Allow ODFW to provide free daily angling/shellfish licenses to participants of certain organizations who serve Veterans and active military service members, per SB 320 passed by the 2021 Oregon State Legislature. 
•	Allow big game tags to be purchased after the sale deadline online or at license agents via the electronic licensing system. Hunters who do this will still need to attest that they did not hunt before their tag purchase and pay the usual late tag fee of $25.50.
•	Add elk to the urban deer population control program, per SB 761 passed by the 2021 Oregon State Legislature. This will allow cities, when authorized by ODFW, to control elk numbers in urban areas when elk are causing public nuisance, safety concerns and damage to property. Cities who use the program must first pass an ordinance against feeding/placing attractants for elk and meat from any elk is to be donated to a food bank or charitable organization. 
•	Include bighorn sheep tags with other big game tags that can be provided (outside the controlled hunt draw process) to terminally ill children.

A Rule Advisory Committee will meet virtually Nov. 10 to review and discuss proposed changes to administrative rules. The agency intends to create rules to provide the clarity needed for drone pilots, hobbyists and the general public to know where drone take-off and landing is allowed and prohibited within a state park and along the ocean shore.

The committee will also discuss any financial or economic effects of the proposed rules on businesses, local governments or other stakeholders.

The meeting starts at 9 a.m. and is open to the public. Anyone wishing to view the public meeting will need to register via https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_37-oa0iSTDaDu00iUb7_1g

The agenda does not include time for public comment. After the committee review, the rule will open for public comment. Details will be posted on the Proposed OPRD Rules web page.

OPRD appointed members to the Rule Advisory Committee. Members comprise individuals who helped develop the legislation, active visitors to state parks and outdoor recreation professionals.

The permit modification is needed because PGE’s coal-fired power plant closed in October 2020 and because the manufacturer of the facility’s natural gas turbine released new information that startup and shutdown emissions for two pollutants, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds are higher than originally estimated. The proposed permit modification does not change how much natural gas PGE uses or change the hours the plant can run.

The Oregon Department of Revenue (DOR) will be holding a Rule Advisory Committee (RAC) meeting on September 2, 2021. The RAC will help the Department of Revenue in amending these rules to clarify the property tax exemption for property of a religious organization used to provide affordable housing, created by Oregon Laws 2021, Chapter 446. The new law requires the initial-year application to be made to the Department of Revenue but does not specify the process the department is to use, if any, to inform the relevant county nor who should make the initial eligibility determination and on what basis. The RAC will also discuss whether and how parsonages are to be included in the exemption for religious property used for affordable housing. The RAC is an important part of the rule-adoption process and DOR wants to ensure affected taxpayers provide input during the consideration of a possible rule. During the meeting, the RAC will discuss potential rule language. The meeting will be open to the public

It requires the agency to clarify cross-boundary prescribed fire permitting to allow a person to conduct a prescribed fire that burns across land ownership boundaries if the person obtains a permit, complies with its conditions, and obtains consent from relevant landowners. This rulemaking must be complete by November 30, 2022.

SALEM, Ore.—The Fish and Wildlife Commission will consider whether to reclassify the marbled murrelet from Threatened to Endangered under the state’s Endangered Species Act during a meeting Friday, July 9.

The meeting (see agenda) starts at 8 a.m. and will be livestreamed on ODFW’s YouTube channel; watch it from here https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/  

Several guest panelists have been invited to testify during the meeting.

Public testimony will be taken during the meeting. To sign up, register at the following page no later than 48 hours before the meeting (by 8 a.m. Wednesday, July 7), https://www.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_Elu57YXrTtySuJ5-4YWTIw 

Comments can also be emailed to odfw.commission@odfw.oregon.gov 

The Oregon Endangered Species Act sets out criteria and procedural requirements that apply to the Commission’s determination on whether to reclassify a species. To reclassify or uplist the marbled murrelet as Endangered, the Commission must determine that since 1995 (when the species was listed as Threatened), the likelihood of survival of the species has diminished such that the species is in danger of extinction throughout any significant portion of its range within Oregon. The Commission’s decision must be based on documented and verifiable scientific information. 

The Commission must also determine that at least one of the following factors exists: 
1) that most populations are undergoing imminent or active deterioration of their range or primary habitat; or 
2) that overutilization of the species or its habitat for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes is occurring or is likely to occur; or 
3) that existing state or federal programs or regulations are inadequate to protect the species or its habitat. 

Based on these criteria, ODFW staff are recommending that the marbled murrelet remain state-listed as Threatened. ODFW does not believe the likelihood of survival of the species has diminished in Oregon since 1995, such that the species is in danger of extinction. The estimated population of murrelets in Oregon has increased since state listing and the amount of habitat with a higher probability for nesting is likely to continue to increase over time in Oregon with continued implementation of federal and state laws, policies, and programs that protect and enhance habitats across all landownerships. For more details, see the Biological Assessment prepared by staff.  

The Commission may also hold an executive session during the meeting. This executive session is held pursuant to ORS 192.660 (2)(f) to consider information or records that are exempt by law from public inspection, as well as to consult with legal counsel concerning legal rights and duties regarding current litigation likely to be filed as authorized by ORS 192.660 (2)(h). Under Oregon state law, executive sessions are closed to the public. Representatives of the news media are allowed to attend. Reporters are directed not to report on the discussions during executive session, except to state the general subject. No decisions will be made in executive session.

I am pleased to share that we are hosting an informational meeting on the Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) on Thursday, July 1st at 11am. During this call, staff will be available to provide updates on the HAF planning and programming process and receive additional input.
 
To Register for the Zoom Meeting:
https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIkdOuorT0jHtCT7QQMNwkbb8OYhEfjQwOm 
 
Through HAF, Oregon will receive about $90 million to assist homeowners whose pandemic-related financial hardships have caused or increased a risk of mortgage delinquency or foreclosure, displacement, or loss of utilities, energy, or broadband services. Treasury requires OHCS to complete planning and engagement to evaluate the needs of Oregon homeowners. OHCS has listened to its housing partners and several committees and is excited to provide an update on the development of Oregon’s HAF mortgage assistance program.
 
At this meeting OHCS will provide an update on: OHCS’ plans for its initial $9 million in HAF funding; the HAF planning process to date; and the broad strokes of the mortgage reinstatement and assistance program design. In addition to an opportunity for discussion on those points, or to provide written feedback, OHCS hopes to collect feedback on lessons learned from the design and administration of the Hardest Hit Fund programs.
 
We hope you can attend this informational meeting.
 
With Appreciation,

The Employment Department is promulgating permanent rulemaking to adopt OAR 471-031-0310 that will alleviate reimbursing employers from the payment of, and liability for, benefit charges as they relate to UI benefits that were paid to individuals because of identity theft or criminal impersonation per ORS 165.800 and ORS 165.815.​

There has been a massive increase in identity theft and criminal impersonation with unemployment insurance benefits. This fraudulent activity is somewhat anticipated because of the increased availability of benefits programs due to COVID-19. This rule aims to address the growing issue of unemployment insurance fraud and prevent charges to employers for payments due to identity theft or criminal impersonation.

The meeting starts at noon and is open to the public.  Anyone wishing to view the public meeting will need to register via https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_GVHmqTT7ToWIqGs1LQ_GaA.

After the committee review, the rule will open for public comment. Details will be posted on the OPRD Proposed OPRD Rules web page.

The meeting agenda will include discussions about proposed rule changes, including updating defined terms; expanding applicant eligibility to include public educational institutions; raising the minimum federal share on a project; and expanding the organizations from which OPRD can seek nominations for membership to the grant advisory committee. The committee will also discuss any financial or economic effects of the proposed rules on local governments or other applicants.

The Commission will be asked to:

•	Extend the current closure of the recreational abalone fishery for three years as a precaution. Recent surveys show a continued trend toward decline in Oregon’s population of red abalone. Extension of the closure will allow time to monitor habitat conditions and conduct additional underwater surveys to assess changes in the index populations located along the southern Oregon coast.

•	Remove Borax Lake Chub from the state list of threatened and endangered species. Borax Lake chub are a unique minnow found only in Oregon’s Borax Lake and its surrounding wetlands (in the Alvord Desert of Harney County). Threats to their habitat, the primary reason for listing, have been addressed or removed thanks to natural resource agencies and their partners. Borax Lake Chub were downlisted from “endangered” to “threatened” on the State List in April 2017 and formally removed from the Federal ESA list in July 2020.

•	Appoint members to the Commercial Fishery Permit Board. The Board reviews limited entry permit renewal and transfer denials made by ODFW for certain commercial fisheries.

Commissioners will also hear an update on the population status of lower Columbia River white sturgeon and review 2020 sturgeon fisheries.

For a list of projects and brief description of each please visit, https://www.dfw.state.or.us/conservationstrategy/OCRF/docs/OCRF_2nd_round_funding_2021.pdf.
A key aspect of the second round of funding is an increased focus on diversity, equity and inclusion in outdoor recreation programming in Oregon.
In addition to the recently funded projects, the Fish and Wildlife Commission during its Jan. 15 meeting approved a list of future projects contingent on funds becoming available. For a list of projects that need funding visit, https://www.dfw.state.or.us/conservationstrategy/OCRF/docs/OCRAC%20Recommendations%20Contingent%20on%20Future%20Funds%20Updated%20Feb%202021.pdf
Any donations made between now and July 1, 2021 will be dedicated to these diverse and important projects.
""Verde is excited to receive this grant which will support our work towards adapting a COVID safe Club Aves program. We are elated to continue this work to provide safe outdoor recreation opportunities for youth and their families,” Raina Brot-Goldberg, Environmental Educator and Food Access Coordinator for Verde, an OCRF grant recipient 
“Having this long list of incredible conservation and recreation projects demonstrates our commitment to serving Oregon’s diverse interests in fish, wildlife, their habitats and Oregon’s outdoor activities,” said, Dr. Karl Wenner, chair, OCRF advisory committee.
“Every Oregonian can show us that support by contributing to our fund, so that together we can make these projects a reality,” added Wenner.
Anyone interested in learning more can attend the next meeting of the OCRF advisory committee which will be held virtually on Feb. 5, at 10 a.m. Members of the public may attend and comment via https://www.zoomgov.com/j/1608972852.
OCRF is a public-private partnership that has raised more than $250,000 so far and funded eight projects in 2020. Fundraising support for OCRF has come from at least 15,000 individuals who have donated either through ODFW’s Electronic Licensing System or the website, OregonIsAlive.org.
The OCRF was created by the legislature in 2019 and the program sunsets at the end of the current biennium. Continuing to grow this program is a legislative priority for the Department of Fish and Wildlife and is included in the Governor’s omnibus outdoor recreation bill.
OCRF supports projects that implement the Oregon Conservation Strategy and create new opportunities to connect people with the outdoors.

The session will include a presentation by the proposer, the Vietnam War Memorial Fund (http://vietnamwarmemorialfund.org).

To participate in the event, free registration is required at http://bit.ly/oregoncapitolvietnam.

The deadline for comment is January 22, 2021.

The project proposes to install sculptures, plaques, benches, and walkways to memorialize different aspects of the war and military service. It would be just southwest of the World War II memorial, the Parade of Animals play structure, and a gazebo. Nearly all the trees in this area would be incorporated into the proposed design. Three trees would be removed (details online - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jo157kqTKzvUm_QatnDQaZ3Z3NFSEoqJ/view). One part of the memorial honors Gold Star Families (http://hwwmohf.org/monument-overview.html) using a standard design, and the nonprofit has identified three possible locations in the park for its installation. One option would require moving the Parade of Animals to a different part of Willson Park. A Gold Star Family is one that has lost an immediate family member in the line of duty during military service.

A draft plan of the memorial is online (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l2zQGAN1ZsYj8zgOhr_05UoRYnJZzqwP/view) as is a video walkthrough (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWkHHUxORiY).

After collecting public feedback, a committee will submit a report to OPRD Director Lisa Sumption with recommendations. After the Director's review, the Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission could act on the proposal at its February 25, 2021 meeting.

Environmental Quality Dept.,Elder Demolition heath risk assessment ,Join us for a virtual meeting to discuss the Elder Demolition heath risk assessment for your community.,12/08/2020 06:00:00 PM,12/08/2020 08:00:00 PM,Zoom meeting,webinar,OR,"If you are reading this you likely received a postcard in your mailbox. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality's Cleaner Air Oregon program recently completed a health risk assessment on potential air pollution from Elder Demolition, a facility that applied for an air quality permit to place a temporary portable incinerator in your community and future locations across Oregon.

Join us for a virtual meeting to discuss the Elder Demolition heath risk assessment for your community.

A representative from Elder Demolition will join us to provide an overview of their portable incinerator. This is a great opportunity to learn about the facility, review the Cleaner Air Oregon risk assessment results, and ask questions to DEQ and Oregon Health Authority staff.

Elder Demolition Risk Assessment

The Elder Demolition Risk Assessment Results meet Oregon standards that are protective of health. Risk assessments are estimates of people's increased health risk from living near a proposed facility and being exposed to a facility's emissions. These are done before DEQ issues the facility an Air Quality permit to ensure that its emissions will meet health standards.

Questions?

For questions on Cleaner Air Oregon or the Elder Demolition permit application, please contact the DEQ permit writer Weston Li

Fish and Wildlife Department,Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission Meeting ,"The Commission will meet virtually on Friday, Sept. 11 ",09/11/2020 08:00:00 AM,09/11/2020 05:00:00 PM,4034 Fairview Industrial DR SE, Salem,OR,"The Commission will meet virtually on Friday, Sept. 11 to consider crabbing regulations that would reduce the risk of whale entanglement and adopt 2021 Big Game Hunting Regulations.

For the full agenda, see https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/20/09_Sep/index.asp 

The meeting starts at 8 a.m. and will be livestreamed via ODFWs YouTube page; watch the livestream at https://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/

To testify on one of the agenda topics via Zoom, please register no later than 48 hours in advance (by Wednesday, Sept. 9 at 8 a.m.) by submitting this form online https://odfw.wufoo.com/forms/commission-meeting-witness-registration/  

During Friday’s meeting, the Commission will review and consider funding for several projects recommended by the Conservation and Recreational Advisory Committee. The proposed projects implement the Oregon Conservation Strategy and connect people with the outdoors, and would be funded by donations to the Oregon Conservation and Recreation Fund. This is the first round of projects under this new program.

Next, Commissioners will hear recommendations on regulations to reduce the risk of whale entanglements in the Dungeness crab fishery. Commissioners were briefed on this topic in 2019 and in August 2020, and will now consider adopting regulations. Recommendations include reducing commercial pot limits by 20 percent during the late season (after May 1, when there is less participation in the fishery but whales are more likely to be in Oregon waters) and elimination of the two-week gear clean-up period when the commercial season ends in mid-August.  

The Commission will be asked to approve recommendations for funding Access and Habitat projects, which open public hunting access on private land or improve wildlife habitat. They will also be asked to amend the minimum bid for deer and elk auction tags.

The last item on the meeting agenda is adoption of the 2021 Big Game Hunting Regulations, including potential changes to archery deer season in Eastern Oregon and West Cascade elk season. Staff are proposing to change the structure of archery deer hunting in Eastern Oregon from general to controlled seasons. Mule deer populations have declined by nearly 50 percent in the last 40 years and biologists believe having no limits on archery harvest is no longer a responsible management approach. Moving to a controlled season will allow a more targeted approach to harvest and also ensure that any necessary tag reductions in the future are equitable between all hunting opportunities. Archery deer hunting in Western Oregon will continue as a general season opportunity.

ODFW will also propose that West Cascade Elk Any Legal Weapon seasons be moved three weeks later to improve hunt quality, meaning the 2021 season would open the day after general deer season closes and run Nov. 6-12. This change will also eliminate the seven-day break during general deer season in the Cascades. 

After hearing some hunters advocate for the use of crossbows to hunt big game for years, staff is proposing to allow them for hunting big game during “any legal weapon"" seasons for big game (when rifles, bows, handguns, and other weapons are also allowed). Crossbows would remain prohibited for all hunters during archery seasons.
