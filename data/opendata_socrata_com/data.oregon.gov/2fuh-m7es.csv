Public Utility Commission,"Public Meeting - Notice of Agenda Change for August 2, 2016 Regular Public Meeting.","NOTICE IS GIVEN that PacifiCorp’s Update to its Schedule 37 - Qualifying Facilities Avoided Cost Payments – is being removed from the agenda of the Commission’s August 2, 2016 Regular Public Meeting.   While engaged in private practice, Chair Hardie provided legal advice to PacifiCorp after the company had developed and filed these avoided cost prices.  Although Chair Hardie’s advice was extremely limited and primarily procedural in nature, she has decided to participate in this matter only to the extent required to reach a quorum for Commission decision.  Chair Hardie’s decision to limit her participation is not legally required, but taken out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of fair and open proceedings.  Because Commissioner Savage will be out of the office and not available to participate in the August 2, 2016 Regular Public Meeting,  PacifiCorp’s Schedule 37 update will be rescheduled to be heard at a later date.",08/02/2016 09:30:00 AM,08/02/2016 12:00:00 PM,"201 High Street SE, Hearing Room",Salem,OR,,,Kristi Collins,503-373-0885,kristi.collins@state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
