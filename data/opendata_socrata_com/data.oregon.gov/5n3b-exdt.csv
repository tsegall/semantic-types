Wall Street ,Bend,OR,"Members of the Attorney General's Public Records Law Reform Task Force will be accepting public comments on the Oregon Public Records Law, and the work of the task force. Please join us to share your experiences, suggestions, or other thoughts with task force members.

All are welcome to attend.

Information about the work of the task force is available on the Public Records Law Reform Task Force website. Currently, that work is focused primarily on the hundreds of disclosure exemptions that keep information out of public hands - and can make the law difficult to implement. Other issues that the task force expects to examine include the cost and timeliness of public records disclosures. The task force wants to hear from Oregonians on these and other public records law subjects.

Fish and Wildlife Department,Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission Meeting,"The Fish and Wildlife commission will meet Friday, Aug. 5 at the ODFW Headquarters in Salem to adopt 2017 sportfishing and 2016 coastal coho regulations, as well as mule deer and elk management objectives.  The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at ODFW, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem. The meeting agenda is at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/16/08_august/index.asp",08/05/2016 08:00:00 AM,08/05/2016 05:00:00 PM,4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem,OR,"The Fish and Wildlife commission will meet Friday, Aug. 5 at the ODFW Headquarters in Salem to adopt 2017 sportfishing and 2016 coastal coho regulations, as well as mule deer and elk management objectives.

The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at ODFW, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem. The meeting agenda is at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/16/08_august/index.asp

In the morning during the Director’s Report, the Chair of the Joint Interim Task Force On Funding for Fish, Wildlife, and Related Outdoor Recreation and Education will give a status update on their work to date. The Task Force was created by HB 2402 to develop recommendations to strengthen the State’s ability to conserve natural resources and connect the diversity of Oregonians to nature through outdoor recreation and education.

Also during the Director’s Report, ODFW staff will provide informational updates on the Wolf Management Plan Review process, recent stakeholder meetings and a revised schedule for the Wolf Plan review. There will be no public testimony during this briefing.

The Commission will also be asked to adopt 2017 sportfishing regulations. The majority of the changes being proposed are housekeeping corrections building on last year’s effort to simplify the regulations. A few more significant proposed changes are:

The portion of the Lower Deschutes River River that borders the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation will be open April 22-Dec. 31 (reverting back to regulations in effect prior to 2016).
Multiple Lower Columbia tributaries will only be open to the harvest of hatchery salmon to protect wild tule fall Chinook. The majority of salmon in these areas are hatchery fish so this change is expected to have minimal impact on fishing opportunities but will provide necessary protections for listed wild fish.
New regulations and an updated map to more clearly designate the fishing areas in Herman Creek located in the Columbia River Zone.
Additionally, the Commission will be asked to approve several Restoration and Enhancement Projects and appoint Rod Moore to the board as the Seafood Processor Representative. R and E funds projects that enhance fish production and provide more public access to fishing waters.

The Commission will be asked to adopt wild coastal coho fishing regulations. ODFW staff are proposing limited fishing this year due to a low expected return. Fishing would be allowed in the Umpqua, Coos, Coquille Rivers and Tenmile Lakes, with Siltcoos and Tahkenitch lakes open under permanent regulations.

Finally, the Commission will consider mule deer and elk management objectives (MOs) which ODFW reviews periodically. Many of Oregon’s 67 wildlife management units have a winter population MO (the number of mule deer or elk desired in the unit during the winter) and a buck and bull ratio MO (the ratio of buck mule deer or bull elk observed per 100 females after the hunting season).

MOs are not the maximum number of animals a unit can support, but a compromise to maintain deer and elk numbers at levels compatible with primary land uses, limit damage to private property while maximizing recreational benefits (hunting and wildlife viewing).

Public testimony for topics not on the agenda will be held first thing Friday morning, just after the adoption of temporary rules. Persons seeking to testify on issues not on the formal agenda may do so by making arrangements with the ODFW Director’s Office, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, by calling 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044.

Reasonable accommodations will be provided as needed for individuals requesting assistive hearing devices, sign language interpreters or large-print materials. Individuals needing these types of accommodations may call the ODFW Director’s Office at 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044 at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting.

The Commission is the policy-making body for fish and wildlife issues in the state and it usually meets monthly.",yes,Michelle Dennehy,(503) 931-2748,Michelle.N.Dennehy@state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While engaged in private practice, Chair Hardie provided legal advice to PacifiCorp after the company had developed and filed these avoided cost prices.  Although Chair Hardie’s advice was extremely limited and primarily procedural in nature, she has decided to participate in this matter only to the extent required to reach a quorum for Commission decision.  Chair Hardie’s decision to limit her participation is not legally required, but taken out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of fair and open proceedings.  Because Commissioner Savage will be out of the office and not available to participate in the August 2, 2016 Regular Public Meeting,  PacifiCorp’s Schedule 37 update will be rescheduled to be heard at a later date.",08/02/2016 09:30:00 AM,08/02/2016 12:00:00 PM,"201 High Street SE, Hearing Room",Salem,OR,,,Kristi Collins,503-373-0885,kristi.collins@state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PM Agenda 08022016.docx (https://data.oregon.gov/views/gs36-7t8m/files/8a7599fb-7844-4347-8f8a-096a24a7bc7a?download=true&filename=PM%20Agenda%2008022016.docx),,,
