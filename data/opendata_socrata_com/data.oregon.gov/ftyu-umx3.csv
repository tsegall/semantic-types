Joel,Schipper,Jsrr195@gmail.com,Self,Oregon,This seems perfectly reasonable.  Hard to believe the cost of an inspection is as LOW as proposed; are you sure it shouldn’t be higher to cover the full cost of the DEQ vehicle inspection operations?,
Dave,Ganslein,daveganslein@hotmail.com,Outcasts Car Club,Oregon,I oppose all proposed fee increases or or any future enhancements to vehicle inspections,
William,Erickson,bill@ericksonsautomotive.com,Erickson's Automotive,OR,"I am wonding with the implementation of DEQTOO why would they need the same staffing levels? I recommend waiting 12 months and analyze the DEQTOO data before making any decisions. There is no common sense reason the raise rates to keep 8 people employed with no work to do. The DEQTOO has just rolled out to the general public, it will actually take 2 years before everyone has received a renewal to even know that shops like mine do the work DEQ staff was doing, and I am doing it for free to our customers.",
M,H,,,OR,"I agree with the previous comment wondering why you need a fee increase when DEQTOO costs you less work - not more. Among the several laws you list in your public notice package, one requires you to set fee amounts based upon your costs. So just like you currently charge an extra $5 for costing you more staff time to test at a dealership – you should be charging at least $5 less for a DEQTOO test since that costs you much less staff time. This logic seems consistent with how you’re getting rid of Medford’s 50% discount now that their test procedure no longer costs less than Portland’s once did. It’s also consistent with your $15 discount for businesses that self test their fleet of vehicles. So if you are going to adjust any of your certificate fees on July 1, then DEQTOO tests should get a discount between $5 and $15. There’s no reason to wait additional time to analyze data since there are already over 140 businesses involved - some for over 24 months.",
Sunwen,Chou,chous@ohsu.edu,Oregon Health & Science University,Oregon,"The only proposed program update is a fee increase for no additional protection of air quality. The idea that DEQ is owed a fee increase because there has been none since 1997 is a deception that will encourage long time residents to flee the state (consider the recent vehicle inspection rule changes in WA state). In 1997 the inspection fee was quadrupled on the grounds of enhanced dynamometer testing facilties, which were discontinued 10 years later with no compensatory fee reduction. Instead of a fee increase, the scope of testing of vehicles should be narrowed to exclude more of the recent model years unlikely to be polluting, and very old model years (>20) that are unlikely to be driven much. Instead, DEQ should consider increasing enforcement of diesel particulate emissions from old commercial vehicles, such as old FedEx and UPS vehicles, where a single vehicle can emit 50 to 100 times the amount of particulate pollution over a modern vehicle. The focus of the DEQ VIP on carbon monoxide from light vehicles is outdated.",
