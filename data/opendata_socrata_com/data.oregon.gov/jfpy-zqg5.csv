Scott,Braunsten,scott.braunsten@pbsusa.com,PBS Engineering and Environmental,Oregon,"•	Comment for 340-150-0180 in general, suggest including something on what to do when groundwater is encountered, such as specified in 340-122. This includes where to collect samples and what analyses are required.",
Scott,Braunsten,scott.braunsten@pbsusa.com,PBS Engineering and Environmental,Oregon,"Comment regarding 340-150-0180 (5)(b), suggest addressing in-place closure when groundwater is encountered. Current text requires four samples collected beneath the tank, regardless of the presence or absence of groundwater.  Soil samples collected beneath the water table may not represent site conditions for petroleum-containing USTs and could give erroneous results.",
Scott,Braunsten,scott.braunsten@pbsusa.com,PBS Engineering and Environmental,Oregon,"Comment regarding 340-150-0010: suggest modifying definition of “confirmed release” to include a comment that, when groundwater is not encountered, a confirmed release is a detection above Soil Matrix level 1 cleanup standards.  It is burdensome for DEQ and tank owners to have to file a release, submit forms, and have DEQ oversight for simple sites where closure is guaranteed.",
