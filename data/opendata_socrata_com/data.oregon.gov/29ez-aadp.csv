The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan.,06/18/2018 06:30:00 PM,06/18/2018 08:30:00 PM,Hood River Inn 1108 E Marina Drive, Hood River,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan.,06/19/2018 12:00:00 PM,06/19/2018 02:00:00 PM,Eastern Oregon Trade and Event Center 1750 E Airport Road, Hermiston,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

Where: Portland State Office Building, 800 NE Oregon St., Room 1A, Portland. Conference line: 888-273-3658, participant code 76-64-09
Agenda: Review background information; brief overview of the rulemaking process; review draft amended rules; next steps.
Background: Senate Bill 738, passed by the Oregon State Legislature in 2011, allows the Oregon Health Authority to approve dental pilot projects once an application has been approved. These projects are intended to evaluate the quality of care, access, cost, workforce, and efficacy by teaching new skills to existing categories of dental personnel; developing new categories of dental personnel; accelerating the training of existing categories of dental personnel; or teaching new oral health care roles to previously untrained persons.
The Oral Health Program at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division is holding a series of rules advisory committee (RAC) meetings to discuss amendments to rules related to dental pilot projects.
The purpose of the RAC is to provide feedback and input on the development of amended rule language, as well as review the statement of need and fiscal impact for the proposed rules.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/26/2018 12:30:00 PM,06/26/2018 02:30:00 PM,http://www.oregon.gov/oha/OHPB/Pages/CCO-2-0.aspx, Corvallis,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/28/2018 12:30:00 PM,06/28/2018 02:30:00 PM,Henley Elementary School 8227 Highway 39, Klamath Falls,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/27/2018 11:00:00 AM,06/27/2018 01:00:00 PM,Astoria Armory 1636 Exchange Street, Astoria,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/19/2018 06:30:00 PM,06/19/2018 08:30:00 PM,"Treasure Valley Community College, Weese Building, Room 110 650 College Blvd", Ontario,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

The approval preserves more than two decades of work that have gone into building and improving the Oregon Health Plan.

As part of its regular public meeting, the Medicaid Advisory Committee and the Oregon Health Authority will offer Oregonians an opportunity to provide input on the waiver’s progress and how we can continue to move forward together toward a healthier Oregon. Oregon Health Plan members and the general public are invited to attend in person or participate online via the webinar.

OHA will accept public feedback in a variety of ways for this meeting:
1.	In-person testimony during the public forum session at the Medicaid Advisory Committee meeting
2.	Oral testimony via webinar during the public forum session at the Medicaid Advisory Committee meeting
3.	Written testimony submission from June 28 to July 28, 2017. Details for submitting written testimony will be provided separately. 

When available, a recording of the forum will be posted on the Medicaid 1115 waiver webpage at http://www.oregon.gov/oha/hpa/Medicaid-1115-Waiver/pages/index.aspx and the Medicaid Advisory Committee page at https://www.oregon.gov/oha/OHPR/MAC/Pages/index.aspx.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/26/2018 06:00:00 PM,06/26/2018 08:00:00 PM,Holiday Inn 919 Kruse Way, Springfield,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

About CCO 2.0
The end of the first five-year contracts with CCOs marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid). Since 2012, Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, reduced unnecessary emergency department visits, and improved preventive care for children and adults.
 
The policy options focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:
•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.
Although HIT is not called out specifically in the Governor’s priority improvement areas, HIT components, such as supporting providers’ electronic health records and ability to exchange health information to coordinate care, are foundational for these improvements to be successful.  Today’s CCOs are supporting HIT components in several ways—OHA’s HIT policy options for CCO 2.0 build on these efforts and increase expectations for CCOs to ensure that the Governor’s priorities can be effectively achieved.
 
OHA will gather public input on the policy options, including the HIT policy options, throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.
