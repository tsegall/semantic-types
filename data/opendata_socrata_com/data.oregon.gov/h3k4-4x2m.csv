"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Oregon Reproductive Health Program,,09/22/2022 11:00:00 AM,09/22/2022 11:00:00 AM,Remotely via Microsoft Teams,Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Public Health Division is proposing to permanently amend Oregon Administrative Rules in chapter 333, division 004 related to the Oregon Reproductive Health Program.

In July 2019, the Oregon Reproductive Health (RH) Program withdrew from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Title X program as a result of new restrictive federal rules that contradicted state law. In the absence of Title X funds and in order to maintain the provision of essential reproductive health services, the RH Program utilized an alternative source of funding, Oregon Reproductive Health Program General Funds, or RH GF, to reimburse certified agencies for clinical services. Under the Biden administration, HHS removed the restrictive rules from Title X and the RH Program submitted an application to rejoin Title X. On March 30, 2022, the RH Program received a notice of grant award and intends to resume use of Title X funds to reimburse for clinical services starting May 1, 2022. Replacing RH GF with federal Title X funds will allow the RH Program to conserve state general funds. Temporary rules to reflect this change were filed on May 1, 2022 (Temporary Administrative Order PH 50-2022). The RH Program now seeks to make these temporary rules permanent. 

Additionally, the RH Program has revised the RHCare Certification Requirements, which are incorporated by reference in the OARs, to ensure realignment with Title X requirements. The RH Program has also made minor revisions to the CCare Certification Requirements and updated the AbortionCare Certification Requirements to match the organizational structure of the RHCare and CCare Certification Requirements. 

Finally, the RH Program inserted language to increase client and provider protections in response to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Supreme Court decision and the subsequent changing legal landscape regarding abortion services across states. 

You are being invited to review these proposed rules and to comment on them. If you wish to present oral testimony, a public hearing will be held remotely by video/phone conference call via Microsoft Teams on September 22, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. To provide oral testimony during this hearing, please contact publichealth.rules@odhsoha.oregon.gov to receive the link for the Microsoft Teams video conference.

To testify on an agenda item remotely, register at least 48 hours in advance (by Wednesday,  Aug. 3 at 8 a.m.) at this link 

To testify in-person, sign up on the day of the meeting at ODFW HQ. Sign- up sheets are available outside the Commission room.

Comments can also be emailed to odfw.commission@odfw.oregon.gov

A public forum for people to comment on topics not on the agenda is scheduled for Friday morning after the Director's report. To participate in the public forum, contact the ODFW Director's office at (503) 947-6044 or email  ODFW.Commission@odfw.oregon.gov  by Wednesday, Aug. 3 at 8 a.m. (48 hours prior to the meeting).

The following business is on the Commission’s agenda: 
Role of ODFW lands for marbled murrelet conservation: Per the Oregon Endangered Species Act (OESA), the Commission will determine the role ODFW-owned lands will play in marbled murrelet conservation. Where feasible, forested habitat on ODFW lands would be managed to contribute to their conservation and all relevant ODFW lands will continue to implement the survival guidelines for the marbled murrelet. Staff will also provide an update on the determinations of roles by other state land owning and managing agencies per OESA requirements.

Fall Chinook conservation hatchery program for the Coquille River: The number of naturally-produced adult fall Chinook salmon returning to the Coquille River basin has been severely depressed since 2018 and the population is at high risk of extirpation. In coordination with the Coquille Indian Tribe, ODFW is proposing to initiate a Conservation Hatchery Program as an emergency measure to boost natural production and provide time to address the limiting factors which include predation by non-native fish.
Interim hatchery measures are needed to ensure the genetic legacy of the population is preserved and that there are sufficient adults returning to avoid extirpation before other recovery actions can be completed.

Adopt 2023 Sport Fishing Regulations: The few changes proposed to next year’s fishing regulations include moving to catch-and-release only for wild rainbow trout in the Fall River to help conserve wild populations. A change in zone regulations to standardize bass fishing regulations in streams (lifting size and number limits) will both simplify regulations by removing a number of redundant special regulations and help conserve native species where they overlap with bass populations. See the complete list of proposals online.

Other changes to sport fishing regulations already adopted by the Commission and the Oregon State Legislature will also be included in the rule adoption, including the Rogue-South Coast Plan, changes to license offerings and changes to bag limits for green crab.   

ODFW staff will also brief the Commission on activities related to beaver management in Oregon and provide an update on implementation of the Private Forest Accord passed by the 2022 Oregon State Legislature.

"Health Authority, Oregon","Administrative rulemaking hearing - OAR 333-019-0010, 1005 - COVID-19: elimination of some exclusions from schools, childcare and youth programs",,07/20/2022 11:00:00 AM,07/20/2022 11:00:00 AM,Remotely via Microsoft Teams,Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority (Authority), Public Health Division is proposing to permanently amend Oregon Administrative Rules in chapter 333, division 19 to eliminate some exclusions from schools, childcare and youth programs following exposure to COVID-19.

OAR 333-019-0010 is a rule concerning school, childcare, and worksite restrictions for individuals who have certain diseases or who are susceptible and exposed to certain diseases. The rule is being amended to eliminate exclusion of students and staff in schools and children’s facilities because of exposure to COVID-19; the requirement to exclude persons with COVID-19 will remain. Definitions no longer needed are also eliminated.

OAR 333-019-1005 sets out public health and safety requirements for childcare providers and youth programs and defines terms used in this rule. The rule is being amended to eliminate exclusion of childcare providers and children, and staff in youth programs because of exposure to COVID-19; the requirement to exclude persons with COVID-19 will remain. Definitions related to these changes that are no longer needed are being eliminated, as are requirements to inform individuals not to enter the childcare or youth program if they are unvaccinated and have been exposed to COVID-19; and to notify and coordinate with local public health authorities if there has been a case of COVID-19 in someone on the premises.

You are being invited to review and comment on the proposed rules. If you wish to present oral testimony, a public hearing will be held remotely by video or teleconference via Microsoft Teams on July 20, 2022 at 11:00 A.M.
