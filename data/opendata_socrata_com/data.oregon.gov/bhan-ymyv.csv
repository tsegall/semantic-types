The meeting will occur at the Salem Municipal Airport Terminal building located at 2990 25th Street SE, Salem in the conference room. The agenda is available at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/STEP.  The meeting will begin at 8:00 a.m. and proceed through the agenda, which includes STEP program planning, review of mini-grant applications, and review of two STEP Project proposals. The meeting is open to the public.

The Committee will review one project proposal that would like to implement a wild broodstock program on the North Fork Nehalem River to improve angling opportunities and one propagation proposal for rearing winter steelhead at the Siletz Tribal Hatchery for release into Little Rock Creek.

Any STEP project that rears fish for release (including egg incubation) must be approved by ODFW. Part of the approval process includes public input and review by the Advisory Committee. The proposals are available for public review on the ODFW website at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/STEP/  Members of the public will be able to comment on the proposals at the meeting or in writing.  Written responses must submitted to ODFW and be received by December 2.

The Oregon Legislature created Salmon and Trout Enhancement Program in 1981 to provide a way for volunteers to participate in the restoration of native stocks of salmon, steelhead and trout. The STEP Advisory Committee makes recommendations to ODFW and the Fish and Wildlife Commission on issues regarding its programs. The committee’s 13 members are appointed by the Governor and represent all areas of Oregon.

Reasonable accommodations will be provided as needed for individuals requesting assistive hearing devices, sign language interpreters or large-print materials. Individuals needing these types of accommodations may call the Information and Education Division at (800) 720-6339 or (503) 947-6002 at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting. 

For more information on the Salmon Trout Enhancement Program visit the ODFW Web site at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/STEP/ or call program staff at (503) 947-6201.

The Commission will be asked to adopt Oregon’s Conservation Plan for Lampreys, which was developed through coordination with various stakeholders and partners. Interest in lamprey conservation has increased dramatically over the last two decades as concern has grown over their status. The Plan covers four of the state’s native species of lampreys: Pacific Lamprey, Western River Lamprey, Western Brook Lamprey, and Pacific Brook Lamprey and identifies limiting factors, management strategies and research needed to conserve these species.

2020 groundfish regulations (e.g. rockfish, lingcod, cabezon, greenling) are also on the agenda. State harvest guidelines are very similar to last year and ODFW staff are proposing a similar recreational season as last year, with a 5-fish daily bag limit. A new sub-bag daily limit of 1 copper, quillback or China rockfish is also being recommended, as the harvest guideline for these species was met early in 2019 and ended retention in late August. Fishing would be limited to shoreward of the 40-fathom line from June through August, and allowed at all depths from September through May. Commercial nearshore fishery landing limits will also be similar to 2019. Changes to the commercial Black Rockfish Management Areas, which have additional daily limits for black rockfish landings in the commercial fishery, will be considered.

Other topics on the meeting agenda include:

Amending roadkill salvage rules to allow deer and elk dispatched by wildlife law enforcement personnel after being roadstruck to be salvaged by people besides just the driver.
Making corrections to minor errors in the big game controlled hunt tables and boundary descriptions from the September Commission meeting to accurately reflect the newly published 2020 Regulations.
Formally approve the amended trapping regulations to prohibit the use of traps or snares suspended in trees in the Siskiyou and Siuslaw National Forests and prohibit trapping in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, per previous Commission decision and reflected in temporary rule.
Consider funding for several Restoration and Enhancement projects to increase fishing opportunities or improve public access and approve some housekeeping updates for rules managing the program.
A public forum will be held Friday morning after the Director’s report for people who wish to testify about an issue not on the formal meeting agenda. Call the ODFW Director’s office at least 48 hours before the meeting at (503) 947-6044 to schedule.

On Nov. 7, the Commission received a petition to prohibit wild winter steelhead retention in the SW Zone. Formal consideration of the petition must occur within 90 days of receipt and is scheduled for the Jan. 17, 2020 Commission meeting in Salem. Several of the petitioners have signed up to speak to the Commission during the Dec. 6 public forum to advocate for a temporary rule prohibiting wild winter steelhead harvest in the SW Zone for the 2020 season.
