Shawn,Dolqan,sdolan50@msn.com,Sustainable Skys,,I read the monitoring for the control device installed annually but I do not read the monitoring of the visible emissions for the facilities.  Is this rule subject to another rule that regulates visible emissions from the furnaces?  ,
Melody,Roth,mroth97@msn.com,,OR,"I am a full-time health professional and part-time glass artist from Portland, OR. I work in a studio that is owned by a sole proprietor who provides classes, open studio time, equipment and that produces architectural glass pieces for sale to retailers across the U.S.

I have been interested in glass for many years, but it took a health scare experience for me to really begin creating with glass. I ground myself with focus on the color, the feel and the activity. It is a wonderful stress reducer and an opportunity to help by giving gifts of glass to support others during their difficult times. If the studio that I work in is unable to survive, I and many others will have no place to work.

I live in SE Portland, OR where Bullseye has been under scrutiny for emitting heavy metals from their exhaust stacks during glass production. In an industrial area where there is an intermodal train yard and diesel truck exhaust, a cement company and many other industries tucked in between neighborhoods, we would expect to see  these metals. Uroboros, another Portland-based glass producer is in an industrial area between two freeways that carry a high load of truck traffic, is close to train tracks and a switching yard. Did you know that diesel exhaust produces chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel and many more chemicals that are dangerous to our health?

The Governor of Oregon issued a Cease & Desist order twice to Bullseye without specifically identifying the source of emission. DEQ, Oregon Health Authority, EPA and our elected officials across the country seem to be pointing to the production at Bullseye as the definitive culprit. Fused art glass is limited in production in the US to 6 small manufacturers. Many are in industrial areas where they belong. However, this does make it challenging to identify the real sources of toxins to more accurately deal with the air quality issue.

We all want cleaner air. We all want a thriving economy and jobs. While Bullseye employs about 125 people, many thousands of people depend on their success worldwide to support their families and to pay taxes. They export about 35% of their production. They are a strong contributor to our community both in special projects and income. Bullseye attracts tourism revenue in many of our service sectors due to classes, tours and retail sales of products. 

Bullseye is at present adding baghouses to their furnaces that will allow them to produce glass with 99.9% filtration rate. It is difficult to meet the deadlines for installation when nearly 80% of production had been shut down for a period of time, and at present are strictly limited, with limited impact on air quality.

As recent air monitoring data has shown, there has been little change in air quality since Bullseye has been limited in their production. That points to a stronger likelihood of other bigger contributors in the neighborhood. Please use objective scientific methods and data and consult with glass professionals for advice in making sound decisions when developing pollution control solutions for the glass art industry. Please be fair in application of rules to art glass manufacturers. Please consider the impact on jobs, tax revenues, and the limited win on pollution control when applying subjective and stringent rules on the glass industry with short notification in relationship to the environments they operate in. This effort has a huge financial impact and may well cause production to shift overseas. Sending production to China will not clean our air. It will not support the Oregonians who work in the art glass industry, nor any of those across our continent and the rest of the world. It will not provide any tax revenues. 

Thank you for your time. Please consider using scientific data to have a real impact on our health and air quality, on art and our economy as changes are made in environmental regulations.

Sincerely,
Melody Roth",
Susan,Zarit,slzarit@msn.com,Mind and Soul Art ,Washington,"Mr. Westersund,

You had asked for people to comment about the fiscal impact of the permanent ruling on the glass industry. However, it has come to my attention that, perhaps, you may be disregarding those of us that are outside the State of Oregon. I do hope I am misinformed. As I had stated in my previous comment, Bullseye Glass Co. is not an island unto itself. It is an integral part of a much larger community...a community of thousands of people to be somewhat exact. Therefore, the decisions you, the DEQ and the EPA, make have a very far reaching effect. Therefore, Mr. Westersund, statements from people outside of Oregon are just as valid as those from within because Oregon is not an island unto itself either.

Now, having said all of that, I am the owner of Mind and Soul Art. I do not make money as I donate my art work to various charities for auctions and other fundraisers. Actually, I helped Eugene's Relay for Life. They have been the largest fundraiser's for that organization. Did you know that? I also help organizations within my own State of Washington: Mosaic, The Answer for Youth, My choices, local animal shelters, etc. I help nation/international organizations: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Walk in My Shoes, American Cancer Society, Autism Speaks, etc. My point in listing some these organizations is to point out that the financial impact is not only about making a living, supporting a family, supporting employees. It is all of those and more.

If you would like some examples of how ""out-of-Staters"" have a more direct fiscal impact in this matter, please allow me to give you a few examples. I was just recently in Portland for a 5-day education class at Bullseye. Now, I came down a day early, so that's 6 days at a hotel. I stayed at the Oxford Inn & Suites at Jantzen Beach because I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there from the last time I was in town for a Bullseye education class. While in town, I had to purchase food. I also needed to purchase other items I forgot to pack. like a good pair of sturdy shoes. Now, my family joined me during my stay. While I was in class, they were out sightseeing and spending tourism dollars. Now, I was not the only ""out-of-Stater"" at this class. Bullseye has a large selection of education classes. This draws in many people who spend money in your State.

Please consider all sides of this discussion when making your decision. We all want clean air. I don't want to see what happened to Spectrum Glass (Woodinville,WA) happen to Bullseye or any other glass company.",
Leora,Druckman,leorad@aol.com,na,Michigan,"*Why closing Bullseye could mean the death of an international industry.*

I make glass art, not for a living, but simply because I love it. But, I respect the many tens of thousands of people around the globe who depend on art glass for their living.   This includes talented artists who make beautiful works of art by cutting, melting, shaping, casting and blowing this amazing material.   It includes the galleries that sell these works of art; the many wholesale and retail businesses that sell glass tools and materials; the instructors who make their living teaching this ancient craft; the manufacturers of kilns, glass tools, enamels and other additives; and, of course, those who make art glass - the specialty glass required for almost all of today's modern glass crafts.   Bullseye is, by far, the primary producer of art glass in the world.  Without Bullseye, the art glass industry may cease to exist. 

But how can a single producer in an industry this large have such a huge impact?  Aren't there other colored glass producers in the world?

Yes, other companies produce colored glass, but only a few produce colored glass that can actually be used in creating art glass. There are a few producers of colored glass who make glass primarily used to create stained glass, but the glass they make can not be used when creating blown, kiln melted, lampworked or cast glass art.  All of which combine multiple colors of glass under high heat and constitute the vast majority of glass art today. 

There are only a few companies that make glass that can be used in this way.  The largest and most experienced is Bullseye.  Bullseye is the only major producer of a full color range of 90 COE (coefficient of expansion) glass. Most glass artists use either 90 COE or 96 COE glass.  In fact, many restrict their studios to one or the other.  Why?  While two pieces of colored art glass may look exactly alike, when pieces of COE 90 and COE 96 are combined though heat, hours or even months of work can be destroyed.   Glasses with different COEs pull away from each other in heat, causing cracks, warping, breaking and often, one big mess.   

Bullseye created and perfected the manufacturing processes  and technology for producing glass that is COE compatible across an entire product line.  Before Bullseye did this, most of the magnificent glass art you see today would not have been possible.   Because of their vast selection, rigorous 90 COE testing, high quality and excellent (and very generous) production of educational materials, most in the art glass business primarily stock and use Bullseye glass.  The only other major competition comes from producers of COE 96 colored art glass.  COE 96 glass  is produced almost exclusively by two businesses, Spectrum glass (which just announced that they are going out of business) and Uroboros.   The 90 COE and 96 COE glass manufacturers have provided healthy competition with each other in an industry with few competitors.   The majority of the rest of the glass produced in the world is of uncertain and/or inconsistent COE and therefore unusable for making most art glass. 

Usually, businesses do not rely primarily on one supplier for their business needs.  Because of the difficulty of producing quality, COE compatible glass, the art glass industry is different.   Bullseye is the only major producer of COE 90 compatible glass.  Even if everyone in the art glass business attempted to switch to COE 96 glass, many businesses would go under due to the cost of switching all their glass and supporting materials. The art glass industry (like many businesses) is still recovering from the recent recession. Also, due to the death of Spectrum, it is unlikely that enough COE 96 glass in the needed range of colors will be available as soon as it would be needed.  And, if Uroboros receives the same treatment as Bullseye, it may end up out of business like its sister Spectrum.  

Please consider this unique and valuable international industry when making decisions involving Bullseye.  Clearly, the company is showing a willingness to improve their impact on the environment as they have already started implementing filtering systems and have offered a plan for reduced emissions.  Consider giving time for the company to adjust so it can continue to survive while making these important decisions.   And, be very, very sure that the data you are using to make these decisions is accurate and actually leads to any conclusions you decide to make before you destroy a entire industry.

Terri,Johanson,Terrijohanson@terrijohansonartglass.com,"Terri Johanson Art Glass, member of the Oregon Glass Guild Gorge Chapter",Washington,"I am a glass artist in the Columbia River Gorge and although I currently live in Washington I was a long-time Oregon resident. I have experience with state rule-making and I understand the pressures exerted by the passions of diverse stakeholders. I urge that the process resist rules responding to hypothetical and/or ""what if"" ideas that may be presented; but rather that the standards be set to align with scientific evidence of toxicity levels and the rules should include procedures for continued monitoring and response processes.

I have extensive experience working with the 2 glass manufacturers in Portland. I know them to be responsible and responsive business people. In addition to their desire to produce the glass products that we use for our art and to make a reasonable profit, they are also people who want to be sure that they are keeping their employees, customers and communities safe and healthy. The rule-making that is currently in process MUST place equal responsibility on those who monitor and regulate the environmental impacts of manufacturing as on the manufacturers. The rules must require consistent and immediate communication with manufacturers to initiate a collaborative problem-solving process to address any real or perceived problem. Also reasonable time frames must be established for initiating or installing any equipment or process to resolve such problems. Without a positive and reasonable regulatory and monitoring process in place both industry (not just the glass industry) and the regulatory agencies that carry public responsibility for setting and monitoring the standards are vulnerable to media generated hysteria that can result in unreasoned and unfair responses. Industry cannot respond to issues that emerge beyond the existing requirements and/or without appropriate notification and problem-solving efforts between the regulators and the industry representatives. Public fear is a dynamic and powerful force which can cause undo harm to all concerned...to people who are, or imagine that they are, or may be, harmed; to regulators caught without appropriate standards grounded in real science; and to the industries impacted by the rules and the standards. The rules must set not only standards, but also a proactive ongoing process that supports a healthy environment for both the population and the industries impacted.

It is highly unlikely that the recent environmental uproar in Portland was due to emissions from just the glass manufactures but also to others in the complex industrial environment that exists in the urban area. Therefore whatever rules emerge from this effort must be applied across the industrial entities that may be using the chemicals involved in these rules...and that the rules govern responsible operations of both the industry and the regulatory agencies involved.

The rules must also include requirements for regular review and amendments of the rules to  respond to ungoing research and analysis of the environmental impacts of issues governed by the rules. Science has consistently shown that what is known or thought to be known is often revealed to be erroneous and/or misguided in light of new research and emerging knowledge.

This rule-making effort is serious business. The impacts are far-reaching. There are significant economic impacts not just on the glass industry and on the art world and artists who depend on its products, but also on the employees of the industry, the retailers who serve the art community and the economy of the communities involved. 

The health impacts of these rules must also be evaluated in light of grounded research of the potential for and/or existing demonstration of harm. Fear, supposition and imagined or media hyped harm should not influence or guide the rule making process.

Charity,Heroux,Gotdichro@yahoo.com,SOURGiRL glass art,California,"Hello,

I have been working with glass for the last fifteen years. Wow, to see it in print like that is amazing. I feel so fortunate to have found the art form that makes me whole. From the minute I saw dichroic glass, I was hooked. I have been madly in love ever since. 

I started out small, making things for myself and gifts for others, but with hard work and sacrifice (so much sacrifice) I have built a business and a name I am very proud of. I was born to make this art, and I cannot do it without companies like Bullseye and Uroboros.

Over the last several months the Art Glass industry has been under fire for emissions that the companies were unaware of. As soon as they found out they were emitting the toxins they voluntarilyÂ  stopped production and manufacturing using any of the compounds in question until they are able to install filtration on their furnaces. The Office of the Governor and the DEQ have made it very difficult for these companies to continue working while they try to come up to code with the new and swiftly changingÂ  regulations, but Bullseye and Uroboros have worked very hard to comply. The Cease and Desist issued by the Governor all but crippled Bullseye, prohibiting them from raising any capital to meet the new filtration requirements.Â But still, they have persevered. 
They believe in this industry. They believe that this art form must survive.

I believe Bullseye glass when they say they want to comply with the new standards. I have known and worked with these people for fifteen years, they are truly GOOD people. I believe they want to make their facility as clean as they possibly can. They just need your help to do it.

What I am asking for is your help to keep this American industry alive. There are no known facilities that produce the glass these companies make outside of the USA. This does not just affect fused glass but stained, flameworked, and blown glass as well. The agrument here is not against the new regs, it is against the timeline and restrictions in which the EPA and DEQ are requiring changes. Bullseye cannot stay afloat if they can't come up for air.

In order for these companies to survive they need time to install the new baghouses. They need time to raise money (by making glass to sell) to be able to afford these baghouses, as they are all family owned companies. America was built on the sweat of small companies like these.

So please, we need to help this amazing artform stay alive in the USA. Their closure will impact the glass art movement world wide if this industry does not survive. This is an international industry primarily made up of American companies supplying the entire world of Glass Artists. We cannot do this without you.


Help us keep American jobs in America!

Please remember that shutting down American industries will continue to allow foreign companies who are not as concerned with environmental issues to fill those gaps - often with substandard product. 

Please remember that layoffs due to closing those American manufacturers will affect your community by straining resources in an already difficult economy. 

Please remember that it will affect those who may not live in Oregon as well. As a single mother, my artwork supplements my income just enough that I do not have to use public assistance programs. By closing down these manufacturers, you are now actively choosing to affect more than just Oregon.

James,Ofsink,james@ofsink.today,,Oregon,"As a resident of SE Portland my chief concern is for the health of my neighbors, friends, family, and community members. Like many Oregonians I was disturbed to learn about the high levels of heavy metals and other toxins discovered recently in our air. The primary goal of art glass regulation (and other industrial manufacturing regulation) should be to protect the wellbeing of workers, neighbors, and the environment around industrial sites. Resultantly I urge you to develop strong regulations with health-based standards to keep our neighborhood safe. These regulations should be mandatory and apply statewide to large and small manufacturers to make it possible for all Oregonians to breathe clean air. Additionally the health based standards should cover all heavy metals and hazardous air pollutants and take into account cumulative/interactive effects instead of pretending that people are exposed to a single pollutant in isolation. Finally, there must be sufficient monitoring and enforcement of the regulations. As we have seen, rules with largely self-monitoring and inadequate enforcement is not enough to stop toxic pollution. Monitoring should be conducted strategically at undisclosed times and should include fenceline monitoring as well as more general assessment. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil that enriches our gardens belongs to all of us and not just industry. I urge you in the development of these rules to consider the levels of hexavalent chromium, cobalt, mercury, and lead you would be comfortable with your children breathing, consuming, and playing in.

Vivian,Christensen,vivianchristensen@earthlink.net,,Oregon,"As you know, residents of Portland have been breathing unhealthy air for many years. The EPA estimates that Portlandâ€™s air is capable of causing between 26 and 86 extra cancers per 1 million people. In six census tracts near the city center, this cancer rate is worse than 99 percent of the country.  As you are aware, Oregon lags behind California and Washington in enforceable air quality standards. I urge the DEQ to implement art glass regulations that will result in the state meeting meaningful air quality benchmarks.  I also urge the DEQ to require all glass manufacturers to demonstrate on an annual basis that they are using the best available technology to limit toxic emissions from their facilities.  Residents living and working near these facilities should not have to shoulder the burden of poor environmental regulatory oversight.  It is also imperative that the DEQ foster transparency of the amount and types of toxins that industry is emitting throughout Oregon.  In order to win back the publicâ€™s trust, the DEQ must enable the public to view pollution permits as well as the pollution regulations that facilities are required to implement.    I urge the Oregon DEQ to become a national leader in creating meaningful pollution regulations aimed at protecting human health and the environment.

- Health based regulation that incorporate the Precautionary Principle.
- Clause to allow for the future addition of other materials from glass manufacturing if found to exceed either short and/or long term health standards for air shed quality.
- Choose limits based on those most at risk, not normal average healthy adults (i.e., children, elders, and those with medical issues). Many of the facilities are near schools and parks, so there are large populations of children that cannot tolerate the same level of pollution as a full grown adult.
- Assume the EPA view that all Cr III converts to Cr 6 in glass production.
- Require filters that are rated to remove 99.9% of emissions.
- Require all furnaces to have said filters if they use HAP.
- Create facility limits, not furnace limits. If you limit based on furnaces, their is the likelihood that the accumulative pollution for all furnaces would be above health based standards.
- Heavy fines for violations and a plan for repeat offenders. The ability to shut facility down if it poses an immediate risk to the public and environment.
- Incorporate full health and environmental costs into account. Both long and short term.
- Health before profits. The cost of pollution will always outweigh any benefits a facility brings to the economy. We can get new jobs, develop new ways to make glass, yet we can't prevent the damage that has already been done to our bodies. Damage that may take years to surface.
- Ensure their coldshops (where they cut the glass) and resulting wastewater are safe. Incorporate direction/regulation/fines to ensure their coldshops do not result in environmental damage (i.e., fine glass particulates making their way into the water system).
- Incorporate direction/regulation/fines related to the fine glass particulates that have the ability to become airborne, as well as the glass fragments that litter the perimeter of their facility (particularly near their scrap collection bins).
- Incorporate an accumulative pollution approach to permitting (multiple industrial polluters in a small vicinity). There may be health based limits, but if two polluters are hitting both of their limits in a small geographical area, it will double the health/environmental impact of said pollutant and cause damage to people and the environment. In addition look at how pollution interacts, for example there was a study that showed higher rates of autism when a population was exposed to both styrene and chromium.
- Do not delay implementation beyond the defined timeline.
- Continue to involve the public in the process with transparent decision making and public input.
- Continue to monitor the air quality near these facilities.
Beyond just these rules:
- A public notification system for the permitting process (new and renewals). DEQ has a responsibility to ensure homeowners, businesses, and schools are aware of the pollution that is being permitted in their area. Currently there is no system in place that provides transparent and easy to access information for the public. We have a right to know who permits what, and we have a right to as a community, refuse to allow a polluter into our neighborhoods if they cannot do business responsibly or if their business puts the public or environment at unnecessary risk. We need in-person mailers to all homes, businesses, and schools within a determined radius of the facility (i.e., a mile) with information on the permit, other polluters nearby (so we can have an understanding of the addition of pollution being made to the area). In addition, an accessible online mapping system that identifies all facilities, all hazardous materials used/on site, the health effects (long and short) on the specific materials, permitting allowances for their facility, when a permit ends/begins, and air/water/soil monitoring data etc....

Health-based regulations must be put in place that favor human health over profit.   Relying on the Clean Air Actâ€™s Emissions Standards for Hazard Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), which regulates point sources of air toxics (including heavy metals) only when a single industrial source has total annual emissions exceeding 10 tons of each air toxin (or 25 tons per year of aggregated toxic emissions) from a single source does not protect the public from the harmful effects of toxins that are emitted into neighboring communities from industrial polluters.

...- DEQ needs to start collecting all info on all hazardous materials used on all sites, not just a lump sum of 

pollution.
- DEQ needs to advocate for funding. Show the public why you need it and what it is for. The DEQ is severely 

underfunded.
- DEQ should have informed the public of the high levels of cadmium when they first knew. DEQ needs to start 

notifying the public immediately to instances such as these.
- DEQ needs source and ambient air monitoring. The ability for DEQ to do source testing needs to be included in 

all permits moving forward.
- DEQ needs to do statewide moss sampling.
- Realize that for all the out of state glass artists that Bullseye has recruited to contribute their comments, 

their numbers pale in comparison to the affected families around these facilities. Be aware that many working 

families that are impacted by this pollution do not have the luxury to comment on these rules; be it time, access 

to the internet, or even being aware of this issue.
Our air, water, and soil is community based. We all need it to be clean and healthy for generations to come. A 

facility does not have the right to put others at risk simply by paying a small fee and all the while the public 

is none the wiser. Bullseye is the catalyst. It is my sincere hope that DEQ does not stop here because the public 

sure won't.

In the past, I've run an environmental organization to protect Lake Michiganâ€™s water quality. I know from experience that the most effective way to effect change to protect the environment is to work in concert with government agencies, scientists, businesses, citizens groups, and individuals. As an environmental activist, I have fostered communication and cooperation among these sometimes varying interests. It might not be the quickest method, but it is the most long-lasting. I know itâ€™s a challenge to balance the health needs of city residents with the economic viability of local industries. I also know what a company looks like when it is trying to skirt the law, and I'm here to tell you today that Bullseye Glass is not one of those companies. I've been a Bullseye customer for more than 20 years. I've been to the BE Portland several times, toured the facility, met many of the staff, and taken classes there. I think that it's fair to say that this whole problem with emissions arose, not because Bullseye was attempting to defy or skirt regulations, but because the regulatory â€œholes in the netâ€&#65533; were simply too big for smaller companies like Bullseye to get noticed. I believe the citizen uproar resulted from fear and concern, but was based on incomplete evidence and shaky science. Itâ€™s vital for the citizens of Portland to know that their air quality is being protected, but a knee-jerk reaction that might drive Bullseye and other glass companies out of business is both unfair and unprofessional. Bullseye has done its utmost to come into compliance, and as a long-term customer, I know that these continuing improvements are going to be costly, so I and my fellow customers are prepared for increased glass prices because I know that these changes are for the best. What is not acceptable is an unreasonable compliance schedule or vindictive lawsuits that will drive a good company out of business, rob dozens of dedicated employees of their jobs, and leave tens of thousands of glass users around the world without a source of quality art glass. Glass is a material that can be infinitely recycled. I predict that in the near future, glass will replace plastic in many applications, freeing our oceans from the glut of plastic waste. As such, I urge you to think long-term and expand your stance in order to work in partnership with glass companies such as Bullseye. They are the good guys, but they need your guidance. I urge you to dialogue with them to set long-term goals: They need to be encouraged to develop production methods that are both cost-effective and environmentally responsible. A clean, successful company in your state that benefits many people on many levels is something you can be proud of, as opposed to a company needlessly driven out of business. Please help glass companies achieve the former. Thank you.",
Helen,Cowart,helen@elemental.name,Helen Cowart,WA,"I have been a glass-focused artist since 2009 and I have had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with Bullseye Glass, many of the small businesses who sell art glass, and artists who work with art glass. This network and community of people is far reaching. I personally know glass artists in Australia, the United Kingdom, Israel, and France, and I am acquainted with many artists in New Zealand, Argentina, Denmark, Canada, Costa Rica, and Switzerland. I know and know of many, many glass artists across the United States.Â 

I personally know several of the employees of Bullseye, and I know through them that the owners are just as concerned about the city they live in. All parties desire the same thing - clean air in their homes and neighborhoods. The only request that is being made by Bullseye and their supporters is to find solutions that are based on valid scientific data, facts, open & rational communication, and reasonable response times.Â 

It is my understanding that there are other companies and manufacturers who are producing as much or more toxic emissions that have not been investigated at all. Professionally unacceptable, in my opinion. Either the laws apply to all or they apply to none.Â 

Please understand that Bullseye is not seeking to be exempt, only that they are given the time to install appropriate emission controls properly. In Lani McGregor's (co-owner of Bullseye) own words ""But all of us here are going to do the right thing, and weâ€™re going to do the right thing if it kills us.â€&#65533;â€¨
Make INFORMED decisions. Make sure the new laws, rules, and regulations are developed in a sound, scientific manner, researching and studying all the data that is available. And then apply those laws, rules, and regulations equally and fairly to all. 

After all, we want the same clean air to breathe and safe soil to live on.Â â€¨

Thank your for your time and efforts.",

Michael,Aiello,redbarn.studio@live.com,Aiello Fine Art,OR,"I Live .4 miles from Bullseye for the past 9 years. Me my wife Amy and my 6 year old daughter each have High levels of Lead, Barium, Arsenic, Nickel and Cadmium. My daughter has high levels of Arsenic and Cadmium. We are not eating out of our garden this year, being unable to afford hauling in fresh soil or the cost of building raised beds. In fact, we have already spent about $700 on various tests for our bodies and are being advised by our Naturopath to undergo chelation over this year. The costs of that will likely go into the thousands. I am joining Erin Brokovitz's lawfirms lawsuit and if I am able I will advocate for the DEQ also being accountable. 

These are the actions that the DEQ needs to enact to be a trusted agency in my eyes, otherwise regardless of the excuses, DEQ will continue to be a disappointment to me, my family and community.

1. PLEASE, close loopholes that would allow for emissions of heavy metals in uncontrolled furnaces.
2. PLEASE, apply these state wide.
3. PLEASE, apply these to all glass manufacturers, not just those producing 10 tons per year.
4. PLEASE, apply to all heavy metal by September 1st.
5. PLEASE, ensure public notice and comment instead of locking us out of DEQ decisions.
6. PLEASE, create and enforce rules that will cover all heavy metals.
7. PLEASE, create and enforce true HEALTH BASED STANDARDS.

Michael,Aiello,redbarn.studio@live.com,,"Portland, Oregon","I already wrote with my recommendations. Me and my family live .4 miles from Bullseye and are the victims of their 42 years of non stop unregulated heavy metal pollution. Aside from my respiratory issues and my daughters demineralization and high metals levels, our immediate neighbors include 2 non genetic cancer victims and another woman who has 3 autoimmune diseases. The only difference between us and them is that we've only been here for 9 years and they all have been here the entire time that Bullseye has been polluting. This message is to all the people who are asking not to affect the art glass industry, YOU FOLKS DON""T REALIZE THAT INNOCENT CHILDREN ARE THE VICTIMS OF YOU ART GLASS!! It is selfish to advocate for Bullseye when local neighbors here are currently suffering health issues directly related to their polluting.

Katharine,Salzmann,katharinesalzmann@gmail.com,Eastside Portland Air Coalition (EPAC),Oregon,"I would like to request the following changes to the Temporary Rules for Art Glass Manufacturers:  

1. Please include ALL heavy metals and potentially toxic substances used and emitted in the glassmaking process. Selenium, for example, is not included and our neighborhood was recently exposed to a spike in this Hazardous Air Pollutant because it is still unregulated. ALL toxic and potentially toxic substances used and emitted during the glassmaking process should be included and controlled.
2. Please revisit the short-term and long-term benchmarks established in the Temporary Rules. I realize this document was made in extreme haste. In anticipation of the Cleaner Air Oregon regulatory overhaul, now is an opportune time to apply the most protective benchmarks available. I am sure you have staff who have been researching this. Please change the Temporary Rules to reflect the MOST HEALTH PROTECTIVE benchmarks possible.
3. Please expand this rule to cover the entire State of Oregon. It is my understanding that a search was done for other art glass manufacturers statewide and none were found. I am in no position to confirm this, but in anticipation of new businesses springing up, and to protect residents outside the Portland Air Quality Maintenance Area, these rules should be applied statewide. 
Also, omitted from the Rules are two large Portland glass recyclers, General Glass Company and Owens-Brockway, which sit in two arsenic hot spots identified by the USFS Moss Study. Why?  
4. The Rules should be amended to apply to all glass factories, not just art glass manufacturers and not just those that produce 10 tons per year. Please explore ways to include those two Portland glass recyclers and methods for preventing pollution from any glassmaker handling hazardous materials, not just art glassmakers. 
5. Section 340-244-9070 of the Temporary Rules currently requires emissions control device that meets 99.0 percent or more removal efficiency for particulate matter. At a recent DEQ meeting allowing public comment on making the Temporary Rules permanent, the DEQ rule-writer repeatedly referred to the control requirement as 99.9 percent. That is not what it says in the Temporary Rules, but that is what it SHOULD SAY: 99.9 percent removal efficiency.

We have born a terrible burden in SE Portland for 42 years. Imagining the data from the October air monitoring extrapolated daily for decades, and watching what has occurred in the local airshed even with the Temporary Rules in place has been at once terrifying and utterly dismaying. Given that modern technology exists to filter up to 99.9% of HAPs, there is simply no reason to allow uncontrolled and unregulated emissions of any kind to continue to occur anywhere ever again. 

And finally, I would once again like to ask that the DEQ be brought into the 21st century by employing modern video recording equipment for ALL PUBLIC MEETINGS, making those available online and through social media, so that discussion and information are more readily available for working people who would like to participate and stay informed. The Oregon Attorney Generalâ€™s recent ruling that prohibits DEQ from charging the public for access to public documents denotes a real sea change for agency transparency. The public cannot support you or advocate for you with our legislators, nor can we make substantive commentary unless we understand the ways you are striving to protect us and our environment from hazardous pollution. We must have meaningful access to these essential public proceedings.

Josephine,Geiger,jageiger.studio@comcast.net,"J A GEIGER STUDIO, LLC",MN,"As a professional glass, I am all for the safe production of my raw materials. With that said, Bullseye, Uroboros, and the half dozen other art glass manufacturers across the country seem to be unfairly targeted by this witch-hunt. I call it a witch-hunt because even with extremely limited production for the last six months, the emissions monitoring during that time show little to no change in air quality. This definitely suggests that the problem is likely coming from another source.   Please use accurate and fair data to make your assessments and rule definitions. And be fair in the application of these regulations: if this were Exxon polluting the air, water and soil, would they be given the same treatment? It seems that the small independent businesses are footing the bill in lost production for rules and regulations that are being changed and eliminated overnight. While the biggest companies are given years to implement new regulatory controls â€“ how is that fair? Please, please use actual scientific data (not some bloggerâ€™s hysteria) to determine the new regulations. And, as another commenter pointed out, there is a simple fix to everything: close the loophole on the definition of batch production. Because that is basically what is happening here. The art glass industry has followed the rules, and like any logical entity, utilized the loophole to its advantage - so close the loophole. 
As for economic impact, this is huge. I make my living as a glass artist. If the new regulations cause more art glass manufacturers to go out of business, like Spectrum Art Glass did as a direct result of this, the art glass world may very well collapse. Having Spectrum already out of business has already impacted my business, as well as countless others. I bought as much stock as I could afford to buy, using up my entire emergency fund, which means I actually have no money for an actual emergency. This is because Spectrum makes a few types of glass completely unique which I use in much of my artwork, and not having any more will have a huge impact on my business and is consequently forcing a change in my artistic style. 
Bullseye and Uroboros are two of my primary material suppliers, especially for fusible/compatible glass. I have had to reduce my own production and limit my artwork because so much glass are unavailable, and still is not back into production, which means my sales have declined and my commissions have been delayed. This all adds up to less income. Multiply this by the hundreds of thousands of other artists and glass professionals, and this is a HUGE economic wheel. Not to mention that every single manufacture has increased prices by at least 10%, sometimes as much as %15. Since sheet glass is 80% of my yearly material expenses each year that will be a huge impact upon my bottom line.
Please, please consider the impact on all jobs, tax revenues, not just those in Portland. The limited win on pollution control when applying subjective and stringent rules on the glass industry with virtually no notification creates direct hardships that these small industries can barely weather. This effort has a huge financial impact and may well cause production to shift overseas. Sending production to China will not clean our air. It will not support the Oregonians who work in the art glass industry, nor any of those across our continent and the rest of the world. It will not provide any tax revenues. 
Thank you for your time. Please consider using to have a real impact on our health and air quality, on art and our economy as changes are made in environmental regulations.

Isa,Dean,isad@multcolib.org,Humboldt Neighborhood Association,Oregon,"Hello,

As a member of the Humboldt Neighborhood Association board, I am writing in support of the letter submitted by NE Coalition of Neighborhoods which requests:

Ensuring leadership that prioritizes health-based standards. It is important to hire a DEQ Director who understands how to make health-based decisions on permitting and regulation. Any new Environmental Quality Commission board members should also understand the importance protecting human health. 

Ongoing information and comprehensive air emissions data, concentration maps, locations, producers (known and unknown), and associated emissions health risks. Comprehensive information surrounding air toxics emissions taking place throughout the City of Portland is lacking. We recognize that regulatory actions have been taken to identify and inspect facilities, collect data, and increase air-monitoring capabilities. We are asking that DEQ and associated organizations provide the public with all the most up-to-date and comprehensive information that is ongoing, clear, and accessible to all.

Hexavalent chromium levels in the air need to be addressed. As indicated in the available data, there are currently many unknowns, one of which is of huge concern for the community: levels of hexavalent chromium. Hexavalent chromium is a known carcinogen, yet the Department currently lacks information regarding hexavalent chromium users and levels. The little information that is available does not differentiate between hexavalent chromium and other chromium. 


Provide continuous information for the community that is translated for non-English speakers. We ask the DEQ and associated agencies to conduct additional information/community forums, provide translation for all materials released regarding the situation, and conduct culturally-specific outreach to non-English speakers, communities of color, and low-income communities.  


Make air emissions permits publicly available, not just through public record release requests. Permits provided by the DEQ are public records, and any member of the public should be able to access these records without going through the lengthy and costly process of submitting a public records release request. The simplest way to rectify this is to provide permits online, through DEQâ€™s website.  Ideally, permits would be available in a searchable database.

Provide clarification regarding the timeline released by the DEQ and associated entities, as this situation seems to have gone on for some time without informing the public at large formally. The press release on February 3, 2016 references this situation as a rapidly evolving one, even though this appears to have originated as far back as 2003. For example, in 2009 monitoring of the Harriet Tubman School in NE Portland revealed that Uroboros was noted as a potential source of cadmium emissions.  

Focus on diesel particulates. One of the most serious current threats to public health from air pollution comes from the burning of diesel fuel. Oregon has become a dumping ground for dirty diesel and should develop an aggressive approach to these health threats.

Thank you,

Isa Dean

Your narrow view of the impact of shutting down the glass business is very dangerous.  These companies supply glass at an international level, so the impact is global, not just little Portland.  I would ask if the companies were  billion dollar businesses and were contributing money to the Governor of Oregon, would they be treated in the same manner you are currently treating them?  From everything I can see the companies are willing to comply, but the dates given are rather ridiculous at best.  Stop the panic and help the businesses! ",

Rob,Nosse,rep.robnosse@state.or.us,,Oregon,"As a representative and resident of Southeast Portland, I am deeply concerned about the environmental and human health impacts of uncontrolled metal emissions.Â  If we truly care about the health of all Oregonians, I encourage the DEQ and EQC to consider extending the permanent rule to art glass manufacturers statewide. The issue of industrial air toxics is not limited to the Portland Metro Area, and the proposed permanent rule may provide a competitive advantage to businesses in other regions of the state. I believe that all known sources of air pollution should be subject to the DEQâ€™s health-based regulations, regardless of geographic location. In broadening the scope of the permanent rule, we can better protect the health and wellbeing of all Oregon residents.",

Cindy,Young,rocknrollschool@msn.com,EPAC,Oregon,"As a long term resident living less than a half mile from Bullseye and a member of EPAC I have followed the rule making process and these are my concerns.
Concerns that were also shared by all participants of the fiscal committee.
The rule is to regulate companies that make over 10 tons of glass containing the 6 metal haps (cadmium,lead, nickel, chrome, manganese and arsenic). After looking at the rule for the smaller glass producers I think each tier 1 manufacture makes less than 10 tons of glass containing the metals haps in question so that would leave all tier 1 manufactures exempt of the whole temp rule and possibly the permanent rules as well. This is a very big concern. Again deq leaving loopholes for companies to do what they want.

As the rules sit now you could move your facility out of the Portland area and continue business as usual.

Cindy,Young,rocknrollschool@msn.com,EPAC,Oregon,"As a long term resident living less than a half mile from Bullseye and a member of EPAC I have followed the rule making process and these are my concerns.
Concerns that were also shared by all participants of the fiscal committee.
The rule is to regulate companies that make over 10 tons of glass containing the 6 metal haps (cadmium,lead, nickel, chrome, manganese and arsenic). After looking at the rule for the smaller glass producers I think each tier 1 manufacture makes less than 10 tons of glass containing the metals haps in question so that would leave all tier 1 manufactures exempt of the whole temp rule and possibly the permanent rules as well. This is a very big concern. Again deq leaving loopholes for companies to do what they want. 
The rule should be modified to apply to all sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), ideally, regardless of the amount produced. However, if a threshold is needed, we suggest that the rule apply to manufacturers of greater than 500 pounds of colored art glass per year. This would prevent smaller, unregulated, colored art glass manufacturers from starting up in lieu of the larger, tiered regulated manufacturers. This modification would be consistent with the goal of reducing the amount of HAPs being discharged to the atmosphere.

2. Make sure the health safety benchmarks are the most protective of human health they can be 3. Expand this rule to cover the whole state of Oregon 4. Apply the rules to all glass factories, not just art glass manufacturers 5. Require 99.9% capture rate on emissions control devices.

Thank you,

Craig ,Merriman,camerriman@gmail.com,none,Washington,"It's important to use fundamental scientific methods to describe the problem around the Fred Meyer Daycare. There is some serious flaws to the methodology used to document the heavy metals detected in the air.  The biggest problem with the Wide Area Sampling Plan is that the DEQ failed to collect wind data. Without wind data, it is speculation as the the source of the heavy metals around the daycare. DEQ needs to start over with the plan or include wind direction & velocity data with the plan. Because wind data wasn't collected, the DEQ has put theory ahead of facts - this leads to trying to get the facts to fit the theory. It's supposed to be the other way around - do experiments to collect data - then form your theory based on the results.  As it is, when you do compare wind direction & velocity data - it's pretty apparent that over 90% of the sample data was taken when Bullseye Glass was downwind or abeam the air quality monitoring station. When you look at the data to see where the heavy metals are coming from - it points across the street to the Lehigh Southwest Cement. The highest lead levels detected at Fred Meyer were when the monitoring station was directly downwind of Lehigh. Lehigh Cement was upwind of the monitoring station for 51 days out of 104 - This means that the data that the DEQ is referring to to make decisions is based mostly on the heavy metals from Lehigh Cement.  The problem is that the Lehigh Cement is adding fly ash to the concrete. Fly ash is coal ash. If you look at the air sample data, you will see the same ratio in heavy metals in fly ash as whit is detected. The data also shows that particulate is being lofted into the atmosphere via the same physical processes as dust storms - higher the wind velocity, higher the concentration of particulate. The air sampling data is consistent with cement dust being kicked up by the wind. The data is not consistent with chimney emissions.  When is the DEQ going to do some *real* science to solve this problem?  When is the DEQ going to tell the parents of the kids at the daycare that their kids daycare is across the street from a hazardous waste treatment facility. Concrete is just one method to encapsulate contaminants - it's just in process across the street until water and aggregate is added to solidify it. The fly ash is just as hazardous as the fly ash that is regulated at the generator -  probably explains the heavy metals in north Portland at CalPortland Cement.  When id the DEQ going to tell people about the hazardous waste that is being treated in Portland. When is the State going to regulate the safe handling & transportation of fly ash?",https://data.oregon.gov/views/54i7-gnrh/files/cd3696dc-b2d9-400c-bcfc-f2279424eed8?filename=wind-by-degrees.png

Michelle ,Galli,Galli.michelle@att.net,,Oregon,"I am a glass artist and have been following the news regarding air quality in the Portland area specifically relating to the glass factories.  I am concerned about environmental health issues and support fair rules that allow these companies to continue to produce glass while decreasing harmful emissions.  However, I am troubled by the focus solely on the glass industries when many nearby businesses are contributing and possibly are primary sources of these harmful emissions.  I have been to Bullseye and Uroborus factories and they are both located in Industrial areas.  Science should dictate the rules and not emotions.  Wind direction on test days should be factored in the equation.  I urge you to allow adequate time and to work with the glass companies to enable them to continue to produce this wonderful glass so many worldwide artists depend on as their medium to create beautiful art.

Craig,Merriman,camerriman@gmail.com,,Washington,"There is really no way to proceed without all the facts about the air quality. Without wind direction & velocity data, you cannot effectively identify or rule out the sources of heavy metals detected at the daycare.  DEQ needs to start over - DEQ needs to collect wind data at the same location and times the air sampling is done. DEQ also needs to understand that ambient air monitoring in an error - ambient air monitoring is typically employed in buildings with closed environments. For outside, wind data is imperative as the atmosphere is dynamic.  When wind direction & velocity data is compared to the air sampling data - it indicates that the highest heavy metal concentrations detected at the daycare came from nearly 40 degrees south of Bullseye Glass - the location of Lehigh Southwest Cement. Lehigh is within 100' feet of the monitoring station with a huge footprint - meaning that anytime the wind is from 285 through 325, the air monitoring station is downwind. Wind direction and velocity data indicate that the air monitoring station was downwind of Lehigh for 51 out of 104 days sampled - about 6 days it was downwind of Bullseye Glass.

Similar pattern at Powell Park & 22nd - Monitoring station is only downwind for a few days out of 104.

The detected levels are quite different between the two stations. All things being equal, then the detected levels should be similar or closer than they are. The reason for the discrepancy is that Powell Park monitoring station is farther away from Lehigh.

It's not possible to engage in rulemaking without *all* the facts. The proposed rules will do nothing to reduce the heavy metals being lofted into the atmosphere at Lehigh. The infants & children under 5 will still be in harms way.  This IS the reason why wind direction & velocity data is critical. The health & safety of children is at stake. DEQ must get it right the first time. STOP - START OVER COLLECT WIND DATA.  ",https://data.oregon.gov/views/54i7-gnrh/files/465aa1ac-6426-4a7a-9699-56dfe7ac4bdc?filename=daycare-cement.jpg
Craig,Merriman,camerriman@gmail.com,,Washington,"This is the info graphic I intended to include in previous comments.

When wind data is compared to the air sampling data, it shows for example, the winds on 5/9/2016 were from 299 from 8 to 25 mph. The day preceding, 314, the day after 308. Wind direction and velocity data indicate that the source of lead detected near the daycare was from Lehigh Southwest. Encapsulating toxins in concrete is one method of hazardous waste treatment. Fly ash is added to improve performance. Sampling data detected a similar rate of occurrence of heavy metals.

Because no wind data was collected or analyzed, this has led to the perpetuation of folk theory as fact. DEQ needs to get all the facts first. This is why it is necessary to STOP & START OVER.  

No wind data is a HUGE error. How can you say for sure where things are coming from when you have this daycare that is jutting into industrial zoned land - or, a target rich environment. It's imperative that the DEQ either identify or rule out sources in this environment. 

Impossible to engage in rulemaking with shoddy science.",https://data.oregon.gov/views/54i7-gnrh/files/182a2f9c-dd79-4d80-b6e9-0f2b94a4fd27?filename=wind-by-degrees.jpg

- The rules should apply to all glass manufacturers not just those that produce 10 tons per year.  9.9 tons is still a MASSIVE amount of emissions into the air of these toxic materials.
- Please also ensure public notice and comment instead of limiting the public out of DEQ decisions.
- I would like the rules to cover all heavy metals and HAPS.

- Have real health based standards when determining concentration levels that are protective of human health
- Use the precautionary principle.

Thank you.  I would welcome the permit writers response to see if you feel these are reasonable.  I very much hope they are all incorporated on this critical issue that is impacting many people's lives.

My teen daughter, raised and born less than one half mile from Bullsesye, has a chronic, debilitating nerve disorder which affects her stamina, causes super fast heart rate, fatigue, nausea, dizziness and faintness.  This is most likely caused by heavy metals exposure as she has been cleared of all other possible causes.  My next door neighbor has an aggressive form of breast cancer.  My son has inflammation of the knees which prevents him from running and can be excerbated by heavy metals.  My daughter also has bad asthma and allergies.  We have eaten from my garden daily for sixteen years and my plants were tested at A and L labs and although my garden soil, regularly amended organically, fell within DEQ normal range for heavy metals, my mint, parsley, chard, kale and borage tested at toxic levels for cadmium and lead as determined by standards of the World Health Organization and California Agricultural Standards.  We have been breathing very toxic Chromium 6 for at least half a year now, quite likely decades, by the DEQ's own admission.  This as well as arsenic, cadmium, lead, manganese, cobalt and nickel.  Why is this continuing?  My son wakes up every day with a sore throat and so do my huband and I.  I ",

Laurie,Adams,Laurieadams101@yahio.com,Citizen,Oregon,"I am concerned and frustrated that in the place of hard science and unbiased research,  DEQ is more committed to exercising strong-arm techniques and pushing politics during an election year.   At the beginning, you came out stating the fault was Bullseye Glass and dismissing any other sources.  Little if any investigation was given to other industrial companies.  Furthermore,  you are blatantly discounting wind speed, direction and local excavation.  I am truly appalled at the direction this agency and our state government have taken.

The issue of industrial air toxics is not limited to the Portland Metro Area, and the proposed permanent rule may provide a competitive advantage to businesses in other regions of the state. I believe that all known sources of air pollution should be subject to the DEQâ€™s health-based regulations, regardless of geographic location. In broadening the scope of the permanent rule, we can better protect the health and wellbeing of all Oregon residents.",

I would request you:
- Close loopholes that would allow for emissions of heavy metals from uncontrolled furnaces
- Apply this to all heavy metals by September 1st.
- Both filterable and condensable hazardous emissions must be controlled at 99.9% capture
- Importantly, the current rules only apply to a narrow geographic area - they should apply state-wide!  Or if not then to all urban areas.
- The rules should apply to all glass manufacturers not just those that produce 10 tons per year.  9.9 tons is still a MASSIVE amount of emissions into the air of these toxic materials.
- Please also ensure public notice and comment instead of limiting the public out of DEQ decisions.
- I would like the rules to cover all heavy metals and HAPS.

- Have real health based standards when determining concentration levels that are protective of human health
- Use the precautionary principle.

Thank you.  I would welcome the permit writers response to see if you feel these are reasonable.  I very much hope they are all incorporated on this critical issue that is impacting many people's lives.

Ted,Whitney,tr_whitney@yahoo.com,,Oregon,"I am a glass and multimedia artist residing in Portland, Oregon.  I have used glass manufactured by Bullseye and Uroboros for many years.  I have the following comments on the proposed rules for colored art glass manufacturers.
1)  The DEQ should close any and all loopholes that allow emissions of heavy metals from uncontrolled furnaces.  All furnaces that emit HAP must have filters that filter 99.9% of ALL emissions.  This should include condensable particulate matter.
2) Rules regarding heavy metal air pollutants should be applied state wide, not just on two companies in Portland.
3) All rules regarding HAPs emitted by colored glass manufacturers would apply to ALL glass manufacturers, not just the companies that produce 10 tons of glass per year.  The separation of glass manufacturers into Tier I and Tier II is should not exist and contradicts the health-based regulation that Governor Brown has demanded.
4) The rules should apply to all heavy metals emissions by September 1, 2016.  Implementing these rules at a later date will cause further harm to human health.
5) DEQ should ensure that there is always public notice and comment on all rules and DEQ should never leave the public out of the decision making process.  Adequate and immediate public notice should occur for any air quality permitting in any Oregon neighborhood.
6) All rules and standards should be health, not technology, based.  The current temporary rules are technology based and should be revised to be health-based.
7) Health based standards for emissions should make sense.  For example, hexavalent chromium emissions are set at 0.08 ng/m3 annual maximum but the daily maximum limit of 36 ng/m3, when averaged over a year would exceed the annual maximum on EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE YEAR.  This regulation does not make sense.  Re-write it so that it protects human health.
8) Add a clause to allow for future additions of other materials from glass manufacturing if they are found to exceed short or long term health health thresholds.
9) Set health limits for exposure that are based standards for those most at risk (e.g. children, elderly, health impaired) and take into account the proximity to residential neighborhoods, schools, daycares, and hospitals.
10) Accept the EPA view that 100% of Cr(III) converts to Cr(VI) in glass production.
11) Use facility limits, not furnace limits.
12) Increase fines for violations and require immediate shutdown of repeat offenders.
13) Monitor and restrict fugitive emmissions.
14) Incorporate an accumulative pollution approach to permitting for multiple industrial polluters in a small geographical area.
15) Continue long term air monitoring near glass factories.
16) Collect and maintain a list of all hazardous materials kept on site and used in glass furnaces.  ",
