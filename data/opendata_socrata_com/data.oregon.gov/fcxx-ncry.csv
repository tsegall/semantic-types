"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Universally Offered Newborn Nurse Home Visiting Program,,09/22/2022 03:00:00 PM,09/22/2022 03:00:00 PM,Remotely via Microsoft Teams,Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority (Authority), Public Health Division, Maternal and Child Health Section (MCH) is proposing Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) changes for the Universally offered Newborn Nurse Home Visiting (NNHV) Program. OARs 333-006-0180 through 333-006-0190 will be adopted pursuant to the passage of Senate Bill 1555 (Oregon Laws 2022, chapter 94). SB 1555 requires the Authority, in collaboration with the Department of Business and Consumer Services (DCBS), to adopt rules that establish the amount of reimbursement to be paid by a health benefit plan and a methodology for reimbursing the cost of providing universal newborn nurse home visiting services.

You are being invited to review these proposed rules and to comment on them.  If you wish to present oral testimony, a public hearing will be held on September 22, 2022, at 3:00 PM via video/phone conference using Microsoft Teams.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Oregon Reproductive Health Program,,09/22/2022 11:00:00 AM,09/22/2022 11:00:00 AM,Remotely via Microsoft Teams,Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Public Health Division is proposing to permanently amend Oregon Administrative Rules in chapter 333, division 004 related to the Oregon Reproductive Health Program.

In July 2019, the Oregon Reproductive Health (RH) Program withdrew from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Title X program as a result of new restrictive federal rules that contradicted state law. In the absence of Title X funds and in order to maintain the provision of essential reproductive health services, the RH Program utilized an alternative source of funding, Oregon Reproductive Health Program General Funds, or RH GF, to reimburse certified agencies for clinical services. Under the Biden administration, HHS removed the restrictive rules from Title X and the RH Program submitted an application to rejoin Title X. On March 30, 2022, the RH Program received a notice of grant award and intends to resume use of Title X funds to reimburse for clinical services starting May 1, 2022. Replacing RH GF with federal Title X funds will allow the RH Program to conserve state general funds. Temporary rules to reflect this change were filed on May 1, 2022 (Temporary Administrative Order PH 50-2022). The RH Program now seeks to make these temporary rules permanent. 

Additionally, the RH Program has revised the RHCare Certification Requirements, which are incorporated by reference in the OARs, to ensure realignment with Title X requirements. The RH Program has also made minor revisions to the CCare Certification Requirements and updated the AbortionCare Certification Requirements to match the organizational structure of the RHCare and CCare Certification Requirements. 

Finally, the RH Program inserted language to increase client and provider protections in response to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Supreme Court decision and the subsequent changing legal landscape regarding abortion services across states. 

You are being invited to review these proposed rules and to comment on them. If you wish to present oral testimony, a public hearing will be held remotely by video/phone conference call via Microsoft Teams on September 22, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. To provide oral testimony during this hearing, please contact publichealth.rules@odhsoha.oregon.gov to receive the link for the Microsoft Teams video conference.

OAR 333-019-0010 is a rule concerning school, childcare, and worksite restrictions for individuals who have certain diseases or who are susceptible and exposed to certain diseases. The rule is being amended to eliminate exclusion of students and staff in schools and children’s facilities because of exposure to COVID-19; the requirement to exclude persons with COVID-19 will remain. Definitions no longer needed are also eliminated.

OAR 333-019-1005 sets out public health and safety requirements for childcare providers and youth programs and defines terms used in this rule. The rule is being amended to eliminate exclusion of childcare providers and children, and staff in youth programs because of exposure to COVID-19; the requirement to exclude persons with COVID-19 will remain. Definitions related to these changes that are no longer needed are being eliminated, as are requirements to inform individuals not to enter the childcare or youth program if they are unvaccinated and have been exposed to COVID-19; and to notify and coordinate with local public health authorities if there has been a case of COVID-19 in someone on the premises.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Disease Reporting,"Permanently suspending negative COVID-19 test results from CLIA-waived facilities, including K-12",06/16/2022 09:00:00 AM,06/16/2022 09:00:00 AM,Remote only - Microsoft Teams video/phone conference,Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Public Health Division, is proposing to permanently amend OAR 333-018-0016 in order to continue to suspend all negative COVID-19 result reporting performed under CLIA Certificate of Waiver, including schools and other youth facilities. OAR 333-018-0016 was temporarily amended in January 2022, and this rulemaking is intended to make those amendments permanent prior to their expiration on July 11, 2022.

The expiration of temporary amendments to OAR 333-018-0016 will cause the rule to revert to the original permanent version, which requires the reporting of all COVID-19 test results. Temporary amendments to OAR 333-018-0016 were filed on January 13, 2022 (PH 6-2022) to suspend negative result reporting performed under CLIA Certificate of Waiver in K-12 schools and other youth facilities and then on January 28, 2022 (PH 7-2022) were expanded to suspend all negative result reporting performed under CLIA Certificate of Waiver in response to concerns articulated by providers offering COVID-19 testing under CLIA Certificate of Waiver and Oregon’s K-12 schools. The administrative burden associated with negative result reporting ultimately led to providers and schools facing a choice of noncompliance or discontinuing testing. Effective April 4, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also no longer requires negative result reporting for COVID-19 testing under CLIA Certificate of Waiver.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Masking and vaccination requirements for health care settings,•	Masking and vaccination requirements to control COVID-19 in health care settings (OAR 333-019-1010 and 333-019-1011),01/24/2022 02:00:00 PM,01/24/2022 02:00:00 PM,Remote only - Microsoft Teams video/phone conference, Portland,OR,"The purpose of this hearing is to take public testimony on the proposed adoption of OAR 333-019-1010 and 333-019-1011 regarding ""Masking and vaccination requirements to control COVID-19 in health care settings.""

Importance of Masking
COVID-19 infection is transmitted predominately by inhalation of respiratory droplets generated when people cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. Studies show that masks and face coverings block the release of respiratory droplets into the environment and can also reduce the wearer’s exposure to droplets. COVID-19 viral particles spread between people more readily indoors and when people are closer together for longer periods of time indoors. 

Importance of Vaccinations
It is vital to this state that healthcare providers and healthcare staff be vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 undergoes frequent mutations as it replicates, which over time has resulted in variants that are more transmissible or cause more severe disease. Unvaccinated individuals exposed to COVID-19 are very likely to become infected in the absence of mitigation measures and may then transmit the virus to others. Fully vaccinated people get COVID-19 (known as vaccine breakthrough infections) much less often than unvaccinated people. Being vaccinated is critical to prevent spread of COVID-19. Healthcare providers and healthcare staff have contact with multiple patients over the course of a typical day and week.  The CDC recommends vaccination against COVID-19 for all eligible individuals. 

These rules are necessary to control COVID-19, reduce hospitalizations and deaths, and provide general health protection to people in Oregon.

During a declared state of emergency, Oregon hospitals have been permitted to suspend the nurse staffing plan developed and approved by the hospital nurse staffing committee if the hospital had also implemented its facility disaster plan. The Authority is amending rules to align with 2021 Oregon Laws, Chapter 248 requiring hospitals to implement its facility disaster plan and crisis standards of care during a national or state emergency declaration prior to suspending the nurse staffing plan developed and approved by the hospital nurse staffing committee. 

The amended rules require the hospital incident command to report to the hospital nurse staffing committee a written assessment of the needs arising from the national or state emergency declaration no later than 30 days after any hospital unit or department deviates from its approved nurse staffing plan. Either nurse staffing committee co-chair shall call a meeting of the committee to develop a contingency nurse staffing plan that addresses the needs arising from the emergency. The hospital may not deviate from the written hospital-wide staffing plan approved by the hospital nurse staffing committee for more than 90 days without approval from the hospital nurse staffing committee. If the hospital nurse staffing committee does not approve the deviation by the 90th day, the hospital must return to the written nurse staffing plan developed and approved by the hospital nurse staffing committee. The hospital shall be required to maintain documentation demonstrating compliance with these rules.

These proposed permanent rules will replace temporary rules scheduled to expire on July 20, 2021.

These proposed rules align state rule requirements with the requirements in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement, that is required to be signed by any person who receives COVID-19 vaccine for administration.  In addition, the proposed rules make clear the state’s authority to manage and oversee the COVID-19 vaccine inventory that is distributed and allocated within the state, clearly establish additional state requirements for persons receiving COVID-19 vaccine, and establishes civil penalties for violations of the rules, not to exceed $500 per violation per day.

•	Conducting biennial surveys instead of triennial;
•	Licensing actions on agencies that demonstrate a pattern of significant and substantiated violations of employment and wage laws and caregiver training requirements; and

The amended rules require reporters to report out-of-state cases to the jurisdictional public health authority of the patient’s residence, rather than to OHA. The amendments remove language rendered obsolete by electronic laboratory reporting. They also require reporting of positive and negative COVID-19 laboratory reports by those testing outside of traditional laboratories—i.e., those conducting “waived” laboratory tests in accordance with the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). Minor housekeeping changes are also being proposed to OAR 333-018-0015.

HB 4212 (Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12), sections 40-43, as passed by the Oregon Legislature during the First Special Session of 2020 in June 2020, requires health care providers, including hospitals and other health care facilities, to collect REALD data for all COVID-19 encounters, and to report those data to the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) through methods described in the rule. REALD data is “race, ethnicity, language and disability” data that is collected from the patient, in order to help define communities that experience health inequities, including from COVID-19. Temporary rules were filed on September 25, 2020 and effective October 1, 2020 with additional amendments filed and effective November 6, 2020.  This proposed permanent rulemaking will replace those temporary rules prior to their expiration on March 29, 2021.

In response to passage of HB 2011 (Oregon Laws 2019, chapter 186), the EMS and Trauma Systems program is amending the continuing education requirements in Appendix 1 to include one hour of cultural competency education for Emergency Medical (EMR) and two hours of cultural competency education for Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), Advanced EMTs, EMT Intermediates (EMT-I) and Paramedics. 

Additional changes include requiring an EMR to have two hours of education on pediatric and obstetric emergencies instead of one hour and eliminating the 'Education Topics Approved by the Medical Director' which was creating confusion for an unaffiliated EMS provider. The 'Miscellaneous EMS Topics' section has increased hours due to removal of the topics approved by an EMS Medical Director, but the overall hours required to renew an EMS provider's license remains the same. Appendix 2, which applies a more equitable distribution of continuing education credit requirements for EMRs and EMT-Is when their initial license has less than 24 months before the license expires, has also been amended to align with the changes in Appendix 1.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the Governor's Executive Order to slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the public health impacts of the pandemic, the Authority is proposing to allow trauma hospital surveys to be conducted using electronic and telecommunication technologies in specific circumstances as opposed to requiring an on-site survey.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many Oregon hospitals revised their visitor policies in order to help protect the health of patients, providers, and staff. The visitor restrictions revealed the need to clarify the difference between visitors and support persons and as a result, SB 1606 was passed during the 2020 Special Session. 

These proposed rules clarify the policy and patient notification requirements; specify that a hospital may not condition the provision of treatment on a patient having a POLST, an advance directive, a form appointing a health care representative, or any instruction relating to the administration, withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures; and require a hospital to conduct a clinical care conference for patients admitted to psychiatric units or for patient's whose request to allow a support person in an operating room, procedure room or other restricted area of the hospital is denied.

The infectious disease and accompanying social distancing measurements have made certain application and program requirements more difficult or impossible to implement.  The proposed rule adjusts program requirements to facilitate both patients’ applications and OMMP’s review and approval process of applications. 

The proposed rule provides more time in the application process for patients to submit the required medical documentation and allows patients, caregivers, or growers more time to submit additional or missing information to the Authority. It allows OMMP to accept government ID cards that expired in 2020 whenever the current rules require a valid government ID to be submitted, due to the expected difficulty in renewing government identification cards during the pandemic. The proposed rule allows OMMP to accept un-notarized documents that current rule requires notarization. The proposed rule is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2021 because the Program expects that the difficulties described above will have lessened or ceased by that time.

In January 2018, the Oregon Reproductive Health Program (RH Program) adopted rules to establish the coverage of all services provided under the RH Program, including those detailed in HB 3391 (Oregon Laws 2017, chapter 721), those covered by the state’s family planning Medicaid waiver program Oregon ContraceptiveCare or CCare, and the state’s Title X grant. Since then, a number of changes, including the state’s withdrawal from the federal Title X program and changes to program requirements, have necessitated significant revisions to the adopted rules. To implement these changes, the Oregon Reproductive Health Program proposes to adopt new rules (OAR 333-004-3000 through 333-004-3240) to integrate the program’s existing Oregon ContraceptiveCare administrative rules (333-004-0000 through 333-004-0230) and Reproductive Health Program administrative rules (333-004-2000 through 333-004-2192) and clarify program certification requirements and coverage of reproductive health services. Once the new rules have been adopted, the existing rules referenced above will be repealed on April 15, 2021. This will allow agencies contracted with the RH Program under OAR 333-004-0000 through 333-004-2192 a sufficient period of time to become certified under the newly adopted rules.  A crosswalk has been developed to compare the new proposed OARs (333-004-3000 through 333-004-3240) with the current OARs that will be repealed (333-004-0000 through 333-004-2192). The crosswalk is available at the website referenced below. Please note: to correct a typo, the “and” in OAR 333-004-3050(2)(d) will be changed to “or” in the final, filed rules.

The proposed permanent rules pertain to program requirements for agencies certified with the Oregon Reproductive Health Program for the provision of clinical services, client eligibility and enrollment requirements for the Reproductive Health Program Access Fund, and covered services under the Reproductive Health Program Access Fund.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Emergency Medical Services,,11/20/2020 10:30:00 AM,11/20/2020 10:30:00 AM,VIA CONFERENCE CALL: 1-877-848-7030 Access Code: 2030826#, Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority, Public Health Division, EMS and Trauma Systems program is proposing to permanently amend Oregon Administrative Rules in chapters 333, divisions 250, 255 and 265 relating to compliance with Governor's Executive Orders, ambulance construction criteria, and requirements for ambulance vehicles on reserve or loan. 

In response to revised construction standards adopted by the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services (CAAS) and the National Fire Protection Association, the Authority is revising its ambulance construction criteria to align with these national standards. Additionally, the Authority is adopting by reference, the standards adopted by CAAS for remounting an ambulance vehicle for purposes of patient and EMS provider safety. Terms have been updated and a definition for ‘previously operated ambulance’ has been added for clarity. Based on inquiries from the industry, rules have also been added to clarify requirements for reserve ambulance vehicles and whether a licensed ambulance vehicle can be loaned to another licensed ambulance service agency. 

The Authority is also adopting rules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that clarify  it is a violation for a licensed ambulance service agency to not comply with a Governor's Executive Order and any guidance issued by the Authority as a result of an Executive Order. The Authority may investigate such actions and potentially take licensing action. Additionally, it is expected that licensed EMS providers also comply with Governor's Executive Orders and any subsequent guidance. Failure to comply with such orders could be considered conduct or practice contrary to recognized standards of ethics and as such an EMS provider could be subject to an investigation and possible disciplinary action.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Oregon Medical Marijuana Program,,11/18/2020 10:00:00 AM,11/18/2020 10:00:00 AM,VIA CONFERENCE CALL: 1-877-873-8017 Access: 767068#, Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority, Public Health Division, Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) is proposing to permanently amend and repeal administrative rules in chapter 333, division 7 and division 64. 

Proposed changes clarify testing standards and laboratory accreditation standards. In addition, revisions to the rules are being made to align with changes that occurred in chapter 333, division 8 and chapter 845, division 25 in earlier rulemakings. Lastly, these rule changes allow the Oregon Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (ORELAP) to have more flexibility in their operations so that laboratories may maintain their accreditation when a declaration of emergency in Oregon is issued. The rule changes and a full summary of changes can be found on healthoregon.org/ommprules

In addition, rule changes include repealing labeling rules found under chapter 333, division 7. Due to Senate Bill 1057, passed in the 2017 legislative session (Oregon Laws 2017, Chapter 183), the cannabis labeling authority was transferred from OHA to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC). Labeling rules under OHA are being repealed since these rules are no longer in effect. OLCC labeling rules may be found in OAR 845-025-7000 through 845-025-7190.

Rules related to adding heavy metal testing, mycotoxin testing, and testing for inhalable cannabinoid products that were discussed during the rule advisory committee (RAC) meetings are not being adopted at this time. Instead, these topics will be further discussed with a workgroup. More information on the workgroup may be found at healthoregon.org/ommprules
