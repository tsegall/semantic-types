Janet Shellman ,Sherman,jsssherman@protonmail.com,retired,Oregon,"I strongly support the motion that State administrators designate the North Fork of the Smith River system as an OUTSTANDING RESOURSE WATERS.

Our public and private lands are rich source for mining and timberland clear cutting.  But some public and private lands can no longer be safely used for resource exploitation  1) because of the lack of effective oversight of companies that are given permits for resource exploitation, and 2) because  some of these habitats are vulnerable to BOTH local and collateral damage to water quality, as  frequently arises when upstream resources are procured without oversight.  Our water quality in Oregon is entirely in the hands of our Oregon State administrators, and we the people depend on our administrators for their decision rules to safe guard our precious water.

Many flat-land habitats in Oregon that can lend themselves more readily for resource extraction because damage can be locally contained without collateral threat, and thus should be heavily relied upon for the use rule, when considering resource use.  

By contrast, our cascade watersheds, i.e., those that collectively gather water drainage from its mountain origin to its ocean estuary bed destinations such as our North Fork of the Smith River System in Oregon, should be considered prime habitat for the disuse / preservation rule because of the high risk of local and collateral damage to the public’s common water resource.

The North Fork of the Smith River system, including its ancillary water drainages, sensitively nourishes
--water reservoirs for hundreds of families dwelling along its many borders, 
--breeding habitats of Salmon and Steelhead that in turn affects the economics of our viable fishing and tourist industries, and 
--the estuary habitats that supports our local arthropod industry (prawn, crab, mussel, clams, and etc).

We depend on the North Fork of the Smith system for its outstanding quality of fresh water.   This river system has recently earned a 20 year mineral withdrawal due to our public’s demand for preserving its water quality, and backed mightily by the outstanding legislative work of our own US Representative P. DeFasio and Senators J. Merkley, and R. Wyden.   This river is a crucial Oregon River System that has earned our continued protection and deserves the designated as Oregon’s first OUTSTANDING RESOURCE WATERS.  Make it so!

Would you please protect the pure and pristine waters of the North Fork of the Smith River as ""Outstanding Resource Water"" under the Clean Water Act? Our coastal rivers are bringing so many benefits to our communities, including clean water, Coho salmon spawning grounds and protection for endangered plant communities. This provides fisheries and recreation resources for the growing recreation based economy. Sadly, extractive endeavors, such as mining would destroy much of that. An ORW designation hopefully would prevent this.

Subject:  North Fork Smith River Outstanding Resource Waters Designation Rulemaking 2017 Comments

Dear Mr. Borok,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed designation of the North Fork Smith River in Oregon as Outstanding Resource Waters (ORW).  As the State Senator for the Second Senate District which includes the Smith River watershed in California, I wholeheartedly support the proposed designation.

In 2015 I authored a Senate Joint Resolution (attached) urging the President of the United States and Congress to permanently safeguard the unprotected North Fork of the Smith River watershed in Oregon from any mining activities that would have potential impacts on water supplies, economies, or the environment in Californiaâ€™s portion of the watershed.  The subject Resolution was approved by both the Senate and Assembly in 2015.

As you know from your homework and assessment related to the proposed designation, the Smith River is one of our nationâ€™s premier Wild and Scenic Rivers.  The North Fork Smith River watershed obviously qualifies to be designated as an ORW and is an ideal candidate to be the first ORW in Oregon.

Thank you for your work on this matter which is of great importance to California and downstream residents in my Senate District. If my office can be of assistance please donâ€™t hesitate to call anytime at 916.651.4002.

Warmest Regards,
MIKE McGUIRE

Deborah,Buitron,magpie32@frontier.com,Kalmiopsis Audubon Society & Sunset Garden Club,OR,"Dear Environmental Quality Commission members,
Â 
We strongly urge the Environmental Quality Commission to designate the National Wild and Scenic North Fork of the Smith River in Oregon as an â€œOutstanding Resource Waterâ€&#65533; under the Clean Water Act. The North Fork Smith is an ideal candidate because its near pristine watershed is all public land (including portions of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness) and its waters are incredibly pure. This river provides critical habitat for fish such as coho and its watershed contains spectacular plant communities. We camped along the North Fork of the Smith River last year, and had a wonderful time swimming, hiking and birding. 

The ORW designation for the North Fork Smith in Oregon would add protection for the river that has been threatened by strip mining.  Communities in Southwestern Oregon have overwhelmingly supported protection of wild rivers for their clean water, fishery, and recreation values. For all these reasons, we urge the Environmental Quality Commission to designate the North Fork Smith as an â€œOutstanding Resource Waterâ€&#65533; to help safeguard the purity of this outstanding riverâ€™s water into the future.

Sincerely,

The fact the Commission has never made such a designationâ€”in the 25 years the Outstanding Resource Waters rule has been on the booksâ€”is not a license to continue such delays.  Rather, this is the time for the Commission to finally act in designating some Outstanding Resource Waters.  Frankly, the North Fork Smith River is low-hanging fruit under OAR 340-041-0004(8); there is no public lands grazing in the basin, no mining, and no timber harvest in the proposed area.  The watershed is characterized by incredibly high water quality, and provides habitat and refuge for species including wild salmonids and rare carnivorous plants.

Outstanding Resource Water designation is allowed under the federal Clean Water Act.  Oregon is delegated the responsibility of implementing the federal law and therefore responsible for taking this action.  Oregon has never designated an Outstanding Resource Water and the North Fork of the Smith River is the water body that deserves to be the first.

In addition, under the Clean Water Act an upstream state cannot pollute a downstream stateâ€™s waters.

The North Fork Smith River and all of its tributaries and associated wetlands obviously qualify as an ORW and is an ideal candidate to be the first ORW designated in Oregon. This is an excellent opportunity to implement the Oregon ORW rule as intended.

Cameron,La Follette,cameron@oregoncoastalliance.org,Oregon Coast Alliance,Oregon,"Oregon Coast Alliance (ORCA) strongly supports the designation of the North Fork Smith, its tributaries and associated wetlands, as Outstanding Resource Waters. The tributaries are essential for maintaining the river's legendary water quality, as are the wetlands. The wetlands provide the additional function of cool water and supplemental late season flows. The current uses of the watershed are the best uses: recreation, fishing, hiking and similar activities. The entire watershed is open to the public, as it flows through public land; protecting the North Fork will maintain its public access. Mining, grazing or logging would close it. The designation will also protect all downstream uses, which include (most importantly) the drinking water for thousands of residents, and a robust recreation economy, as well as irrigation. This will be Oregon's first Outstanding Resource Waters designation, which fits in perfectly with the newly-designated 20-year mineral withdrawal, and the Northwest Forest Plan's determination that this watershed should not be in the timber production base. DEQ staff have done excellent work in reviewing the ORW petition and proceeding with rulemaking after  the Environmental Quality Commission's direction to do so. DEQ's Issue paper and statement of fiscal impact both strongly justify the ORW designation, as the North Fork Smith watershed includes portions of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, critical habitat for Threatened coho salmon and rare plants such as Port Orford cedar and Darlingtonia. As a High Quality Water, the North Fork Smith's values must be protected as Outstanding Resource Waters.

These recreation opportunities draw visitors and benefit the economy of the entire Wild Rivers Coast.

The North Fork Smith is home to abundant and diverse populations of winter steelhead, fall chinook, resident rainbow trout, and both resident and sea-run cutthroat trout. All of these wild, native fish depend on the North Forkâ€™s clean water and intact habitats for their survival. The wild salmon and steelhead found in the North Fork play a central role in the regionâ€™s tourism economy, attracting anglers from around the world.

Nancy,Lyford,bryte@frontiernet.net,Self,Oregon,"I live in Oâ€™Brien, Oregon five miles from the North Fork Smith River watershed.  Oâ€™Brien is the closest community to the Oregon portion of the North Fork Smith River basin.  I strongly support classifying the North Fork Smith River and all of its tributaries and associated wetlands as Oregonâ€™s first Outstanding Resource Waters (ORW).  Under the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) antidegradation rules the North Fork Smith River waters must be classified as an ORW because it has High Quality Water and is an outstanding state and national resource with extraordinary values and critical habitat.  The vast majority of the watershed is in its natural condition.

The North Fork Smith River watershed is all public land, being 99% National Forest land managed by the US Forest Service (USFS), and 1% Common School Fund land managed by the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL).  The USFS currently manages its portion of the watershed for Wilderness, Wild and Scenic Rivers, Late Successional Reserve, and Inventoried Roadless Areas.  The watershed is also managed to protect threatened Coho salmon under the Endangered Species Act.  An ORW designation would enhance the protection of the water quality into the future.  The USFS land management would not need to change much under an ORW designation.

The DSL holds the 555 acre Common School Fund Cedar Creek parcel for forestry use.  The DEQ Statement of Fiscal and Economic Impact estimates a potential reduced pond value for logs of about $684,000 to $912,000 due to an ORW designation.  However the pond value appears to be the gross marginal value and not the net marginal value after deducting for expenses such as logging and transportation.  DEQ should estimate and state what the net marginal timber value would be due to an ORW designation.  The DSL management of the Cedar Creek parcel must already account for stream-side buffers and threatened Coho salmon because Cedar Creek, which flows through the parcel, is a salmon-bearing stream.  Those factors further limit the net timber value.  Designating Cedar Creek as an ORW would only limit land activities that degrade water quality.  The value of the Cedar Creek parcel left unlogged could be greater to society than logging it when considering the downstream effects on drinking water supplies and fisheries.  Currently DSL has no plans to log the Cedar Creek parcel and has identified it for disposal.  Selling the unlogged Cedar Creek parcel to a conservation organization could provide more revenue to DSL than logging it would.  Since DSL is a state agency it should support the DEQ antidegradation rules.  In order to protect water quality, all of Cedar Creek should be included within the ORW designation of the North Fork Smith River system.

In conclusion I ask the Environmental Quality Commission to approve the proposed ORW rules as written for the North Fork Smith River and all of its tributaries and associated wetlands in Oregon.

Kelly,Burnett,kellymarieburnett@gmail.com,,Oregon,"As an Oregonian and river enthusiast, I strongly support protecting the pristine waters of the North Fork Smith River. The Department is to be commended for this bold and necessary action to conserve the North Fork Smith River, its tributaries, and associated wetlands.

This designation is important to me for many reasons. The North Fork Smith River is an outstanding water resource for Oregon and for the western US. It sustains native fish and plants as well as provides clean drinking water to many downstream communities, increasingly critical functions in the era of human-induced climate change. Protecting the Smithâ€™s pristine Oregon tributaries, like Baldface Creek, is essential for recovering threatened coho salmon. 
The North Fork Smith supports abundant and diverse populations of winter steelhead, fall chinook, resident rainbow trout, and both resident and sea-run cutthroat trout. All of these wild, native fish depend on the North Forkâ€™s clean water and intact habitats for their survival. 

The North Fork Smith River offers economic benefits for the Wild Rivers Coast by drawing visitors to its outstanding recreation opportunities â€”including winter whitewater boating through a rugged canyon and scenic hiking in remote forests. Additionally, 
the wild salmon and steelhead are essential to the regionâ€™s tourism economy by attracting anglers from around the world. 

The remote Oregon portion of the North Fork Smith River watershed contains no private land and no competing water uses. Most of the basin is on Forest Service land, including the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, two Inventoried Roadless Areas, and a Research Natural Area. For these reasons, the designation is unlikely to have adverse economic effects.

If you couple all that with the fact that Oregonâ€™s regulatory authorization has been gathering dust without a single implementation for going on 3 decades, this seems like it should be an easy decision. 

There are 26 year old Oregonians younger than this regulation whoâ€™ve lived their lives surrounded by wild, vibrant, world-famous rivers, and not one of them have lived to see their state employ this readily-available (and at a casual glance, arguably obligatory) authority to designate even a trickle as Outstanding Resource Waters. I suppose state governments are authorized to do plenty of things they can choose to ignore, but it doesnâ€™t seem right to do so with this one.

The North Fork Smith is an ideal candidate because its near pristine watershed is all public land (including portions of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness) and its blue-green waters are remarkably pure. The river provides critical habitat for threatened SONCC coho and its watershed contains unique groundwater-fed wetland plant communities. Its pure water and renowned fisheries support an important and growing recreation-based economy on Southwest Oregonâ€™s â€œWild Rivers Coast.â€&#65533; Moreover, Outstanding Resource Water designation for the North Fork Smith will help protect all downstream drinking, municipal, and irrigation water supplies.
Further, because the North Fork Smith River is clearly one of the stateâ€™s â€œhigh quality waters,â€&#65533; under Oregon law it â€œâ€¦must be maintained and protected, and classified as Outstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;[OAR 340-041-0004(8))]
Finally, the ORW designation for the North Fork Smith in Oregon would add a much needed extra layer of protection for that river that has been threatened by strip mining, an extraction-based industry with potential to irrevocably degrade the outstanding water quality for which the entire Smith River watershed is known. Communities in Southwestern Oregon have overwhelmingly supported protection of wild rivers for their clean water, fishery, and recreation values. For all these reasons, I urge the Environmental Quality Commission to designate the waters of the North Fork Smith River and its associated tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Watersâ€&#65533; to help safeguard the purity of this extraordinary waterway into the future.

Sincerely,
467 California, Oregon, and national Smith River-loving citizens, as below:

I am writing to express my strong support for designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding Resource Water.  

I have visited the N.F. Smith River on many occasions and live close to this most impressive watershed.  From first hand experience, I can attest to the worthiness of the River as an Outstanding Resource.

Anne,Morgan,annemorgancnm@yahoo.com,,Oregon,"Hello:
I've lived in the Northwest all of my life, in Oregon since 1968 and on the southern portion of the Oregon Coast for more than thirty years. I chose to raise my family here and practice my profession here. The main reasons for both of those choices were clean air, clean water and many recreational opportunities. Please support The North Fork of the Smith River as an Outstanding Resource Water.

 The North Fork is such an amazing  and cool place with its winter steelhead (I had fresh caught steelhead last night for dinner), fall Chinook salmon, and beautiful rainbow trout. These native fish require clean water and pristine habitats for their survival.

The wild salmon and steelhead found in the North Fork bring tourists (from around the world) to our area and help feed the economy.

There is no private land in the remote Oregon portion of this watershed and no competing water uses. The vast majority of the watershed lies within Forest Service lands that include the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and a Research Natural Area. 

Last summer, our friends from Eugene spent an extra two days in our area (feeding the economy) just to experience the North Fork of the Smith River. They had heard how very beautiful it was. 

Thank you for helping keep our economy flowing by preserving our watersheds and drinking water.

Sincerely,
Anne Morgan

Mark,Knudsen,knudsenm@spiritone.com,none,Oregon,"I support protections for the clear and pure waters of the North Fork Smith River. Iâ€™d like to thank the Department for taking this needed step to protect the pristine waters of the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and associated wetlands.

This action is important to me because the waters found in the Smith River in Oregon are among the purest on the planet. These waters sustain threatened fish and rare plants while providing clean drinking water to downstream communities. Protecting the Smithâ€™s pristine Oregon tributaries, like Baldface Creek, is critical for ensuring the recovery of threatened coho salmon. Flowing south, the clear blue waters of the Smith in Oregon provide drinking water for several communities as well as outstanding opportunities for recreationâ€”including winter whitewater boating through a rugged canyon as well as scenic hiking through remote forests. These recreation opportunities draw visitors and benefit the economy of the entire Wild Rivers Coast.

The North Fork Smith is home to abundant and diverse populations of winter steelhead, fall chinook, resident rainbow trout, and both resident and sea-run cutthroat trout. All of these wild, native fish depend on the North Forkâ€™s clean water and intact habitats for their survival. The wild salmon and steelhead found in the North Fork play a central role in the regionâ€™s tourism economy, attracting anglers from around the world. 

There is no private land in the remote Oregon portion of this watershed and no competing water uses. The vast majority of the watershed lies within Forest Service lands that include the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, and two Inventoried Roadless Areas, and a Research Natural Area. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Susan,Coyle,susancoyle13@gmail.com,,Oregon,I support the efforts for protection of North Fork Smith River. As an Oregonian I believe our rivers are our heritage and must be protected. Pristine natural areas have become a rarity. This is short sighted management of our natural resources. I am encouraging Oregon DEQ to designate North Fork Smith as an Outstanding Resource Water under the Clean Water Act. Let's continue Oregon's legacy of beautiful landscape for future generations.

I hope they are around still as pristine as now when I return home! Please, with so much of the country under threat from dirty development, letâ€™s keep the North Fork of the Smith River and the watershed clean and available as intact habitat for wildlife.  

Thank you for your good work.

Mark,Tuai,marktuai@gmail.com,,OR,"I fully support the proposed designation of the North Fork of the Smith River as an Outstanding Resource Water. As an angler and outdoorsman, I find peace, solitude, and happiness in recreating in Oregon's watersheds and pursuing steelhead. The designation will ensure that future generations of steelhead, which are already imperiled, are afforded greater protection. This designation imperative because our nation has shifted away from a natural resource driven economy and it is now time for us as a nation to focus our efforts on conservation. ",

Adam,Spencer,redwoodrides@gmail.com,Redwood Rides,CA,"My name is Adam Spencer and I am the co-owner of Redwood Rides Adventure Trips, an outfitter that operates rafting and kayaking trips on the North Fork Smith River as well as many stretches of river downstream of the North Fork Smith River.

Redwood Rides, as well as myself personally, greatly support the designation of the North Fork Smith River, its tributaries and associated wetlands as Outstanding Resource Waters.

Every client, friend and family member that we bring to the North Fork Smith River are quick to recognize the high water quality and unique character of this watershed.  Many people have remarked that it was one of the most pristine areas they have ever seen in the world, often summoning the word ""paradise.""

People come from all over the world to experience this beautiful and unique river, often remarking on the pollution and irreparable damage that has been done to so many other watersheds across the United States and the world.

The Smith River system as a whole is a designated salmon stronghold, the first and one of only a few in California, which I often consider as a safeguard against collapsing salmon runs in other parts of the West Coast.  When other West Coast salmon runs are threatened or their gene pool becomes overly influenced by hatcheries, we can rely on the incubator function of a salmon stronghold like the Smith to help recover neighboring systems. The impeccable water quality and undeveloped character of the North Fork Smith is fundamental in providing the salmon spawning and rearing habitat necessary for the Smith's salmon stronghold status.

Baldface Creek and its perennial tributaries have been found by the Forest Service to be eligible for National Wild and Scenic River status, having the highest potential classification for this designation. A ORW designation is appropriate considering this fact.

The North Fork Smith River provides drinking water directly for more than 800 people in the community of Gasquet, Calif. and the river contributes to the drinking water supply of at least 19,000 more people in Crescent City, Calif and outlying areas.

Additionally, The 555 acres of state land in the headwaters of Cedar Creek should be included in the ORW designation. Cedar Creek, its tributaries and associated wetlands are high quality waters and an essential part of the North Fork Smith River hydrologic unit.

We would like to ensure that our company can continue to provide this amazing visit to a wild place for our guests as part of the sustainable economy the Wild Rivers Coast depends on.  Recreation tourism, commercial and recreation salmon fishing, and clean cold drinking water are all essential for the communities of the Wild Rivers Coast to survive.

Thank you for your consideration.",
CHRISTIE,NELSON,chrisnels22@gmail.com,"N.A,",Oregon,"We strongly support the North Fork Smith River Outstanding Resource Water Rulemaking 2017, protecting the North Fork Smith River, its tributaries and wetlands as Oregonâ€™s first Outstanding Resource Waters.
These waters are among the highest quality waters in the nation, with exceptional clarity, purity and beauty.  We have hiked in this area and are amazed by the pristine quality of these wild waters.
The complexity of this water system, including springs and wetlands, is a result of unusual geology and geography. It supports a unique rare plant habitat worthy of protection.  The springs and wetlands provide cool summer water to tributaries of the North Fork Smith River, enhancing survival for various fish and for the Foothill yellow-legged frog, a state and federal sensitive species.  This is particularly important when conditions are challenged by droughts or climate shifts.
The 555 acres of state land in the headwaters of Cedar Creek should be included in the ORW designation. Cedar Creek, its tributaries and associated wetlands are high quality waters and an essential part of the North Fork Smith River hydrologic unit.
The North Fork Smith River, its tributaries and wetlands are important to local economies and to the quality of life for residents in both Oregon and California. As a unique hydrologic unit, they provide clean, clear drinking water, prized native fish runs and contribute to high quality recreation opportunities in downstream reaches of the National Wild and Scenic North Fork Smith, Middle Fork Smith and mainstem Smith rivers.
The State of Oregon holds these exceptional waters in trust for all its citizens. We urge you to protect and preserve the waters of the North Fork Smith River, its tributaries and associated wetlands as Outstanding Resource Waters under the Clean Water Act.  We thank the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and Oregon Environmental Quality Commission for making the proposal.
Sincerely,
Christie and Mike Nelson",
