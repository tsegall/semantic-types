Tonnie,Cummings,tonnie_cummings@nps.gov,National Park Service,,"The National Park Service appreciates the opportunity to provide the following comments about Oregon Department of Environmental Qualityâ€™s June 16, 2014, proposed amendments to chapter 340 of the Oregon Administrative Rules.  

340-204-0050, Designation of Prevention of Significant Deterioration Areas, (1)(i), Page 87 â€“ Crater Lake National Park was established in 1902 by Public Law 32 Stat. 20.  The park currently has no designated wilderness, so Public Law 88-577 does not apply.  Also, delete â€œand expanded in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.â€&#65533;  Crater Lakeâ€™s last boundary expansion occurred in 1980 under Public Law 96-553. 

340-224-0030, New Source Review Procedural Requirements, (5)(a)(A), Page 284 - We recommend that for the first extension, the source also be required to review the original Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) or Best Available Control Technology (BACT) analysis to determine if lower emission limits are feasible.

340-224-0030, New Source Review Procedural Requirements, (5)(a) and (5)(b), Pages 284-285 - For both a first and a second extension, we recommend the source be required to evaluate LAER or BACT for any pollutants with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) that have been developed since the original application was submitted.  The source should also be required to demonstrate compliance with any new NAAQS that have been developed since the original application was submitted.

340-224-0030, New Source Review Procedural Requirements, (5)(a) and (5)(b), Pages 284-285 - We recommend the rules require the Department of Environmental Quality to notify Federal Land Managers about requests for permit extensions.

Please contact me at tonnie_cummings@nps.gov or 360-816-6201 if you have any questions about our comments or need additional information.

Gitanjali,Hursh,anju@bust.com,home owner & private citizen,Oregon,"I have lived in Oregon for 35 of my 41 yrs. In recent years I have developed asthma & I can't help but wonder if moving back into SE, near Johnson Creek & Precision Cast parts has something to do with my half lung capacity.I understand that PCP might provide local jobs but at the cost of what? Stricter regulations on air pollutants is a no brainer. ",
John,Hayes,jhayes@pacificu.edu,Forest Grove School Board,Oregon,"I wish to present written testimony, below, on the revision to DEQâ€™s air quality rules, specifically as applied to semiconductor manufacturing permits. I am Chair of the Forest Grove School District Board and am writing this in the interest of protecting childrenâ€™s health.

In the November 4, 2013, letter from Thomas R. Wood, Stoel Rives attorney for Intel, to David Monro of Oregon DEQ, Attorney Wood stated on pages 7 & 8:

â€œIntel is willing to go beyond what is required by the Departmentâ€™s regulations in order to assure its neighbors that the company is not making the air unsafe to breathe. If better informing the community what is in its air involves extensive additional testing and undergoing additional permitting, the company is willing to do that. â€¦ Intel anticipates requesting that the Department incorporate the ongoing commitments made to the community into the final Title V permit. Intel is also committing to submit a PSD application covering, at a minimum, its fluoride and GHG emissions. While we do not believe Intel has triggered PSD to date, Intel wants to address the D1X expansion in the most public way possible to ensure that the community has independent verification that Intel is employing Best Available Control Technology (â€œBACTâ€&#65533;) for fluorides and GHGs.â€&#65533;

The key points in Attorney Woodâ€™s paragraph quoted above are these:
â€¢ Intel is willing to go beyond DEQ regulations
â€¢ Intel is willing to undergo additional testing and permitting beyond requirements
â€¢ Intel has committed to submitting a PSD application covering fluoride and GHG emissions
â€¢ Intel wants to ensure that the community has independent verification that it is employing Best Available Control Technology

I believe that, in the interest of protecting childrenâ€™s health, it is important for Oregon DEQ to adopt rules that Intel (and any other producer of semiconductors or related materials) has agreed to that would employ Best Available Control Technology for fluoride and other toxic emissions.

Specifically, please retain Oregon's current regulations and add to Section (66) ""Federal Major Source,"" part (e), source categories:
          (66) (e) (CC) Manufacturing - semiconductor and related devices;

Thank you.

Sincerely,

John Hayes, Chair
Forest Grove School District Board",
Michael,Byrne,mbstonemason@gmail.com,ordinary citizen,Oregon,"There is so much in the air that we breathe that singly could be considered non toxic or even benign when considered individually.

Many of these chemicals combine in the atmosphere to actually create a very hazardous ""stew""

You know the statistics for asthma and autism... please lower the allowable levels of ""neurotoxins"" in our air.

Please take into consideration the cumulative affects of concentrations in neighborhoods and the ""spike phenomenon""  where total releases remain within limits, but concentrated bursts create poor air quality

We must do this for our children.

Thank you.",
Michael,Byrne,mbstonemason@gmail.com,ordinary citizen,Oregon,"Please consider the cumulative affect of all the neurotoxins in any given neighborhood.  Some air sheds are already overloaded.

Spikes occur frequently in the manufacturing process, and may be below within allowable limits, but nonetheless create unhealthy air situations when they occur.  No single release should be above a set level.

Please do this for the children.  Thank you",https://data.oregon.gov/views/2zaf-wufx/files/Fbkx3wLuVCJdUZcpEnXc0q_V7ycubHpj_8Zs1HvgFFo?filename=4+Naphthalene.docx

Peter,Nelson,pete@marcnelsonoil.com,Marc Nelson Oil Products,Oregon,I understand that small gasoline dispensing facilities are exempt from DEQ air quality permitting and reporting.  I think the same should be true for small cardlock gasoline dispensing facilities.  The type of business is so similar why should they be held to different permitting and reporting requirements??,

Richard,Till,rick@gorgefriends.org,Friends of the Columbia Gorge,,"Friends provides the following recommendation as a supplement to our prior comment. Friends recommends that the  DEQ designated the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness as a Class I area subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration standards. The Clean Air Act expressly authorizes that ""a State may redesignate such areas as it deems appropriate as class one areas[.]""  42 USC 7474. 

Pursuant to this authority, the state should provide additional protection to the Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness.

Sincerely,

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=""http://www.SEORankingLinks.us"" target=""_blank"">Seo Plugin</a>",
