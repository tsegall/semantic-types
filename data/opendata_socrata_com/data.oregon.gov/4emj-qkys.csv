DLCD is holding roundtable discussions to collect guidance and hear concerns from affected communities as the state advances our shared work to encourage a variety of housing types to provide residents more diverse housing choices.
Why now? The Oregon Legislature passed two significant housing bills this past legislative session – House Bill 2001 and 2003. The legislature passed these bills to provide additional housing and to help ensure housing production in addition to zoning. 
Purpose: To provide community members and city staff information about two new housing bills and receive community guidance on issues that should be considered early in the process.
