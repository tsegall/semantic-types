John,Giller,jegiller@fs.fed.us,USDA Forest Service,National,"Fuels treatments that do not include prescribed burning are very ineffective.  Look at the Barry Point fire that burned through heavily managed private timber lands, Collins company didn't use prescribed fire after logging so the residual trees all died in the wildfire.  With over 30years of fire behavior experience I'm here to tell you that alternatives to prescribed burning DO NOT reduce fire hazard adequately, please stop promoting that it does; be honest with our landowners cause wildfires don't lie.  If you minimize the amount of prescribed burning that we do in this state, the public will enjoy increased amounts of wildfire smoke all summer long while the wildlife habitat and timber stands burn up, is that really best for our environment?  

Also, please consider that many parts of the US burned frequently in the past and for us to artificially change this now will be futile, we need work with natural cycles, not try to change them to man's needs.

Mark,Jacques,,Blue Mountian Cohesive Strategy Pilot Project,Oregon,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Proposed Smoke Management Rule changes. My comments on the rule changes are from the perspective of the Northern Blue Mountain Cohesive Wildfire Strategy pilot project.   Partners in our pilot project include Federal, State and local fire and forest land managers including County Commissioners, Emergency Mangers and Rural Fire Department Chiefs.  The vision of this national strategy is â€œTo safely and effectively extinguish fire when needed; use fire where allowable; mange our natural resources; and as a nation, live with fire.â€&#65533;  The Strategy takes a holistic approach to wildland fire management by promoting resilient landscapes, creating fire adapted communities and improving wildfire response.    A significant action item of the Cohesive Strategy for attaining these goals is to promote prescribed burning in an effort to assist in creating fire adapted communities and restoring resilient landscapes.
Recently there has been significant focus on forest restoration in the Blue Mountains.  The US Forest Service Regional office has dedicated additional funding to launch the Eastside Strategy to increase the pace and scale of active forest management and restoration in the Blue Mountains.  Additionally the last Legislature made state funds available to assist the Forest Service in increasing forest management and restoration activities in eastern Oregon.  Prescribed burning is an important tool in this forest restoration effort and also in maintaining landscapes where forest restoration activity has occurred.  In efforts to comply with current smoke management rules, the Wallowa Whitman National Forest already has an estimated 90,000 acres of backlog in its normal prescribed burning program. 
At issue is the proposed Smoke Management Rule change to include the Eagle Cap Wilderness and Hells Canyon Wilderness as â€œClass 1 Areas subject to year round visibility protectionâ€&#65533; rather than the current protection time period of July 1 to September 15.  This change will greatly hamper not only the current prescribed burning program in the northern Blue Mountains but would have negative effects on any  efforts to increase prescribed burning  and thus reduce the effectiveness of the many efforts being made to  increase the pace and scale of forest management and restoration in the Blue Mountains.  This rule change will also affect the ability of private landowners to dispose of their slash from forest management activities and reduce wildfire potential on their lands.   Reference is made to only Crater Lake National Park and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness in the State Implementation Plan for visibility protection, yet the proposed rule change applies to all Class 1 Areas including the Eagle Cap Wilderness and Hellâ€™s Canyon Wilderness.  
Due to the topography and the location of Smoke Sensitive Receptor Areas (SSRAs) in northeast Oregon the inclusion of the Eagle Cap Wilderness and Hells Canyon Wilderness into the year round visibility protection standards will drastically limit the ability to conduct prescribed burning and curtail burning to just the best of days in the already small window of prescribed burning opportunities.   Under the Blue Mountain Cohesive Wildfire Strategy, we support maintaining the current rules with a visibility protection period of July 1 to September `15th in these two wilderness areas.  This also seems to make the most sense since the peak use of these wilderness areas occurs during this time period.  
 I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this very important component of the Cohesive Strategy and the effort to restore resilient landscapes in the Blue Mountains.

Sincerely

Barry,Shullanberger,bshullanberger@fs.fed.us,Fremont-Winema NF and Lakeview District BLM,OR,"The SPZ that is around the community of Lakeview, OR is old and not realistic with smoke patterns and trends.  The Forest, DEQ, the Town of Lakeview, and Lake County have recently signed a MOU that states that the Forest Service will abide by the red yellow green advisory for the Town of Lakeview during the winter months.  The MOU shows a mountain top boundary around the town of Lakeview and the Goose Lake Valley.  Please consider changing the SPZ around Lakeview to the mountain top boundary.  This will add some boundary area to the north of Lakeview and cut off area to the East.  Very rarely does the area have east wind taking smoke over the Warner Mountains into the Town of Lakeview.  If a east wind is scheduled, ODF would not allow burning due to promimity to Lakeview.  This is a common sense change and would also get everyone to be using one boundary instead of two.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",https://data.oregon.gov/views/9z8v-eyhi/files/WoKtFZ9Z59rNibDOUxWCeN9hLoe7fGTfNVglHxV4juc?filename=14MU11060200004LakeCoDEQLakeviewSmokeMgmtSigned.pdf
Barry,Hansen,bahansen@fs.fed.us,Fremon-Winema NF,OR,"I have over 30 years of fuels management experience in Oregon; 20 years in NE OR and the rest here on the Fremont-Winema.  With that in mind, I must state that I am in complete agreement with the previous commenters; John Giller, Mark Jaques, and Barry Shullaberger on all their points.  In addition, I believe that effective long-term management of our forests will require a significant increase in the amount of acres where prescribed fire is applied, not a static or reduced number.  Other fuels treatments can be used, but all must be followed by fire in these fire adapted ecosystems.  In addition, I also agree that the SPZ around Lakeview be replaced with the ""airshed"" boundary line mentioned by Barry Shullanberger that uses the topography surrounding Lakeview as a logical boundary that considers wind and weather patterns here in the Goose Lake valley.  Although it adds significant acreage to the SPZ, it does so in a logical pattern that simplifies management by the Federal agencies. while protecting air quality within Lakeview. 
Thanks for allowing me to comment.",
