The meeting at ODFW Headquarters (4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE, Salem), begins at 8 a.m. and follows this agenda.

ODFW documented 77 known wolves in Oregon in 2014, including 26 pups which survived through the end of the year. Eight of Oregon’s nine known wolf packs were “breeding pairs,” meaning they had at least two pups born in spring that survived through the end of the year. More details are available in the Oregon Wolf Conservation and Management 2014 Annual Report.

The Commission will also be asked to appoint a Landowner Representative to the Access and Habitat statewide board and approve continued funding for several A&H projects that provide public hunting access to private land. 

The Commission will also consider funding $755,093 for 14 enhancement and one restoration projects recommended by the Fish Restoration and Enhancement Board. The Commission also will be asked to approve a combined 2015-17 budget for the R&E and Salmon Trout Enhancement programs. 

The Commission is the policy-making body for fish and wildlife issues in the state. People wanting to testify about issues not on the formal agenda may do so by making arrangements with the ODFW Director’s Office, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, by calling 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044. Testimony for issues not on the agenda is held Friday morning, immediately following the expenditure report.

Fish and Wildlife Department,State Fish and Wildlife Commission Meeting,The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission will set ocean salmon and Pacific halibut seasons and discuss the status of wolves when it meets in Bend on April 24,04/24/2015 08:00:00 AM,04/24/2015 05:00:00 PM,"Deschutes National Forest Office, 63095 Deschutes Market Rd.", Bend,OR,"The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission will set ocean salmon and Pacific halibut seasons and discuss the status of wolves when it meets in Bend on April 24.

The meeting will begin at 8 a.m. at Deschutes National Forest Office, 63095 Deschutes Market Rd., Bend, OR 97701. See the full meeting agenda here: http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/15/04_April/index.asp

The Commission will be asked to set the 2015 ocean salmon and Pacific halibut seasons for Oregon’s territorial waters from shore to three miles out. The seasons in ocean waters beyond three miles already have been set by the Pacific Management Council, and the Commission will consider similar regulations for state waters. In addition, recreational and commercial troll fall Chinook salmon target fisheries in state waters only will be considered for waters adjacent to Tillamook Bay, the Elk River, and the Chetco River.

Due to another year of strong returns of Sacramento and Klamath fall Chinook salmon stocks, ocean Chinook seasons south of Cape Falcon are similar to the relatively robust seasons of recent years. The proposed 2015 ocean salmon seasons are listed on the ODFW Website.

For Pacific halibut, the total 2015 catch limit will be 970,000 pounds, one percent more than in 2014. There are a few changes to the 2015 regulations that affect the sport fisheries:
•A shift of some harvest allocations from the Columbia River Subarea (north of Cape Falcon) and to the Southern Oregon Subarea to better match allocations with recent effort and catches.
•In the Columbia River Subarea the all-depth fishery is combined into a single season beginning in May and running four days a week through September, or until the harvest allocation is attained. Also in this area, the nearshore fishery allocation is reduced to 500 pounds.
•In the area north of Humbug Mt., retention of other flatfish species (such as flounder, sole and sanddabs) when Pacific Halibut are on board is allowed.

The proposed 2015 Pacific halibut seasons are posted on the ODFW Website.

Also, the Commission will be asked to appoint three new members to the Fish Screening Task Force –one to represent agriculture and two to represent fishing/fish conservation. The seven-person task force is appointed by the Commission to advise ODFW staff on fish screening program development, funding and project prioritization.

ODFW staff will present its Biological Status Review for the Gray Wolf in Oregon to the Commission. The state’s Wolf Plan calls for initiating a process to delist wolves from the state Endangered Species Act when Oregon reaches the conservation objective of four breeding pairs for three consecutive years in eastern Oregon. This objective was met in early 2015. 

The Commission will use the Biological Status Review to evaluate whether to move forward with a delisting process. If they decide to do so, a final decision is still several months away, as delisting requires a public process.

“Wolves are a success story in Oregon. Their population is growing and their range is expanding,” said Russ Morgan, ODFW wolf coordinator. “The state’s Wolf Plan has measures to protect wolves into the future should the Commission decide to initiate a delisting process.”

The meeting will be an opportunity for trail users to share ideas on safely crossing the highway, best routes, trailheads, destinations and recreation needs. Comments will be used to update and refine the preliminary concepts laid out for the trail system in the 2009 master plan. 

The public is also invited to comment online at honeymanstatepark.com; by email at jaime.english@oregon.gov; by phone at 503-986-0723; or by mailing written comments to Jaime English, OPRD, 725 Summer St. NE, Suite C, Salem, OR 97301.

Fish and Wildlife Department,Oregon Fish & Wildlife Commission Hearing,"The Fish and Wildlife Commission will meet Friday, June 5 in Salem to finalize controlled hunt tags for the 2015 hunting season and set coastal coho fisheries.",06/05/2015 08:00:00 AM,06/05/2015 05:00:00 AM,"ODFW Headquarters in the Commission Room, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE", Salem,OR,"The Fish and Wildlife Commission will meet Friday, June 5 in Salem to finalize controlled hunt tags for the 2015 hunting season and set coastal coho fisheries.

The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at ODFW Headquarters in the Commission Room, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE. The agenda is online at, http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/15/06_june/index.asp

The first order of business for the Commission will be finalizing 2015 controlled hunt tags and considering some changes to 2016 Big Game Regulations (though final 2016 regulations won’t be adopted until October 2015). ODFW staff are proposing that 137,015 controlled hunt big game tags be available this fall.

Major changes under consideration for the 2016 hunting season include:
•A new “premium hunt” series that would offer an opportunity to draw an additional deer, elk, or pronghorn tag with a longer season. These tags would be very limited but available in most areas. Tags would be allocated through the regular controlled hunt draw process but would not use preference points.
•Shift Wendling Travel Management Area (TMA) time period from the start of archery season (when fire danger often limits access) through the end of the rifle buck season, to the opening of the general rifle buck deer season-Nov. 30.
•End Eagle Creek TMA on Willamette National Forest due to low usage by elk and hunters.
•Change renewal period for hunters with a disability permit from every two years to every five years.
•Consider new and maintenance cougar target areas to reduce cougar damage to livestock, limit human safety problems, and reduce impacts on ungulate populations.

The Commission will also be asked to set coastal wild coho salmon seasons for coastal rivers. Wild coho fisheries have been proposed in 12 basins, in addition to Siltcoos and Tahkenitch lakes.

Under the proposed regulations, anglers will be able to harvest wild coho from the Tillamook, Nestucca, Siletz, Yaquina, Alsea, Siuslaw, Umpqua, Coos and Coquille rivers, Beaver and Floras creeks and Tenmile lakes (Siltcoos and Tahkenitch lakes remain open under permanent regulations).

Due to projected low returns, the Nehalem River would be closed to wild coho harvest in 2015, but anglers will be able to keep hatchery coho.

Daily and seasonal bag limits in open areas will be similar to recent years.  Because fewer Endangered Species Act (ESA) impacts are available in 2015, season lengths in some basins will be shortened compared to 2013 and 2014.  All proposed coho fisheries must be reviewed and approved by NOAA.

The 2015 Coastal Coho Fishing Regulations will be posted on the ODFW website after Commission approval.

For the first time in several years, there will be no emergency regulations for coastal fall Chinook. Anglers should refer to the 2015 Oregon Sport Fishing Regulations for those seasons.

In other business, the Commission will:
•Allocate 2016 big game raffle and auction tags among sportsman conservation groups and consider funding for A and H projects that provide hunting access or improve wildlife habitat.
