"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Oregon Reproductive Health Program,,11/23/2020 10:00:00 AM,11/23/2020 10:00:00 AM,"VIA CONFERENCE CALL: 1-877‐848‐7030, access code: 2030826# ", Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Public Health Division is proposing to permanently adopt and repeal Oregon Administrative Rules in chapter 333, division 004 related to Oregon Reproductive Health Program certification of participating agencies and coverage of reproductive health services.

In January 2018, the Oregon Reproductive Health Program (RH Program) adopted rules to establish the coverage of all services provided under the RH Program, including those detailed in HB 3391 (Oregon Laws 2017, chapter 721), those covered by the state’s family planning Medicaid waiver program Oregon ContraceptiveCare or CCare, and the state’s Title X grant. Since then, a number of changes, including the state’s withdrawal from the federal Title X program and changes to program requirements, have necessitated significant revisions to the adopted rules. To implement these changes, the Oregon Reproductive Health Program proposes to adopt new rules (OAR 333-004-3000 through 333-004-3240) to integrate the program’s existing Oregon ContraceptiveCare administrative rules (333-004-0000 through 333-004-0230) and Reproductive Health Program administrative rules (333-004-2000 through 333-004-2192) and clarify program certification requirements and coverage of reproductive health services. Once the new rules have been adopted, the existing rules referenced above will be repealed on April 15, 2021. This will allow agencies contracted with the RH Program under OAR 333-004-0000 through 333-004-2192 a sufficient period of time to become certified under the newly adopted rules.  A crosswalk has been developed to compare the new proposed OARs (333-004-3000 through 333-004-3240) with the current OARs that will be repealed (333-004-0000 through 333-004-2192). The crosswalk is available at the website referenced below. Please note: to correct a typo, the “and” in OAR 333-004-3050(2)(d) will be changed to “or” in the final, filed rules.

The proposed permanent rules pertain to program requirements for agencies certified with the Oregon Reproductive Health Program for the provision of clinical services, client eligibility and enrollment requirements for the Reproductive Health Program Access Fund, and covered services under the Reproductive Health Program Access Fund.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many Oregon hospitals revised their visitor policies in order to help protect the health of patients, providers, and staff. The visitor restrictions revealed the need to clarify the difference between visitors and support persons and as a result, SB 1606 was passed during the 2020 Special Session. 

These proposed rules clarify the policy and patient notification requirements; specify that a hospital may not condition the provision of treatment on a patient having a POLST, an advance directive, a form appointing a health care representative, or any instruction relating to the administration, withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures; and require a hospital to conduct a clinical care conference for patients admitted to psychiatric units or for patient's whose request to allow a support person in an operating room, procedure room or other restricted area of the hospital is denied.

In response to passage of HB 2011 (Oregon Laws 2019, chapter 186), the EMS and Trauma Systems program is amending the continuing education requirements in Appendix 1 to include one hour of cultural competency education for Emergency Medical (EMR) and two hours of cultural competency education for Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), Advanced EMTs, EMT Intermediates (EMT-I) and Paramedics. 

Additional changes include requiring an EMR to have two hours of education on pediatric and obstetric emergencies instead of one hour and eliminating the 'Education Topics Approved by the Medical Director' which was creating confusion for an unaffiliated EMS provider. The 'Miscellaneous EMS Topics' section has increased hours due to removal of the topics approved by an EMS Medical Director, but the overall hours required to renew an EMS provider's license remains the same. Appendix 2, which applies a more equitable distribution of continuing education credit requirements for EMRs and EMT-Is when their initial license has less than 24 months before the license expires, has also been amended to align with the changes in Appendix 1.

The infectious disease and accompanying social distancing measurements have made certain application and program requirements more difficult or impossible to implement.  The proposed rule adjusts program requirements to facilitate both patients’ applications and OMMP’s review and approval process of applications. 

The proposed rule provides more time in the application process for patients to submit the required medical documentation and allows patients, caregivers, or growers more time to submit additional or missing information to the Authority. It allows OMMP to accept government ID cards that expired in 2020 whenever the current rules require a valid government ID to be submitted, due to the expected difficulty in renewing government identification cards during the pandemic. The proposed rule allows OMMP to accept un-notarized documents that current rule requires notarization. The proposed rule is scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2021 because the Program expects that the difficulties described above will have lessened or ceased by that time.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing - Oregon Medical Marijuana Program,,11/18/2020 10:00:00 AM,11/18/2020 10:00:00 AM,VIA CONFERENCE CALL: 1-877-873-8017 Access: 767068#, Portland,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority, Public Health Division, Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) is proposing to permanently amend and repeal administrative rules in chapter 333, division 7 and division 64. 

Proposed changes clarify testing standards and laboratory accreditation standards. In addition, revisions to the rules are being made to align with changes that occurred in chapter 333, division 8 and chapter 845, division 25 in earlier rulemakings. Lastly, these rule changes allow the Oregon Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (ORELAP) to have more flexibility in their operations so that laboratories may maintain their accreditation when a declaration of emergency in Oregon is issued. The rule changes and a full summary of changes can be found on healthoregon.org/ommprules

In addition, rule changes include repealing labeling rules found under chapter 333, division 7. Due to Senate Bill 1057, passed in the 2017 legislative session (Oregon Laws 2017, Chapter 183), the cannabis labeling authority was transferred from OHA to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC). Labeling rules under OHA are being repealed since these rules are no longer in effect. OLCC labeling rules may be found in OAR 845-025-7000 through 845-025-7190.

Rules related to adding heavy metal testing, mycotoxin testing, and testing for inhalable cannabinoid products that were discussed during the rule advisory committee (RAC) meetings are not being adopted at this time. Instead, these topics will be further discussed with a workgroup. More information on the workgroup may be found at healthoregon.org/ommprules

In response to revised construction standards adopted by the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services (CAAS) and the National Fire Protection Association, the Authority is revising its ambulance construction criteria to align with these national standards. Additionally, the Authority is adopting by reference, the standards adopted by CAAS for remounting an ambulance vehicle for purposes of patient and EMS provider safety. Terms have been updated and a definition for ‘previously operated ambulance’ has been added for clarity. Based on inquiries from the industry, rules have also been added to clarify requirements for reserve ambulance vehicles and whether a licensed ambulance vehicle can be loaned to another licensed ambulance service agency. 

The Authority is also adopting rules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that clarify  it is a violation for a licensed ambulance service agency to not comply with a Governor's Executive Order and any guidance issued by the Authority as a result of an Executive Order. The Authority may investigate such actions and potentially take licensing action. Additionally, it is expected that licensed EMS providers also comply with Governor's Executive Orders and any subsequent guidance. Failure to comply with such orders could be considered conduct or practice contrary to recognized standards of ethics and as such an EMS provider could be subject to an investigation and possible disciplinary action.
