Agriculture Department,Proposed Rulemaking Hearing,Increase fees related to audit and third-party certification services,04/30/2012 01:00:00 PM,04/30/2012 04:00:00 PM,Oregon Department of Agriculture building, Salem,OR,"Federal-State Cooperative Agreement with USDA requests that fees charged for audit services conducted under that agreement follow the current federal rate, currently at $92/hr. OAR-603-053 currently puts the Oregon Department of Agriculture out of compliance with this agreement. Increased revenue generated from this fee increase will help pay for administrative costs of the program, as well as yearly continuing education for auditors and accreditation and audit fees for certification programs.

The ODA proposes a revised fee schedule as follows: change the minimum hourly charge from $75 to $92, with a 4 hour minimum of service. Additionally, it proposes application fees for the National Organic Program certification program at $250 for new organic applicants and $100 yearly renewal application fee for returning customers to cover the administrative cost and accepting and reviewing organic applications before inspection and audit fees can be billed. Additionally, as the Department has begun to offer Global Food Safety Initiative benchmarked audits, a certification fee is proposed to be charged per certificate to cover technical review and administrative costs of this program.","through May 14, 2012, 5:00 PM",Sue Gooch,503-986-4583,sgooch@oda.state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The committee will meet from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Umpqua Discovery Center located at 409 Riverfront Way in Reedsport. The agenda includes reports on STEP activities and projects, program updates and review of mini-grant applications. The meeting is open to the public.

The Committee also will review a proposal to renew the Gardiner-Reedsport-Winchester Bay STEP propagation program. Any STEP project that rears fish for release (including egg incubation) must be approved by ODFW. Part of the approval process includes public input and review by the Advisory Committee.

The proposals are available for public review on the ODFW website at http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/STEP/ and members of the public will be able to comment on the proposals at the meeting or in writing. Written comments are due by April 9.

The Oregon Legislature created STEP in 1981 to provide a way for volunteers to participate in the restoration of native stocks of salmon, steelhead and trout. Since then, thousands of volunteers have donated money, materials, equipment and countless hours of labor to improving Oregon fisheries. 

The STEP Advisory Committee makes recommendations to ODFW and the Fish and Wildlife Commission on issues regarding its programs. The committee’s 13 members are appointed by the Governor and represent all areas of Oregon.

"Marine Board, State",Rule Hearing 250-020-0221 and 250-030-0030,Rulemaking corrects alleged procedural irregularities related to rules prohibiting internal combustion motorboats/floatplanes on Waldo Lake. ,04/10/2012 06:00:00 PM,,"Willamalane Park & Recreation   District, Willamalane Center   Ken Long Rm.  250 S 32nd St.  ", Springfield,OR,"The agency proposes to re-adopt OAR 250-020-0221 and 250-030-0030 in order to correct alleged procedural irregularities related to their previous adoption. Those rules implement the Oregon Scenic Waterway Act by prohibiting internal combustion motorboats and floatplanes on Waldo Lake, a statutorily designated state scenic waterway, in order to preserve the natural setting of Waldo Lake, minimize disturbance of its natural beauty, protect its aesthetic values, and provide an unimpaired quality of recreational experience. An exception is provided in the rules for official governmental use and emergency landings of floatplanes. 

In a rule challenge pending in the Oregon Court of Appeals, Columbia Seaplane Pilots Assoc. v. State Marine Board, Oregon Court of Appeals Case No. A148192, certain procedural irregularities have been alleged, including the assertion that the fiscal impact statements for the challenged rules were inadequate. In order to provide an opportunity to correct the alleged procedural irregularities related to the previous rule adoption, the agency is initiating further rulemaking to enable the Board to take action on the basis of new fiscal impact statements and other relevant information. Such action could potentially take the form of re-adopting the rules, amending the rules to modify the prohibition of internal combustion motorboats and floatplanes on Waldo Lake, or repealing the rules.",yes,June LeTarte,,osmb.rulemaking@state.or.us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
