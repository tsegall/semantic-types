Adrian,Levick,audy27@gmail.com,,Oregon,"The prolonged periods of smokiness in Portland and Eugene are exposing millions of residents to extremely poor air quality and smoke related health hazards annually, due to poor forest management and a public fear of controlled burning. Studies show these controlled burns do not lower air quality like a wildfire. Residents who live in secluded parts of the woods without adequate escape routes should know the risk that they are taking and have no right to affect policy that would improve quality of life and life expectancy for millions of residents in urban zones. Protecting the rights of relatively wealthy landowning people at the expense of diverse and lower income populations in urban zones is at best problematic and at worst emblematic of this region's history of systemic racism. My complaints are that the majority of people who this will affect will never see this announcement or have the opportunity to express their support. My complaint is that too often policy is built on comment instead of prevailing scientific evidence. This has taken at least 30 years too long. Make the changes, make them now, and please tell the wealthy owners of homes in vulnerable areas that they are fully capable of paying to add exit routes, etc, and we the people of urban zones will no longer choke on pollution they are complicit in creating.",

Gabi,Ford,gabiford@hotmail.com,,OR,Yes to more controlled burns during the rainy season.,
Ted,Reiss,oregonrice@gmail.com,Self,Oregon,I am supportive of these changes to the ODF Smoke Management Plan. As a professional forester in Oregon experienced in forest management and fire fighting I see the need for increased flexibility to conduct prescribed burning in Oregon to help subdue the opportunity for wildland fire. Not all fire will be eliminated by proactive wildfire fuel reduction efforts. But many fires will burn less intense sending out less smoke during the summer and allowing wildland fire professionals better opportunity to control them. A smoke management system as described here will allow for more opportunity while keeping our air healthy. This is a positive change in ODF rules that should be lauded as an example for others to follow.,
Anne,Clarke,alizettigardens@gmail.com,,OR,Controlled burns during optimal weather is infinitely superior to the unknowns wildfire risks both in terms of healthy/ safety and of the costs incurred.,
Adam,Stinnett,astinnett@senecasawmill.com,Seneca Jones Timber,OR,I believe it’s time to make a change to the Oregon Smoke Management Plan. This proposed rulemaking is an excellent plan for moving forward. By providing flexibility for forest land owners to do prescribed burning while protecting public health is a win-win for everybody. Removing excess fuels protects our forests from catastrophic fires that release millions of tons of pollution. This common sense approach accomplishes this goal. ,
Geoff,Weaver,goweaver76@gmail.com,n/a,Oregon,"Let's use common sense here rather than antiquated notions of fire suppression and unwillingness to see smoke in our skies. To limit smoke beyond state and federal clean air guidelines (e.g. visible smoke) and thus prevent or limit controlled burns that we so desperately need is incredibly short sighted and counterproductive. Those who want to limit the smoke and thus the implementation of controlled burns will suffer far worse smoke from the higher intensity wildfires that result from decades of fire suppression. And their short sightedness will inflict this impact on others who will suffer because of this lack of common sense. Look at the science - without controlled burns and in the face of climate change driven hotter, drier weather patterns we are doomed to larger and more frequent wildfires and the resultant plumes of smoke. It will take decades or even generations to right the past mistakes of fire suppression. We need to be tackling this problem today in a substantial and urgent manner so that our children or at least our grandchildren don't suffer the consequences of our short sightedness today. ",
Lisa,Foster,lfosterk@gmail.com,,OR,"I am concerned about future large wildfires and so, I support prescribed burning prevention measures.

Doug,Viner,shaggydoug@earthlink.net,,OR,"Regarding wildfire smoke, I strongly support *long term* approaches to this increasingly important issue.

The trajectory of such short-sighted action is not good.",
malcolm,drake,jumpoffjoe@roguelinkdsl.com,oregon,,"  I am commenting on Smoke Management 2018 Rulemaking These proposed new rules (weakening air quality standards) would make a bad situation even worse. There are better ways to deal with overgrown forests.   PROBLEMS WITH PROPOSAL  The following statement, supposedly a ""solution"", appears to be short-sided: “(State Forester) Daugherty said in some cases, the new standards could be breached for one-hour periods in communities particularly vulnerable to wildfire if they develop programs to protect vulnerable populations. This includes such steps as providing community warnings of prescribed fires and indoor locations providing filtered air.""  First off, ""one-hour""? Since when can smoke levels be predicted with that kind of accuracy?   Secondly, ""Vulnerable populations”? Cities throughout Oregon already regulate woodsmoke, since it’s unhealthy to ALL populations"". We have had smoke warnings of ""unhealthy"", or worse, in areas all over the state, especially in SW areas of the state. Smoke is HAZARDOUS. When smoke is present, it WILL affect our fellow citizens.   Thirdly, this statement does not address people who HAVE TO BE outside all day, or parts of days, in order to earn a living. Examples-and I'm sure we can think of others, if we put our minds to it-are farm workers; carpenters, roofers, masons, and others in the building trades; landscape workers; surveyors, road construction workers; house painters; park rangers; life guards; hydrologists/hydrologic technicians; UPS drivers; US Postal Service workers.  These people cannot simply stop working, and race over to a building with filtered air. As a former carpenter/framer/general contractor, I can tell you how hard it would be to do so, even for one hour. We could le never simply leave a building site unattended, even for one hour. Tools and materials tend to grow legs! And does the mail carrier simply stop delivering mail on smoky days?   ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS  Alternative 1.  A)Fight fires as we’ve done for over 100 years; readopt the USFS mantra “Every Fire Out By 10:00(a.m.)”.   B) Increase readiness, increase standby fire fighting forces and equipment. Reinstate Smoke Jumpers bases. Hit fires hard and fast!  C)Allow commercial trees to naturally overtake brush species; the forest will eventually recover from excess brush, if we allow commercial trees to grow, and not be killed by fires. When forests become overstocked with timber species, do some commercial thinning.   D)Outlaw clear cutting, at least in dry areas, e.g. SW Oregon forests, where clearcuts almost always result in highly flammable  brushfields.   E) Harvest only percent of forest canopy which can be harvested without resulting in brushfields.  Alternative 2.    A)  Everything in Alternative 1.   B) Also, utilize wood chippers, slash-busters, etc. to turn  undesirable understory species into mulch. Mulch -unlike fires-adds nutrients to soil, keeps soil cooler, and retains soil  moisture, all of which increase rate of tree growth.   C) Utilize lop-and-scatter in areas inaccessible to slash-busters, wood chippers, etc.  Alternative 3   A)  Everything in Alternative 1.   B) Utilize Slash-Busters, Bulldozers, and/or firefighters to cut  strategic firelines, for use in future wildfires. (NOT like the excessively wide fire lines used on the Biscuit Fire, the Taylor Creek Fire, the Klondike Fire, etc.)   Alternative 4)  A) Utilize/pay suitable prisoners who volunteer to clear brush using various hand tools.   B) Require suitable recipients of unemployment insurance to work at clearing brush, in order to continue receiving benefits, while paying them a ""living wage"". ",

Angelina,McClean,eena_b@hotmail.com,,Oregon,"Thank you for considering the need for more prescribed burns in our forests. As a resident of the Rogue Valley, I can say communities are suffering from the extreme wildfires and unhealthy air quality. We need more prescribed burns in our forests to help them be more resilient during fire season. Decades of fuel build up after initial intense logging has left our forests lacking in large, fire resistant trees, and choked with very small trees and fuels. Allowing more prescribed burns is a much needed step in our desire for healthy, resilient forests.In Ashland, prescribed burns and the small amount of smoke they produce is a small trade off for the increased forest health and peace of mind of the citizens. Thank you.",

David,Powell,dlpowell@eoni.com,Citizen,Oregon,"I support the proposed rule revisions, and I support additional use of prescribed fire as a forest management tool. As a member of Eastern Oregon Climate Change Coalition, a 501c3 nonprofit group, I know that eastern Oregon's fire seasons have experienced a significant trend of increasing temperatures during the summer months, and this trend is projected to worsen in coming decades as the climate continues to change. As fire seasons lengthen with warming temperatures, then periods during the year when prescribed fire would be suitable may become fewer. This means that it is even more important to have smoke management rules supporting use of prescribed fire because weather windows in which to use it will be smaller.",
Rick,Sohn,Rsohn@umpquacoquille.com ,Self,Oregon,Any and all rule changes which lengthen the burning season in both the spring and the fall and allow more fuel to be consumed in prescribed fire.  Especially in fires associated with eco- silvicultural harvest or industrial harvest are welcome by me. The more we can reduce fuels especially in dry forest areas the better and the minor smoke intrusions from prescribed fire are far far overshadowed by the heavy intrusions in the summer.  Public acceptance of smoke is going to have to happen one way or another but there will be much fewer repercussions from prescribed fire than wildfire.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.,

Marie,Reeder,reederm2000@yahoo.com,,OR,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment.  Increasing prescribed burning into Oregon's forest is our best opportunity to reduce the hazardous air quality that results from large wildland fires.  As a resident of southern Oregon, I believe that smoke from wildland fires is the most oprressive effect of climate change that we are now experiencing.  For the past 3 summers, August has become a new season to restrict outdoor activity.  I teach a summer field biology class for the local high school, and have had problems with student exposure to smoke (and this year, evacuations due to wildfires).  July and August should be the prime months for outdoor activities, so this seems particularly offensive. Besides educational events, tourism and even farmstands are negatively impacted by many weeks of unsafe air.  My husband is exposed to unhealthy particulates every working day during smoke season, and suffers from coughing, inflamed eyes, and an increased susceptibility to bronchitis.  As a result,we're both very concerned and believe that the best solution is increased opportunities for sontrolled burns during the winter and spring.  We live less than a quarter mile from the Garner Fire complex lines and know first hand how brushy and overly dense our watershed has become.. Although we applaud the work done along roadsides and close to residential areas for fuel reduction, we have also seen how quickly brush such as poison oak grows back in after that expensive treatment is completed.  So as taxpayers as well as citizens who have health concerns with smoke, we feel that increased fire prescriptions are necessary.  I do think that language addressing watershed health should be added to balance the emphasis on maximizing burning for commercial timber management.  I'm not convinced that huge slash piles that result from clearcuts are beneficial either for the soil, air quality, or reducing the wildfire risks for large plantations of young trees.  ",

This is a necessary component of healthy ecosystems in the Western U.S. backed by thousands of years of traditional indigenous ecological knowledge as well as modern science.

They adequately address community concerns regarding air quality by providing a clarified definition of “smoke intrusion” based on the amount of measurable pollutants over time (rather than a simple presence/absence test over the course of an hour).  The community notification provisions and involvement of health authorities convince me that these changes will lead to a net decrease in the amount of smoke Oregonians have to breathe over the long term. I am curious as to why the removal of this section is proposed: “In addition, the rules apply to forestland outside any forest protection district in Oregon as described by ORS 527.620(7) at the discretion of the Oregon Department of Forestry and Department of Environmental Quality defined in a joint agreement.”",

Mark,Smolenski,mcsmo@earthlink.net,,Oregon,"I am in complete support of the modifications, but actually think they do not go far enough to enable prescribed burns to reduce potential wildfire fuels.  Smoke and particulates from wildfires dramatically exceed these levels for days and weeks during the season.  There is little to indicate the number and scale of wildfires is going to diminish going forward.  By comparison, the smoke from prescribed burns is relatively inconsequential.  Ben Franklin's aphorism got this one right: ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""  We actually need much more aggressive fuel reduction management, and modified regulations to make that possible.",
John,Anastasio,Elevation2043@gmail.com,none,OR,"I’m concerned that in our haste to lessen wildfires and smoke, we have begun a type of mass hysteria or collective obsessional delusional behavior.  If you step back and think about it, forest thinning or slash-and-burn as we used to say or logging the watershed plans that are being put forward as a solution to wildfire is the same as spreading out the burning to year around so that the smoke is diluted and that when the forest conflagration does come it burns a little slower. Perhaps. There are scientific studies that show that this unnatural management actually makes things worst. But leaving that argument aside, what this scenario leaves out is that we are not living in the 1960s.  Climate scientists say we are already in human-caused climate change now and the increased temperatures and drought we are suffering now are a major cause of the horrific wildfires burning here in the West. The scientists further say that to have any chance for our society to survive, we can’t put ANY MORE carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Forest thinning does the opposite of that. Get your mind around that - if we go forward with this we are guaranteeing our demise.   Fine, you say. What do you propose?   Are starters and at a minimum, I propose that our elected representatives as an emergency measure NOW in a bi-partisan effort triple current funding for firefighting efforts: tripling the number of firefighters on the ground and in the air who are dedicated to one thing - putting fires out as soon as they start. And in their downtime they can plant more trees to put oxygen back into the air.  And how do we pay for this? How about instead of paying for a 14th aircraft carrier at $13 billion we shift the money to this? How about taking back the $1.5 trillion tax break we gave to the already richest people in the world?",
Robert,Price,pricerip@gmail.com,retired,Oregon,"More than 30 years of field experience have taught me:    Habitat restoration involving controlled burns result in unacceptable atmospheric conditions during the early years. But, as the process evolves over time the controlled burns become cleaner, easier to control, and much less intense by various measures.    Fire Science is Complex in its Details (I am not a biologist) but Straightforward Conceptually (I am a physicist).    Selective Thinning and Prescribed Burns designed to create a resilient, sustainable ecosystem are feasible, desirable, and imperative as a response to the ongoing disastrous Anthropogenic Climate Change.    Industry-Oriented Harvesting and Cropping Practices have been undeniable failures creating conditions that intensify forest fires into conflagrations killing rather than reinvigorating our vital forest ecologies.    A variegated population unique to each part of the ecology is vital … literally. Only with well vetted science and proper funding will we be able to reverse decades of malpractice and economic greed.

Kaylea,Kathol,,,OR,"I strongly support revision of OAR 340-200-0040 in order to facilitate more controlled burning.  A nominal and manageable amount of smoke during the cooler seasons is a very small price to pay in exchange for unhealthy volumes of smoke and unmanageable wildfires during the summers.  Further, I believe additional controlled burns will not only contribute to long-term achievement of DEQ’s air quality standards, but will also contribute to the long-term achievement of DEQ’s water quality standards as they pertain to sediment and turbidity.  We’ve certainly learned by now that destructive wildfires denude the landscape and ultimately contribute to landslides and smaller-scale mobilization of sediment from uplands into Waters of the State.

The 2018 fire season shows yet again that we need to increase the use of prescribed fire on our forested landscapes, especially near our homes and communities. A rule change that facilitates more prescribed burning across land ownerships will reduce the amount of fuels contributing to large scale intense wildfires. Prescribed fire provides an essential tool to take proactive steps to reduce the fire hazard around communities and restore forest conditions, especially in light of climate change. I support the work by ODF and DEQ in providing public meetings and comment opportunities. I support the agencies work to align Oregon’s Smoke Management Rules with the Clean Air Act 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). It is important to maintain a balance between public health and reducing fire hazards in the lands that surround our homes and communities. I am concerned that the proposed 1-hour threshold limits the amount of prescribed burning conducted. This will impose unnecessary restrictions on critical prescribed burning priority areas that are most vital to reducing smoke effects from wildfires here in Southwest Oregon. I support a clear, simple, and attainable process to obtain an exemption from the 1-hour smoke threshold when communities have implemented a smoke communication and mitigation plan. Many of the fire prone forests of southern Oregon are arranged in a checkerboard ownership pattern with industrial land interwoven with Southern Oregon BLM Lands. Industrial timber plantations have been proven by science to burn faster, hotter, leading to more smoke production than natural forests. In addition to increasing prescribed fire and slash disposal, ODF should consider rules to ensure that private industrial forest practices do not increase future fire hazards and smoke production by limiting clearcutting and the production of activity slash. Also, aerial herbicides application and the practice of “hack and squirt” can cause widespread hardwood die-off, leaving senescent, dry vegetation on site and increase fire hazards on the landscape. I support the development of a community response plan that works with the community to determin its contents. We support the objectives of notifying residents of (1) the purpose and importance of prescribed burning, (2) the health risks of wildfire and prescribed fire smoke, (3) how local officials and the public can find out about daily burn plans and emission reduction actions in their area, and (4) notification of smoke anticipated entering into specific sensitive smoke areas. I would like to see ODF, DEQ, and federal agencies do an assessment of kraft paper as an alternative to polyethylene plastic for curing burn piles. Kraft paper is a cleaner, less toxic burning alternative. Burning polyethylene is a health hazard to crews and the public. We can reduce public health impacts and encourage prescribed burning by using slash paper instead of polypropylene to keep slash piles dry before their ignition date. I would also like to see ODF encourage the production of biochar in project as this method of burning can store far more carbon. As the affected public I have a vested interest in providing these comments to influence when and to what degree the lands within Southwestern Oregon will burn. Using prescribed fire in forest restoration projects under the correct weather conditions will allow smoke to penetrate into the atmosphere and not remained trapped, as it often does in the Summer months. I would like ODF and DEQ to fund more weather balloon launches on burning days to help accurately understand the burning conditions of the geographically complex and rigid mountains and valleys of southern Oregon. A balloon launch from a single point in Medford is unlikely to provide substantive data to be able to accurately identify favorable atmospheric conditions for prescribed burning opportunities for the Applegate Valley, or the Upper Rogue, or the Illinois valley. I believe the short term impacts of prescribed fire will be far less than the smoke impacts of wildfire during hot and dry conditions when atmospheric temperature inversions trap smoke in the valley.

Robert,Simpson,sambones@mind.net,Retired,Oregon,"Industry led harvesting and cropping practices don’t seem to be invigorating our vital forest ecologies. Together with current warmer and drier summers they have created conditions that intensify forest fires. And esthetically and effectively, clearcutting clearly is not a good solution.  Citizens, forest industry and government bodies in charge of forests, all need to take this opportunity to cooperate to manage the forests with the realities of a warmer, drier climate and potentially ever-increasing fires foremost. This will cost everyone something.  Citizens must understand that preventive burnings may be one of the solutions chosen. Care can and must be taken to minimize the possibility that smoke will accumulate in populated areas with the burns. Industry must harvest trees with both forest preservation and fire suppression a priority. And forest governing bodies must manage forests with preservation and fire and smoke suppression the priority, and, since industry will naturally consider profits first, tree harvesting for profit must be only a secondary consideration.",

Please avoid tangled bureauocratic issues that divert from the very needed effort:  allow very much more prescribed burning, please!   ...And force/require commercial logging companies to prescribe burn their lands much more timely.

Jamie,Morrison,,,Oregon," I am writing to express my broad support in the proposed rule changes to OAR 629.   I strongly support the changes because it gives the reader a greater understanding of the benefit of prescribed burning.  A practice which I hope to see utilized as a tool to reduce unmarketable forest fuel from the Oregon landscape. The use of polyethylene sheeting in slash burning, as some environmentalists have opposed, is also broadly supported by me (and I identify as an environmentalist). The reasons I support the use of polyethylene sheeting to keep slash piles dry for prescribed burning is that: 1.	It is much safer to ignite these piles when all other fuels are damp from rain or snow, and the need to keep them dry until that time with polyethylene sheeting is a necessary move. 2.	An uncontrolled fire sparked by lightning or otherwise ignited can easily burn cars, farming equipment, homes or other buildings which all contain far worse chemicals and in vastly greater quantities.   My only concern would be for those employed in the close monitor of such slash burning and that adequate respiratory protections are in place to protect those workers.   The changes to the rule regarding smoke intrusions and incidents are all steps in the right direction.  I am in favor of the documenting requirements so that the plan can be reviewed after implementation and affected communities can review such records and better coordinate public awareness systems for those living near any prescribed burn that may be categorized as a SSRA.

I have hiked on trails as soon as they have been re-opened after a period of thinning and controlled burns, while some of the fires are still smoldering.  Such smoke is limited, doesn't seem to spread or cause the dense level of particulates that we citizens have experienced when smoke from wildfires roll into our city.  Despite controlled burns in our nearby forest being visible from downtown, I've never seen citizens wearing masks to protect their lungs from this distant smoke--quite the contrast to the preponderance of masks worn during wildfire ""season.""   I have appreciated being able to know when and where control burns are occurring because Ashland posts such news in the local newspaper (as well as signs at trailheads).  I'm confused by hourly restrictions being placed on prescribed burning.  With our longer and hotter and drier summer/fire season (and at times long dry spells during our winter season), we need less restriction and more encuragement for control burns.  While hiking, I've viewed many slash piles waiting their turn to be ignited and wondered why layers of plastic were being used in the drying process, as burned plastic would release toxins into the air.  I support such plastic being replaced by less toxin-producing materials.  I strongly support managing our forests during our moist seasons as one means for decreasing the number and severity of wildfires experienced during our dry and hot seasons.",
Mark,Hamlin,markwhamlin@gmail.com,Retired,OR,"As concerned citizen who lives in the Ashland/Medford air basin, I strongly support loosing the air quality regulations on prescribed burning.   While I've been aware of the need and the science for many decades, we are now in crisis and more intentional wet season burnig is the only viable way forward.     ve temperature inversions that trap smoke in the valley.  I'd probably recommend even more liberalization than what's anticipated.  Tolerating a little smoke in the wet season is much preferred to the air muck we've lived in the past two summers.

jasmine,patten,jasmine@jasminepatten.com,,OR,"● Humans have made fires worse. With decades of fire suppression and the creation of tree plantations, we need to restore our degraded forests. We are experiencing record breaking temperatures and drought. We need more science based restoration, which includes more prescribed fires during wetter seasons. ● Because wildfires typically burn during hotter, drier conditions than when prescribed fires burn, more vegetation is consumed by fire producing more emissions. Also, summer fires often occur during periods of atmospheric stability and thus air stagnation, trapping smoke close to the ground where it’s more likely to impact humans and less likely to be quickly carried away by higher altitude transport winds. ● Prescribed burning must be used in concert with strategic thinning to minimize fuel loads on public and private land. With decades of fire suppression and the creation of tree plantations, we need to restore our degraded forests. We need more restoration thinning, not more old growth logging. ● Fires are a natural part of typical dry Oregon summers. We won’t be able to stop all fires, but prescribed fire can help our communities build a better relationship with fire. ● We support the development of a community plan that explains the importance of prescribed burning to mitigate wildfire and wildfire smoke. This includes ample notification to the public of when prescribed burning is likely to occur, notification to vulnerable residents of the likelihood that there may be smoke from prescribed burning, and help implementing actions residents can take to reduce exposure. ● Many forests need restorati on. By thinning small trees, clearing brush, and intentionally setting controlled fires during wetter months when smoke won’t get trapped in valleys, we can reduce the threat of more severe fires in our increasingly hot, dry summers. This won't stop all wildfires, but it will create safer conditions for firefighters.",

Jan,Rice,janssigns@gmail.com,private citizen,Oregon,"To Whom It May Concern: Thank you ODF and DEQ for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Oregon Smoke Management Plan. The 2018 fire season shows yet again that we need to increase the use of prescribed fire on our forested landscapes, especially near our homes and communities. A rule change that facilitates more prescribed burning across land ownerships will reduce the amount of fuels contributing to large scale intense wildfires. Prescribed fire provides an essential tool to take proactive steps to reduce the fire hazard around communities and restore forest conditions, especially in light of climate change. I support the work by ODF and DEQ in providing public meetings and comment opportunities. I support the agencies work to align Oregon’s Smoke Management Rules with the Clean Air Act 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). It is important to maintain a balance between public health and reducing fire hazards in the lands that surround our homes and communities. I am concerned that the proposed 1-hour threshold limits the amount of prescribed burning conducted. This will impose unnecessary restrictions on critical prescribed burning priority areas that are most vital to reducing smoke effects from wildfires here in Southwest Oregon. I support a clear, simple, and attainable process to obtain an exemption from the 1-hour smoke threshold when communities have implemented a smoke communication and mitigation plan. Many of the fire prone forests of southern Oregon are arranged in a checkerboard ownership pattern with industrial land interwoven with Southern Oregon BLM Lands. Industrial timber plantations have been proven by science to burn faster, hotter, leading to more smoke production than natural forests. In addition to increasing prescribed fire and slash disposal, ODF should consider rules to ensure that private industrial forest practices do not increase future fire hazards and smoke production by limiting clearcutting and the production of activity slash. Also, aerial herbicides application and the practice of “hack and squirt” can cause widespread hardwood die-off, leaving senescent, dry vegetation on site and increase fire hazards on the landscape. I support the development of a community response plan that works with the community to determin its contents. We support the objectives of notifying residents of (1) the purpose and importance of prescribed burning, (2) the health risks of wildfire and prescribed fire smoke, (3) how local officials and the public can find out about daily burn plans and emission reduction actions in their area, and (4) notification of smoke anticipated entering into specific sensitive smoke areas. I would like to see ODF, DEQ, and federal agencies do an assessment of kraft paper as an alternative to polyethylene plastic for curing burn piles. Kraft paper is a cleaner, less toxic burning alternative. Burning polyethylene is a health hazard to crews and the public. We can reduce public health impacts and encourage prescribed burning by using slash paper instead of polypropylene to keep slash piles dry before their ignition date. I would also like to see ODF encourage the production of biochar in project as this method of burning can store far more carbon. As the affected public I have a vested interest in providing these comments to influence when and to what degree the lands within Southwestern Oregon will burn. Using prescribed fire in forest restoration projects under the correct weather conditions will allow smoke to penetrate into the atmosphere and not remained trapped, as it often does in the Summer months. I would like ODF and DEQ to fund more weather balloon launches on burning days to help accurately understand the burning conditions of the geographically complex and rigid mountains and valleys of southern Oregon. A balloon launch from a single point in Medford is unlikely to provide substantive data to be able to accurately identify favorable atmospheric conditions for prescribed burning opportunities for the Applegate Valley, or the Upper Rogue, or the Illinois valley. I believe the short term impacts of prescribed fire will be far less than the smoke impacts of wildfire during hot and dry conditions when atmospheric temperature inversions trap smoke in the valley. Prescribed burning can offset the amount of fuels available when wildfire does strike in subsequent years. Sincerely,Jan Rice",
katy ,mallams,july4.girl@yahoo.com,,OR,"I hope DEQ will loosen the rules AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE in southern Oregon to allow prescribed burning during the spring and fall.  the amount of smoke generated by prescribed burning is vastly preferable to what we experienced this summer.   Because we will keep having this smoke-filled summers if we don't get a handle on the fuel.  I know there are people who are much more sensitive to smoke than myself but living in southern Oregon means there will be smoke so we can lessen the impact if DEQ will allow more burning.  And its not just smoke -- there are significant impacts  to the forest as well with larger hotter fires, especially where they are reburning the same areas over and over.",

Emily,Coleman,emilycoleman72@gmail.com,Ms.,OR,"First, I am deeply concerned by the committee’s recommendation to revise the definition of smoke intrusion to “include a one-hour threshold at or above 70 ug/m3 and a 24 hour average at or above 26 micrograms per cubic meter, measured midnight to midnight on the first day of smoke entrance into a community.” Also, there is no regulation regarding the number of allowed smoke intrusion days. These changes in the rules potentially allow for hazardous air quality for longer than 24 hours and for any number of days.  According to the World Health Organizations Air Quality Guidelines for Particulate Matter, Ozone, Nitrogen, Carbon Dioxide and Sulfur Dioxide, “more than 2 million premature deaths each year can be attributed to the effects of outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (caused by the burning of solid fuels)”.  The people of Southern Oregon experienced weeks and weeks of unhealthy to hazardous air, many days it was the worst air quality on the planet. It would be egregious if the ODEQ and ODF allowed for an increase in hazardous emissions during seasons when we count on fresh, clean air, even in a perceived short term. The risk to public health is too great.  ",https://data.oregon.gov/views/t483-y97v/files/02e9915d-5858-41cb-8998-0e64d4aa5a92?filename=Letter+to+DEQ.docx

Lynda,Hathorn,lyndahathorn@gmail.com,,OR," At the Bend meeting in August, the facts about smoke effects on health are why I oppose changing the allowable smoke from slash burning.  I understand that thinning the forests is important, but there are other ways to deal with the material: chop it up, sell or  let people have the wood for wood fire.  There are too many days that people are stuck in their homes or outside in the smoke from wild fires endangering their health to add to those days and make the air pollution worse from slash burns does not make sense.
