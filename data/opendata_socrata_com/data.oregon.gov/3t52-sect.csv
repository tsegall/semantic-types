The permit incorporated new requirements based on rules adopted in 2009 and 2012. The May 1, 2014 permit contained new conditions that addressed the concerns that DEQ heard from the public at a public hearing held on Oct. 30, 2013 and during the public comment period which ended on Nov. 20, 2013. One condition that DEQ included in the permit was a composting pile height restriction limiting pile heights to 30 feet. On May 16, 2014 Grimm’s appealed the permit stating concern with the pile height restriction.  
As a result of the appeal, Grimm’s Fuel has been operating under an older, expired permit that remains in effect until DEQ issues a new permit. By proposing a revised permit, DEQ withdraws the permit issued on May 1, 2014. The proposed permit no longer contains a pile height restriction. Instead the proposed permit requires Grimm’s to monitor for the following parameters throughout the composting piles: oxygen level, temperature, moisture content, and retention time. The permit also requires an updated odor minimization plan. These permit requirements will more accurately demonstrate whether Grimm’s is meeting regulatory requirements than a permit condition that restricts composting pile height.

Discussion of the benchmark concentration of diesel particulate matter is scheduled to be discussed at the Feb. 17 ATSAC meeting.

For more information:  Go to Air Toxics Science Advisory Committee. Find the meeting agenda at committee meeting schedule. 

Background: The  Air Toxics Science Advisory Committee provides DEQ with advice on the state air toxics program, which aims to reduce toxic air pollutants that can cause serious health effects and damage the environment. The committee’s primary task is to review the state’s health-based air toxics benchmarks and update if necessary. The committee also eventually plans to review draft short-term guideline concentrations. 

Periodic updating of the air toxics benchmarks is important because the benchmarks serve as the foundation for evaluating and solving air toxics problems in Oregon. Committee members provide advice that is scientifically and technically sound, independent, balanced and timely. For information about committee members, go to Member Biographies.

After the Air Toxics Science Advisory Committee completes its review, it may propose changes to individual benchmarks. Any proposed updated benchmarks will go through a formal rulemaking process, with public notice, a public hearing and comment period later this year.",,"Sue MacMillan","503-229-6458","macmillan.susan@deq.state.or.us",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.deq.state.or.us/aq/toxics/meeting.htm (http://www.deq.state.or.us/aq/toxics/meeting.htm)"

DEQ and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are revising the 2006 Willamette Basin Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load, commonly called a TMDL, to meet a new mercury standard and meet a court-ordered deadline of April 2019. The TMDL is being updated to meet Oregon’s 2011 revised water quality criterion for methyl mercury, which is eight times more stringent
than the 2006 criterion. The goal of the revised TMDL is to reduce mercury in the Willamette Basin to levels allowing safe consumption of fish.

How do I participate?
This meeting is open to the public, however discussion is limited to advisory committee members only. Everyone will have an opportunity to provide written comment to DEQ during DEQ’s public review period, tentatively scheduled for November 2018.

DEQ is proposing to renew the permit which allows discharge of treated domestic effluent to the Umatilla River and the West Division Main Canal. 
The informational session will take place at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, June 6 in Eastern Oregon Higher Education Center Room 134 at Blue Mountain Community College, 975 SE Columbia in Hermiston.  
In 2014, the city upgraded its treatment plant at 2205 N. First Place. The upgrades included a new membrane bioreactor treatment process that provides an extremely high quality effluent, which is discharged just upstream from Three Mile Dam and the West Division Main Canal. The discharge to the canal will be available for farmers to use as irrigation water.
The proposed permit is more stringent than the previous permit. The city would discharge all of their effluent to the canal from April to October, rather than discharging to the Umatilla River during these times. Due to the treatment plant upgrades, pollutant discharges to the river from November through April will also be greatly reduced.  
In addition to attending the meeting, people can send written comments on the draft permit by 5 p.m. on Monday, June 13. Comments should be emailed to ray.jackie@deq.state.or.us or sent by mail to Jackie Ray, Permit Coordinator, 800 SE Emigrant Ave., Suite 330, Pendleton, Oregon, 97801.",,"Duane Smith","(541) 278-4607","smith.duane@deq.state.or.us",,,,,,,,,,

"Environmental Quality Dept.","Public hearing on a proposal to renew and modify the permit for Deer Pointe Meadows","The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality will hold a hearing on a proposal to renew and modify the permit for Deer Pointe Meadows to discharge wastewater to drainfields constructed at the manufactured home park. ","2017-09-20T18:00:00.000","2017-09-20T19:30:00.000","Rainier City Hall, 106 West B St."," Rainier","OR","The hearing will be held at 6 p.m. Sept. 20 at Rainier City Hall, 106 West B St.
The park, at 25231 Alderbank Street in Rainier, has applied for a Water Pollution Control Facilities Permit renewal and modification. 

DEQ issued warning letters to the current permit holder in January and March 2017 for discharging sewage onto the ground. The violations occurred with the remaining older septic system. 

In each case, short-term fixes were used to prevent further discharges.

The current application for a permit renewal and modification is intended to authorize a long-term solution resulting in one combined system that will be more manageable and that will include a high level of treatment to the wastewater before discharging to the drainfield. The deadline for completing this work is Sept. 30, 2017. 

The draft permit would allow an increase in the total wastewater flow to the system from the current 8,025 gallons per day to 12,000 gallons per day. Allowable effluent pollutant concentration limits are being reduced because the wastewater will be receiving a higher level of treatment before being discharged to the drainfield. Wastewater will also be disinfected to reduce pathogens before disposal.

DEQ will accept public comments on the proposal through Sept. 21 at 5 p.m.

House Bill 2017 (2017) directs DEQ to establish a program to provide rebates to Oregonians who purchase certain types of electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) and other qualifying zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs). There are two elements to the rebate program – conventional rebates for the purchase of a new electric vehicle, and a Charge Ahead rebate that provides rebates to low or moderate income households who purchase a new or used electric vehicle if they also meet other qualifying criteria.  At this time DEQ is developing rules to implement the program by establishing eligibility criteria, rebate amounts, and clarifying design features of the Charge Ahead rebate program.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality's Cleaner Air Oregon program recently completed a health risk assessment on potential air pollution from Elder Demolition, a facility that applied for an air quality permit to place a temporary portable incinerator in your community and future locations across Oregon.

Join us for a virtual meeting to discuss the Elder Demolition heath risk assessment for your community.

A representative from Elder Demolition will join us to provide an overview of their portable incinerator. This is a great opportunity to learn about the facility, review the Cleaner Air Oregon risk assessment results, and ask questions to DEQ and Oregon Health Authority staff.

Elder Demolition Risk Assessment

The Elder Demolition Risk Assessment Results meet Oregon standards that are protective of health. Risk assessments are estimates of people's increased health risk from living near a proposed facility and being exposed to a facility's emissions. These are done before DEQ issues the facility an Air Quality permit to ensure that its emissions will meet health standards.

Questions?

For questions on Cleaner Air Oregon or the Elder Demolition permit application, please contact the DEQ permit writer Weston Li

DEQ is evaluating high priority updates that will likely result in changes to 2022 Integrated Report Assessment Methodology. This is the first of several webinars on the Assessment Methodology update. This first webinar will focus on high-level discussions of the priorities for the Assessment Methodology update and opportunities for input on the methodologies.

The permit modification is needed because PGE’s coal-fired power plant closed in October 2020 and because the manufacturer of the facility’s natural gas turbine released new information that startup and shutdown emissions for two pollutants, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds are higher than originally estimated. The proposed permit modification does not change how much natural gas PGE uses or change the hours the plant can run.
How do I participate?
Attend the virtual public hearing to learn about the permit application, ask any questions you might have and provide verbal or written comments on the proposed permit.
