Keith ,Meyer ,kgm@proaxis.com,Private Citizen ,Oregon ,"Here is some feedback: 
â€¢Recommendations for prioritizing DEQ responses to odor nuisances.  Response - Having read the preamble report I would suggest that an alternative to evaluating just the number of complaints be used to ensure areas of lower population density are not ignored simply because the number of complaints is low.  Maybe some type of population density vs. complaint reports calculation to arrive at a way to rank the significance of the complaints relevant to the population density.  

 
â€¢Methods to determine what odor control measures are reasonable, including cost or other criteria.  Response - all significant organizations have trade organizations which work to support there industry.  I come out of the roofing industry and ARMA (Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing Association) is the trade organization that does all the research and work in support of that industry.  I believe all other industries have similar organizations and they in turn would be the most knowledgeable about processes and practices that work to abate odor (etc.) and the relevant costs associated with those processes. 

â€¢Ways to encourage early, rapid and informal resolution of odor nuisances.  Response - I good industry is proactive in achieving compliance once an issue has been raised with them.  The problem is the others -  The best method is to show them it can be done.  Therefore - 1. Provide appropriate industry trade organization information to them.   2. Contact other states for contact lists of specific industries in there states who have successfully dealt with the problem - pass on that information to the odor generator.  3. Do the same thing for in state industries.    ",
Lori,Luchak,lluchak@milesfiberglass.com,Miles Fiberglass & Composites ,Oregon ,"I believe there should be some type of a distinction of complaints for people who live by the odor as oppose to people who drive by or ride a bike by.

Stephanie ,Salisbury,boszesl@gmail.com,,Oregon,"1.  Prior to issuing air pollution permits to an entity, the potential for an odor nuisance should first be evaluated.  The result of that evaluation should be taken into strong consideration before the permit is approved.  I am a resident who has complained about odor nuisance from the Daimler truck facility (Swan Island) on multiple occasions and know at least several hundred other additional odor complaints have been filed with DEQ.  While the Daimler air emission permit is still under review, this would be an excellent opportunity to implement this procedure.  That is, please review (and hopefully enforce) the odor nuisance issue PRIOR to approving Daimlerâ€™s permit.  

2. It seems that DEQ should priority the investigation of odor nuisance complaints based on how many complaints they receive either for a particular odor emitter, or when the source  of emissions is not known, for a particular geographical area (where nuisance reports are coming from).  Less frequent complaints should also be evaluated, but with less of a sense of urgency than ones with numerous complaints.  This will hopefully direct DEQ resources towards the nuisances that are affecting the most people.

Adam,Bartell,Abbartell@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I am very thankful that DEQ is going to put in place a formal mechanism for the nuisance component of it's permitting procedure. But it should be noted that those permits with more Complaints should be prioritized before those with fewer complaints. If there is a threshold is used to determine which complaints become prioritized it should be a very low.

Do not set a particular threshold, but rather address complaints with the available resources, starting with the most frequently cited sites and then move down the list, ignoring no one.  I live in North Portland and we are assaulted with noxious odors on a regular basis, preventing us from enjoying a healthy relationship with our environment.  I am concerned for the children, in particular, as these odors contain chemicals that could affect their developing lungs and heart.

Bruce,Bartlett,bruce@actisdesign.com,Wash Co Citizen Participation Organization #1,Oregon,"These seem like appropriate and sound approaches to odor nuisances. Regarding compost odors, a primary problem is the requirement to site composting facilities in Industrial-zoned lands. This places it in urban settings where odor problems are multiplied. The importance of commercial-scale composting is critical to the fertility of agricultural lands and actually using/enhancing the land Oregon has protected through its land use process. I strongly urge a solution to the type of problem that Recology has in North Plains at the Nature's Needs composting facility (which makes the BEST, most active compost of any provider in the NW) by lobbying the legislature to permit commercial composting on ag lands in addition to industrial lands. It does not smell any worse than a dairy does. (Disclaimer: I chair CPO 1 but I am submitting this as an individual, not on behalf of CPO 1.)",
Leo,Leonardo,concordiasalus@hotmail.com,private citizen,Oregon,"â€œPermitted Burn Barrelsâ€&#65533;

I would like to add my two bits about the awful odor of backyard burn barrels.  This tends to be a community issue in that cities have choices about whether to allow this.  Big cities have ordinances, small towns allow burns barrels. This seems to be a small town solution to unwieldy garbage as there is often insufficient community recycling at curbside because of insufficient local funds. To go along with an absolute statewide ban on burn barrels, should be a coordinated statewide recycling effort at all curbs that have garbage pick-up.   I live in a small town and there is constant air pollution from locals who insist they have a â€œpermitâ€&#65533; from local agencies to burn trash in barrels.  The enormous quantity of plastic and laminates and chemicals which finds its way into these burn barrels, along with the wood, destroys the local air quality.  Burn barrels cook away regularly all summer all over town, from leaf burning to construction site materials incinerated in barrels, to plain old unsorted garbage. Where homes are closer together, these burn barrels are often within twenty or less feet of your windows, hence the acrid smell and particulate carbon seeps into every nook and cranny around windows and doors, affecting not only oneâ€™s ability to work in oneâ€™s own garden but also stinking up home interiors, contributing to asthma and really dirty air pollution. When one objects to this practice, people challenge you with, â€œWell, itâ€™s sure not as bad as the forest fires around here, they put a LOT more carbon in the air!â€&#65533; or â€œI have a permit!â€&#65533; This is a blatant sidestepping of the issue.  The fact remains that burn barrels stink and that the particulate matter they contribute to the air is toxic.

Larry,Dunlap,ldunlapmd@q.com,LRAPA Adv. Comm.  (Lane Co.),Oregon,The overall approach and reasoning appears sound and workable.  My concern is that DEQ did not consider any language to address complaints about odors that have persisted for years but are now the recipient of complaints because homes have been built closer to the source or simply because the public is newly aware that they can voice a complaint to a govt. agency.  Such cases seem to me to deserve a slower intervention when the complainer has knowingly placed themselves in an area of potential odors and then begun to initiate complaints about them.,
Lisa,Manning,pokman3@earthlink.net,Neighbors for Clean Air,Oregon,"Odor Nuisance Strategy Reporting recommendations!  
1. DEQ should prioritize investigation of complaints by number of complaints to get worst sources evaluated first!  There should be no threshold to instigate investigations! All complaints need to be evaluated even the low number complaints, but investigation priority should go to the pollution source with the most complaints first no matter what the total number of complaints!  2. The DEQ  should hold off on releasing Daimler's permit until they have tested out their nusiance strategy on Daimler and the numerous complaints that have been logged citing this industry!

Pamela,Allee,alleepa@gmail.com,NPAQ,Oregon,"I live in the St Johns area of North Portland, and have complained many times over the last several years about noxious odors - the sort that are not merely ""stinky"" but the ones that cause headaches and respiratory problems.  First:  We may not know the source of a particular air pollution problem; that's the DEQ's job.  Second:  there should be NO threshold of complaint numbers that will set off a real DEQ response.  Third:  DEQ MUST have more actual investigators and monitoring.  Otherwise, the entire burden of proof will be where it is now - on the public (see point number one).

Penny,Meiners,endlesssummer02@gmail.com,,OR,"Thank you for preparing this Proposed Odor Nuisance Strategy so quickly.  It appears well thought out, however I am concerned that you may still end up comparing apple to oranges.  I am particularly concerned that you do not use the framework you propose as a strict threshold for establishing an air emission as an odor nuisance.  If these are used as thresholds then the emissions from Daimlerâ€™s paint and Vigorâ€™s acrid machine shop oil, while adding to Portlandâ€™s overall poor air quality, might not meet the threshold of odor nuisances because they tend to be seasonal and wind directed with a limited range that affects only a few hundred neighbors and an small university.

I am also concerned about how DEQ will do the actual investigations and where the funding for the investigations will come from, in that the â€œenforcement divisionâ€&#65533; should ideally be separate from the â€œpermit divisionâ€&#65533;.

Finally much of your nuisance strategy is based on complaints filed by neighbors.  I would therefore like to request a more user friendly online complaint form; one that at the very least has an auto fill feature.  I am ashamed to say I have only filed a hand full of complaints rather than the several hundred I should have filed, simply because I am too busy or rather too lazy to fill out your current online form.

Ted,Saedi,atasaedi@hotmail.com,,OR,"Dear Sarah,

Thank you for taking the step to acknowledge the seriousness of odor problem and tackling the issue for the sake of livability in Oregon's neighborhood. 

Here are our comments to the Proposed Odor Nuisance Report:
1. The proposal seems to be more sympathetic to the source of odor than the population of complainers.
2. Has soft rules and initially is leaving it up to the goodwill and the voluntary action of the source.
3. Priority should be given to close proximity of residence to the source of odor and the repetition of the incident - number of complaints.
4. As far as how to gauge a bad odor, well, bad odor is bad odor, if people are bothered by the odor, then that should be a start for DEQ to investigate and put a stop to it. 

Regards, 
Ted Saedi and Virginia Green, residents of Tualatin",
Martha,Debry,martha@northplains.org,City of North Plains,OR,"The proposed strategy appears sound.

I am pleased to see that DEQ is recognizing that odor intensity scale is more practical than olfactometer (scentometer) readings.  As someone trained in the use of the scentometer, I agree that an odor can be smelled with the nose and be recognized as offensive,  while  it is not possible  to measure the odor with the equipment. 

It is my hope that a compost facility is considered to be different from a recycling facility.  

DEQ should ensure that regulatory standards for compost facilities are oriented to the site's proximity to a populated.  That is  to say a facility near residential properties should be subject to a more rigorous standard than a compost facility miles from a population center.  The cost of improvements should not necessarily  determine the ""reasonableness"" of a mitigation measure, as it should be absorbed into the cost of operations like other regulatory requirements.

Stakeholder involvement in the process is a good strategy.  While it is difficult to hear criticism of proposed plans, it is a necessary step in validating the process, and may help provide additional insight into an odor issue.

Kindest regards,
Martha DeBry

Each incidence of physical assault is different, so your reaction to the assault will vary.

In my opinion, it is never okay to exact physical revenge for a physical assault – “revenge” occurs after the incident is over and the victim feels angry and hurt and wants to make the attacker feel their pain.

I think you’re confusing Catholics (who are not biblical literalists) with some more modern, mostly U.S. based, sects.
