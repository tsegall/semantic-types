Brian ,Earls,brianhighlander@aol.com,Highlander Motel & RV Park dba Earls Shell,Oregon,I believe on a small owner-operated gas station like mine that a 20% increase is very steep considering the fact we cannot pass that cost along to the consumer easily in the price per gallon. I commented that this would be the exact situation we would be in when you first introduced this user fee and here we are again.  Pass this cost onto the oil companies or the middle man who can pass on cost directly so the  retailer does not have to eat the cost. If this is the route then you should base the fee on throughput so the smaller station owners does not have to burden a larger % of a burden then the a larger station.  A flat fixed fee increase across the board is unfair to small volume sellers on a percentage basis. ,

In addition, even the founder of Greenpeace has testified to the same. Why are you increasing funding to support your further oversight.",
Peter ,Nelson,pete@marcnelsonoil.com,Marc Nelson Oil Products,OR,"Like most petroleum distributors I have been in the business a long time.  I remember having to fill out the reports for the Air Contaminate discharge permits way back when.  I think back then the permit cost was $120.   For a period of time the department thought it wasn't necessary to issue the ACDP.  So they were done away with at least for petroleum distributor.  Then a few years back the DEQ brought the ACDP back at a price three times higher than it was previously.  
It leaves little doubt it my mind that you brought the permits back as a revenue driver for your already overstaffed organization.  Now you want to increase the fees after already having tripled them a few years back to add 3.67 full time positions.  For what???  You cancelled issuing the permits at one time so you must have thought the information you were getting as result of them was of little value.  So how can it be so much more valuable now???  In my opinion, it is a complete waste of time and resources to require petroleum jobbers to obtain this permit to operate a service station or cardlock.  Our emissions are so miniscule there is nothing to report on the annual reporting forms.  
The state of Oregon keeps taking and taking, I see very little value in return.  I don't think you guys have a clear understanding of the burden you impose on business owners.  There are numerous state and federal governmental departments that we have to satisfy with money and reporting. The amount of regulation and redundancy is ridiculous.  You know where I stand.  Catch a clue DEQ.

STeve,Johnston,stephen.d.johnston@saint-gobain.com,CertainTeed Roofing,Oregon,"1. I understand that this increase is already in affect, is this correct? 
2. What is the projected increase state wide for these changes in dollars? (ie: how much are we paying for the 3.67 positions)

Thank you. ",
