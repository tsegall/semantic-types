"Raspberry and Blackberry Commission, Oregon","2012 Caneberry Breeding Selections Evaluation","ORBC Meeting","2012-12-10T10:00:00.000",,"OSU Wiegand Hall"," Corvallis","OR","Colleagues - We are having the research evaluations of the USDA-ARS/OSU berry breeding selections in the upcoming weeks.  We are not looking to invite everyone in the world, but we are looking for anyone who knows berries and knows what the industry needs.  There will be two evaluation days:

Blackberries, Raspberries and Black Raspberries will be evaluated on Monday, December 10, starting at 10 am.

Strawberries and Blueberries will be evaluated on Wednesday, December 19, starting at 10 am.

You will be expected to evaluate over 100 IQF selections and cultivars.  We will be evaluating ALL the selections and varieties from the 2011 season, many from several harvest dates.  Results from this evaluation will be used to determine which cultivars and selections will be discarded and which will continue on in the breeding program. We will also decide which selections will be displayed at the Commission research meetings and at the Northwest Food Processors meeting.

The evaluation will be held in the OSU Food Science Department, Wiegand Hall, at the corner of 30th and Campus Way in Corvallis.  For those coming from I-5, take the Highway 34/Corvallis exit.  Head west on 34.  As you approach Corvallis, DO NOT TURN LEFT AT THE LIGHT to follow 34 toward the Coast.  Continue straight ahead and cross the river on the Harrison St. bridge.  Follow Harrison straight ahead to 30th St.  Turn left on 30th.  Continue 5 blocks; turn right on Campus Way.  The Food Science building will be on your right but turn left and park in the STUDENT PARKING section of the Crop Science lot.  It’s free!  

Chad will again be buying pizza for lunch.  No you can’t just come for lunch.

Questions?  Call me or email me.  See you here.

Thanks,

Workshop Overview: Oregon strawberries have always been known for their exceptional flavor. Historically they have been grown primarily for the processed market and Oregon harvested 19,000 acres of strawberries in 1957. Since then, acreage has steadily declined due to competition from other growing areas - there were 2,000 acres in 2012 with 80% destined to processed markets. However, recently there has been an increase in market demand for local, fresh, Oregon-grown strawberries and currently, there are not enough fresh acres harvested to fill demand. This is the first of two workshops the Oregon Strawberry Commission is sponsoring to introduce growers to Fresh Strawberry Market opportunities. Speakers will include growers, buyers, and researchers who will discuss fresh market strawberry varieties, the differences between processed and fresh production, harvest methods, and how to find opportunities for fresh market strawberry sales. Whether you already grow for the processed strawberry market, or don’t yet grow strawberries, you can benefit from learning about the potential market opportunities for growing fresh Oregon strawberries.

"Strawberry Commission, Oregon","2012 Strawberry Breeding Selections Evaluation","OSC Meeting","2012-12-19T10:00:00.000",,"OSU Wiegand Hall"," Corvallis","OR","Colleagues - We are having the research evaluations of the USDA-ARS/OSU berry breeding selections in the upcoming weeks.  We are not looking to invite everyone in the world, but we are looking for anyone who knows berries and knows what the industry needs.  There will be two evaluation days:

Blackberries, Raspberries and Black Raspberries will be evaluated on Monday, December 10, starting at 10 am.

Strawberries and Blueberries will be evaluated on Wednesday, December 19, starting at 10 am.

You will be expected to evaluate over 100 IQF selections and cultivars.  We will be evaluating ALL the selections and varieties from the 2011 season, many from several harvest dates.  Results from this evaluation will be used to determine which cultivars and selections will be discarded and which will continue on in the breeding program. We will also decide which selections will be displayed at the Commission research meetings and at the Northwest Food Processors meeting.

The evaluation will be held in the OSU Food Science Department, Wiegand Hall, at the corner of 30th and Campus Way in Corvallis.  For those coming from I-5, take the Highway 34/Corvallis exit.  Head west on 34.  As you approach Corvallis, DO NOT TURN LEFT AT THE LIGHT to follow 34 toward the Coast.  Continue straight ahead and cross the river on the Harrison St. bridge.  Follow Harrison straight ahead to 30th St.  Turn left on 30th.  Continue 5 blocks; turn right on Campus Way.  The Food Science building will be on your right but turn left and park in the STUDENT PARKING section of the Crop Science lot.  It’s free!  

Chad will again be buying pizza for lunch.  No you can’t just come for lunch.

Questions?  Call me or email me.  See you here.

Thanks,
