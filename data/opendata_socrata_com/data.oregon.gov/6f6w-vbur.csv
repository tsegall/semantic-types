patrick,murphy,sunrise3@coinet.com,,Oregon,"One thing this county does not need is an incfrease in fees and expenses for permits.    All this will accomplish is reduction in business and reduction in population and increased hardship on the citizens.  If your mandate for operation is important and necessary, then the running of the DEQ should be funded by the state.   If the state refuses to fund your work, then you need to downsize instead of loading more effective taxes on the citizenry.  

Just who in hell are you working for?  Bend and Redmond?  What agenda are you following?   It sure smacks of Agenda 21.

John,Huddle,john@johnhuddle.com,,Oregon,"I am opposed to any increase in fees. I am unconvinced that these are â€œfees for serviceâ€&#65533; but rather a tax. As fees increase, the likelihood that necessary repairs are made decreases. In addition, there are no provisions for sliding scale fees for those with restricted means. DEQ has failed to take leadership to address rising costs to homeowners in rural areas. It is our rural communities that have a disproportionate amount of poverty. Please do not raise fees related to septic system installation, maintenance or repair.",
Robert,Barnes,kingspumping@gmail.com,King's Pumpng Service,OR,"My first question is does the increased Sewage Disposal License fee only apply to licensed pumpers and not to installers or O&M licensees? If so why is there not corresponding fee increases with these categories as well? There appears to be as much enforcement action with illegal installers as there is with pumpers so I would ask that if fees need to increase, they be done in all the On-Site licensing and certification areas, not just pumpers.

Thank you for the opportunity to give feedback.

seo,http://www.SeoAnalyticNews.com/,rsizldtd@gmail.com,seo,seo,"Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.SeoAnalyticNews.com"">Seo Plugin</a>",
