I am pleased to share that we are hosting an informational meeting on the Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) on Thursday, July 1st at 11am. During this call, staff will be available to provide updates on the HAF planning and programming process and receive additional input.
 
To Register for the Zoom Meeting:

Through HAF, Oregon will receive about $90 million to assist homeowners whose pandemic-related financial hardships have caused or increased a risk of mortgage delinquency or foreclosure, displacement, or loss of utilities, energy, or broadband services. Treasury requires OHCS to complete planning and engagement to evaluate the needs of Oregon homeowners. OHCS has listened to its housing partners and several committees and is excited to provide an update on the development of Oregon’s HAF mortgage assistance program.
 
At this meeting OHCS will provide an update on: OHCS’ plans for its initial $9 million in HAF funding; the HAF planning process to date; and the broad strokes of the mortgage reinstatement and assistance program design. In addition to an opportunity for discussion on those points, or to provide written feedback, OHCS hopes to collect feedback on lessons learned from the design and administration of the Hardest Hit Fund programs.
 
We hope you can attend this informational meeting.
 
With Appreciation,
