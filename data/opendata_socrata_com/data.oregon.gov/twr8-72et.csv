Tucker,Ruberti,tucker.ruberti@aei.com,AEI,OR,"Hi DEQ Team,
I have been involved in the energy industry for over 20 years.  In my career I have never seen a solution that is more misguided than ethanol mandates.  It is basically a policy of using oil, water and pesticides to create a similar fuel output in terms of energy content.  I am strongly against any policy that does not deliver at least a 2-3 x EROEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested) and ethanol struggles ot get a 1:1 EROEI.  Please stop subsidizing a inefficient fuel.  

Sincerely,
Tucker Ruberti",

Especially after the results of November 4th, when climate deniers were returned to DC from across the nation, it is very clear that we cannot expect very much leadership on the global warming / climate chaos front from Washington.  Since greenhouse gas emissions from transportation consistently appear in the top three causes of such emissions, it is necessary that we do whatever we can to reduce those emissions.  One way to do this s to reduce the carbon concentration in fuels.  Efforts to implement the clean fuel standards of 2009 House Bill 2186 are applauded by all those across the state who care about the livability f the planet for future generations.",

KEITH,REGELIN,a8fb4853@opayq.com,,OR,"I urge you to NOT adopt the  costly new Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  It  will unfairly penalize lower-income Oregonians who pay a larger share of their income on transportation, and will punish small businesses that are sensitive to high fuel costs. ",
Jim,Edelson,edelson8@gmail.com,,oregon,"A critical responsibility of state government is to set product standards for market products within its jurisdictional authority.  Motor vehicle fuels are no different. It is the reponsibility, indeed the duty, of Oregon to set appropriate standards for fuels puchased and consumed by its residents.  

The Clean Fuels Program (CFP) does exactly this â€“ and does so in a way that meets the framework set forth  by the Legislature to implement such rules.  My comments will address one factor in the framework â€“ imapact on consumers and the economy of Oregon.  As a matter of disclosure, I was honored to serve as alternate member of the Phase 1 Advisory Committee for the Carbon Fuel Standard.

Much analysis has been provided by opponents of the CFP.  As is well known, the appropriateness of their  methodology â€“ and the subsequent economic and price impact analysis - has been questioned.  One interesting facet of this is that the results produced from their analysis provide wide ranges of impact on the price per gallon of gas â€“ but the sponsors of the research nearly always choose to publicize and testify solely on  price impacts that exceed $1.00 per gallon.  

Of course, the independent analyses conducted by the state and its consultants show much more limited impacts on gas prices â€“ up to a maximum of 19 cents over 10 years.  This lower price impact band  is corroborated by similar research conducted for the California Air Resources Board.  As a result, independent econometric models done for the CFP rulemaking  accurately reflect net positive benefits for  Oregonâ€™s economy.  It should be intuitive that when market incentives for in-state industry and a cleaner environment are combined with an improved balance of trade, better economic conditions result.
DEQ and EQC should deliberately move forward with the proposed rules to set an important product standard with the CFP. 

Proper product standards for motor vehicle fuels will benefit Oregonâ€™s economy and environment â€“ and they should not be derailed by unsubstantiated claims of its opponents. The Legislaure will have the opportunity to address the fate of CFP in 2015 â€“ do not deprive them of   full decision-making scope in this matter.

Steven,Harrington,sharrington@oda.state.or.us,Oregon Department of Agriculture,Oregon,"Cory,

My intention in these comments is to address the definitions in the proposed rule changes to OAR 340-253.  There are minor changes proposed to -0200 and -0400 which accompany the suggested definition changes.

-----------------------
Definitions
-----------------------
The terms â€œClear Gasolineâ€&#65533; and â€œClear Dieselâ€&#65533; appear in 340-253-0400 and in the referenced carbon intensity table.  Consider adding definitions for these terms.

* â€œClear Gasolineâ€&#65533; means gasoline that has not been blended with a renewable fuel.

* â€œClear Dieselâ€&#65533; means diesel that has not been blended with a renewable fuel.

I suggest definitions for gasoline and diesel fuel that reference the relevant ASTM standards and allow the gasoline and diesel substitute definitions cover everything else.  That will keep the definitions for these terms in this rule in line with the rest of the state;

* â€œGasolineâ€&#65533; means a spark ignition engine fuel conforming to the specifications defined in ASTM D 4814.

Please Note: D4814 does not restrict the quantity of ethanol or any other renewable fuel blended in the motor fuel.  ASTM is intentionally vague on the exact composition of gasoline.

* â€œDiesel Fuelâ€&#65533; means a compression ignition engine fuel conforming to the specifications of either ASTM D 975 or ASTM D7467.

Please note that this defines diesel fuel containing up to and including 20% biodiesel by volume.  D975 covers blends of biodiesel from 0-5% and D7467 covers blends from 6% to 20% by volume.  Both documents describe specifications for ""Diesel Fuel Oil"".

------
Fast forward to 340-253-0200 with these proposed definitions; 
------
Regulated and Clean Fuels
(1) Applicability, (stuff deleted - no change recommended)
(a) Gasoline;
(b)Diesel Fuel;
(c)(delete this item, the new gasoline definition includes ethanol blending)
(d)(delete this item, the new diesel fuel definition includes biodiesel or biomass based diesel blending)
(e) Denatured Fuel Ethanol (drop the  E100)
(f) Biodiesel (drop the â€œneatâ€&#65533; and B100)
(g) Biomass-Based Diesel (again drop the â€œneatâ€&#65533; and B100)
(h) Any other liquid or non-liquid fuel not listed in section (3) or exempted under OAR 340-253-0250.
------

â€œneatâ€&#65533; in the above list doesnâ€™t have a formal definition and so is potentially meaningless. The term Denatured Fuel Ethanol has the exact same meaning as Ethanol per the definitions and refers to the ASTM D 4806 specification which includes standards for purity.  The same comment applies to Biodiesel and Biomass Based Diesel as they refer to ASTM D 6751 which contains standards for purity.  Blending or dilution really isnâ€™t an issue within this list.

------
Fast forward to 340-253-0400 with these proposed definitions
------
Fuel Carbon Intensity Values

(1) Statewide carbon intensity values
(a) Regulated parties, credit generators and brokers must use the statewide average carbon intensity values in Table 3 or 4 under OAR 340-253-8030 or -8040as applicable, for the following fuels;

(A) Gasoline (the new definition covers both blended and unblended fuels)
(B) (delete this item)
(C) Diesel Fuel (the new definition covers fuels blended with up to 20% D6751 compliant blending stock)
(D) (delete this item)

(the remaining list is unchanged except for numbering)
------

Back to the definitions;

I suggest altering the definition of â€œrenewable dieselâ€&#65533; to reference ASTM D 975 implicitly through the definition for the term â€œdiesel fuelâ€&#65533; and will guarantee that its meaning is consistent with that of diesel fuel.

* â€œRenewable Dieselâ€&#65533; means diesel fuel derived from vegetable oils, animal fats, or other non petroleum resources.

The definitions involving natural gas seem awkward to me, especially when we start talking about â€œliquefied-compressed natural gasâ€&#65533; since this term describes a process rather than a product.  It can be cleared up as follows;

Define the terms â€œBio-Basedâ€&#65533; and â€œFossilâ€&#65533;

* â€œBio-Basedâ€&#65533; means produced from non-petroleum, biological renewable resources.

* â€œFossilâ€&#65533; means derived solely from petroleum or fossil sources such as oil fields and coal beds.

Drop the definitions for:
- Bio-Based Liquified Natural Gas
- Bio-Based Compressed Natural Gas
- Bio-Based Liquified-Compressed Natural Gas
- Fossil Liquefied Natural Gas
- Fossil Compressed Natural Gas
- Fossil Liquified-Compressed Natural Gas

By doing this weâ€™ve traded 6 definitions for 2 without changing the meaning of the terms in the remainder of the text.  

This really clears up the meaning of the terms Bio-Based Liquified-Compressed Natural Gas and Fossil Liquified-Compressed Natural Gas.  Natural gas can be compressed, it can be liquefied, but it is not both.  The definition for â€œLiquified-Compressed Natural Gasâ€&#65533; is clear even if the term is awkward.  Its liquefied natural gas transported into the state that is re-gasified and compressed for use as a motor fuel.  The original definitions for these terms do not convey this meaning.

I suggest changing the definition of Biogas to the following;

* â€œBiogasâ€&#65533; means gas, consisting primarily of methane and carbon dioxide, produced by the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter.

Landfills and digesters are examples of locations where anaerobic decomposition may occur but are not really part of the actual definition.  The explanation that this is not a suitable fuel for automobiles is good information but is again not really part of the definition.

Atul,Deshmane,atul@whole-energy.com,Whole Energy Fuels Corp,Washington,"Whole Energy has operated in the biodiesel industry in Washington, Oregon, and California since 2006. We have seen firsthand the effects of clean renewable fuel policy at the state and federal level. We have been in the industry since its inception, and are currently the largest privet distributor of biodiesel on the West Coast.
 
Clean fuel standards do more than just lower the pollution intensity of a stateâ€™s transportation system. They provide support for the development of new technologies that improve in efficiency with each new generation. They promote the conversion of waste products from industry into fuels and energy. They fundamentally shift the focus of the fuels industry from global markets to domestic independence, keeping dollars spent on fuel production in state.
 
We wish to add our voice in support of the Oregon Clean Fuels Standard. This policy has the potential to be the best of its kind in the US. We encourage Oregon to look to the projects in California and British Columbia to learn from their mistakes and to view a case study on how this policy will truly affect retail prices for the consuming public.
 
Oregonâ€™s long standing support of clean fuel and progressive approach to air quality mitigation create an ideal working condition to nurture a developing project and lay a foundation for the future of energy in our country.",

Gordon,Challstrom,gordon@cwconcrete.com,Resident,Oregon,"While everyone wants clean air, we must not destroy our economy in pursuit of minimal gains. As a resident of Oregon in the 60's and 70's before the Clean Air Act, there is no doubt we have achieved great strides in cleaning up our air. We need to do a cost analysis to be sure we don't destroy whats left of our economy. With the legislature proposing a mileage tax on drivers instead of the fuel tax, we could price ourselves out of the market. Already, Oregon's taxes are too high and regulations too numerous that these policies deter business from moving to Oregon. Further regulations will lead to lower pollution emissions by way of reduced industry and jobs in Oregon. The net result is an even lower medium income for all Oregonians coupled with ever higher energy prices which further squeeze Oregon family budgets. Remember to put Oregon families into the equation when proposing new burdensome rules that provide minimum results at a high cost to our economy and jobs. What good is clean air if you can't feed or house your family? Take a holistic approach that values self sufficiency and freedom instead of dependence and limited opportunity.",
