"Health Authority, Oregon","Proposal of permanently adopting and amending adrministrative rules in chapter 333, division 8 to govern the Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program - Rulemaking Hearing",333-008 Rulemaking Hearing,05/22/2014 12:00:00 PM,,"1300 NW Wall St, Barnes-Sawyer Room", Bend,OR,"The Oregon Health Authority, Public Health Division is proposing to permanently adopt and amend rules in chapter 333, division 8 to govern the newly created Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program, as required by HB 3460 (Oregon Laws 2013, chapter 726). In 2013, the Legislature passed HB 3460, directing the Authority to establish by rule a medical marijuana facility registration system to authorize the transfer of usable marijuana and immature marijuana plants. These rules also established fees for applying and registering and renewing registration for a medical marijuana facility. These changes were implemented beginning January 15, 2014 with a temporary rulemaking that expires on July 13, 2014. This proposed rulemaking will make those changes in rule permanent.

This program has been created to regulate and inspect facilities that transfer marijuana to Oregon Medical Marijuana Program cardholders, and ensure that they meet certain standards related to public and patient safety.

You are being invited to review and comment on the proposed rules.

In 2013, the Legislature passed HB 3460, directing the Authority to establish by rule a medical marijuana facility registration system to authorize the transfer of usable marijuana and immature marijuana plants. These rules also established fees for applying and registering and renewing registration for a medical marijuana facility. These changes were implemented beginning January 15, 2014 with a temporary rulemaking that expires on July 13, 2014. This proposed rulemaking will make those changes in rule permanent.

This program has been created to regulate and inspect facilities that transfer marijuana to Oregon Medical Marijuana Program cardholders, and ensure that they meet certain standards related to public and patient safety.

You are being invited to review and comment on the proposed rules.

The hospital invites citizens of Junction City and the surrounding area to come learn about the hospital and the people it serves.

The Radioactive Materials Licensing (RML) program is proposing to amend rules to comply with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) 10 CFR Part 35 and 71, within divisions 116 and 118. The amendments are in reference to providing advanced notification to Native American Tribes of the transportation of certain types of nuclear material. These amendments will also correct rule references relating to 10 CFR Part 35, in regards to Authorized User training requirements to administer byproduct materials to patients for medical diagnosis and treatment. 

Chapter 333, division 103 is being amended to increase annual radioactive materials licensing fees by 25 percent.  During the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, furloughs and cost adjustment freezes were implemented. RPS’s RML program ended the 2011-2013 biennium with an ending balance of $165,357 which carried over into the 2013-2015 biennium. This resulted in a 56 percent decrease compared to the 2009-2011 carryover balance. 

The projected 2013-2015 biennium expenditure budget has a projected 13.5 percent increase for personal services.  The projected 2013-2015 ending balance will be a negative $3,841. It is estimated that the RML program will need to generate an additional $344,336 in addition to the previous biennium revenue of $1,667,032 to meet future expenditures. The last radioactive materials licensing fee increase was in 2010. 

The RML program revenue is 100 percent dependent on user fees collected annually from radioactive material licensees. There are no general or federal funds provided to support operations. The fees are in direct relation with services involved in regulating the radioactive material industry. License fees are assessed to recover the cost of operations and administrative functions relating to the regulation of the medical, academia, industrial, and research industries that use radioactive materials as part of their operations. 

The X-ray program is adopting, repealing and amending rules in division 106 to align current computed tomography (CT) rules with emerging technology and address the use of the veterinary X-ray technique chart.

<p> </p>
<p>SB 172 (Oregon Laws 2013, chapter 334), passed during the 2013 legislative session, directs the Authority to adopt administrative rules no later than January 1, 2014 that require birthing facilities to perform pulse oximetry screening on each newborn delivered at the birthing facility before discharging the newborn.  Birthing facilities include both hospitals that provide services related to the delivery of newborns and birthing centers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In response the Authority adopted temporary rules in chapter 333, divisions 76 and 520 related to pulse oximetry screening for newborns at hospitals and birthing centers, effective January 1, 2014 through June 29, 2014 that require birthing facilities to perform, prior to discharge, pulse oximetry screening on every newborn delivered at the birthing facility effective March 1, 2014. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Oregon Health Authority (Authority), Public Health Division is now proposing to adopt permanent administrative rules prior to the expiration of the temporary administrative rules now in place.  The proposed permanent rules will establish requirements for pulse oximetry screening in hospitals and Birthing Centers.  The proposed rules differ from the temporary rules currently in place</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are being invited to review the proposed rules and to comment on them.  If you wish to present oral testimony, a public hearing will be held in Portland, Oregon at 800 NE Oregon St, Room 1E, on May 20, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. You may also file written comments before 5:00 p.m. on May 23, 2014 to the Public Health Division Rules Coordinator at the following address:</p>

In 2013, the Legislature passed HB 3460, directing the Authority to establish by rule a medical marijuana facility registration system to authorize the transfer of usable marijuana and immature marijuana plants. These rules also established fees for applying and registering and renewing registration for a medical marijuana facility. These changes were implemented beginning January 15, 2014 with a temporary rulemaking that expires on July 13, 2014. This proposed rulemaking will make those changes in rule permanent.

This program has been created to regulate and inspect facilities that transfer marijuana to Oregon Medical Marijuana Program cardholders, and ensure that they meet certain standards related to public and patient safety.

"Health Authority, Oregon",Administrative Rulemaking Hearing,"Rulemaking hearing for OAR 333-008, Medical Marijuana Dispensaries",08/18/2014 09:00:00 AM,,500 Summer St. NE Room 137 A-D, Salem,OR,"RULE SUMMARY
The Oregon Health Authority is proposing to adopt permanent rules for the Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program to comply with SB 1531 (Oregon Laws 2014, chapter 79). The bill had an emergency clause and was effective March 19, 2014.   The bill authorizes local governments to impose time and manner of operation regulations on medical marijuana facilities.  While local governments create these regulations, they may impose a moratorium on facilities within their jurisdiction until May 1, 2015.  In addition the bill requires all marijuana dispensed to be in child-resistant containers (as defined by rule) and no product may be dispensed if it is manufactured to appeal to children (as defined by rule). 

These rules implement requirements in SB 1531 related to packaging and manufacturing of usable marijuana, and local government moratoria of dispensaries. These rules define the process by which local governmental jurisdictions may impose a moratorium on facilities located within their jurisdiction; define the type of packaging (child-resistant) that a facility must use when dispensing medical marijuana; and define the type of product that a facility may dispense. The products may not be manufactured or dispensed in a manner that is attractive to minors.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan.,06/18/2018 06:30:00 PM,06/18/2018 08:30:00 PM,Hood River Inn 1108 E Marina Drive, Hood River,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan.,06/19/2018 12:00:00 PM,06/19/2018 02:00:00 PM,Eastern Oregon Trade and Event Center 1750 E Airport Road, Hermiston,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

The Oral Health Program at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division is holding a series of rules advisory committee (RAC) meetings to discuss amendments to rules related to dental pilot projects.

Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/27/2018 11:00:00 AM,06/27/2018 01:00:00 PM,Astoria Armory 1636 Exchange Street, Astoria,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.

"Health Authority, Oregon",CCO 2.0 Community Meeting,,06/19/2018 06:30:00 PM,06/19/2018 08:30:00 PM,"Treasure Valley Community College, Weese Building, Room 110 650 College Blvd", Ontario,OR,"Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen is hitting the road this summer to engage Oregonians in a conversation about the future of the Oregon Health Plan. Allen is scheduled to travel to 10 communities (Astoria, Bend, Coos Bay, Corvallis, Hermiston, Hood River, Klamath Falls, Ontario, Portland and Springfield) to discuss how far Oregon’s health transformation has come and where it's going, and to get feedback on proposed policy options to improve the state’s coordinated care system.

The end of the first five-year contracts with coordinated care organizations (CCOs) marks an opportunity for the Oregon Health Policy Board to work with stakeholders to improve the services that 1 million Oregonians receive through the Oregon Health Plan. CCOs are community-governed organizations that bring together physical, mental health, addiction medicine, and dental health providers to coordinate care for people on the Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid).

Since 2012 Oregon’s coordinated care model has saved taxpayers an estimated $2.2 billion, while also reducing unnecessary emergency department visits, and improving preventive care for children and adults.

On June 5 OHA presented policy options and strategies to the Oregon Health Policy Board to shape the next five years of health care coverage offered through the Oregon Health Plan. The policy options were informed by public input gathered this spring through surveys, community forums, in-person and online stakeholder meetings, and emails.

The policies focus on four priority improvement areas identified by Governor Kate Brown:

•	Maintain sustainable cost growth.
•	Increase value-based payments that pay for performance.
•	Focus on social determinants of health and equity.
•	Improve the behavioral health system.

OHA will continue to gather public input on the policy options throughout the summer, and the Oregon Health Policy Board will adopt final recommendations this fall. Coordinated care contracts for 2020-2025 are expected to be awarded in summer 2019.
