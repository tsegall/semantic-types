Patrick,Gibson,tesla@pegibson.com,,Oregon,"$50,000 max price should be set on base MSRP (excluding options). This artificial limit prevents people from transitioning to the best EV cars available. Over time, electric cars will come down in price, but the initial batches will be more expensive. The spirit of this law is to encourage people to invest in renewable resources. By adding limits in this way, it discourages people from getting the best product available, thus delaying the time that they transition to sustainable resources.",

Debbie,Jimmerson,dajtypes@outlook.com,,Oregon,"The rebate should apply to the base model price of the electric car.  Chevy Bolt, Tesla Model 3, and others would qualify for base price but can go over $50K if such options as longer range and quick charge ability are added to the car.  It would be difficult to justify some models of the same type of car being eligible and others not being eligible.  Determining from the base price would eliminate that confusion for car models that should be eligible for the program.  I can appreciate that the luxury models with higher base price than $50K may be excluded.",
Joshua,Shulman,joshuashulman@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Please make the rebates effective Jan 1. Anything else is not fair to those who depended on the law, which, after all, was passed many months ago now.  Please offer the maximum rebate amount.  The whole âscrap your old carâ and âlive in a poor air quality neighborhoodâ requirements should be scrapped. How does a person figure out if they live in âan area of the state with elevated concentrations of air contaminants commonly attributable to motor vehicle emissions?â And whyâs it matter? If I live on a bucolic, clean-aired farm, but commute into smogsville every day, the people of smogsville still benefit from my zero-emissions vehicle, regardless of where I reside.  And why does someone with a 20-year old car to scrap get $2500, but someone with a 19-year old car doesnât? Encouraging low- and moderate-income people to get EVs should not depend on where they live or how old their current car is.  âArea median incomeâ is confusing in several ways:   What yearâs median household income are we looking at? The year prior to purchase? The year of the last census?  What yearâs buyer income are we looking at? If one buys the car in 2018, does one determine whether one qualifies as âlow or moderate incomeâ based on income on 2017 tax forms? What if 2017 income is âmoderate,â but 2018 income is above that level?  Oregon must rely on a particular analysis to determine median household income. The regs should indicate where to find that analysis.  Is the median Household income based on number of occupants in the household? Are there different âmedian household incomesâ based on household size?   New topic - typo:  340-270-0120 (2)(f) - the word âAgreesâ should be âAgreeâ  340-270-0430 (1)(c) - do you want to say that the high-emission vehicle to be scrapped must have been registered to the person applying for the rebate for 2 years? Or just registered? Is there anything to stop one from buying an old car purely to scrap it for the rebate? Or is that consistent with the intent of the regs, as it still gets the vehicle off the road?",https://data.oregon.gov/views/b3xb-ujzi/files/308a2241-d5f0-4313-9855-003c88213fe6?filename=Shulman+Comment.pdf
Marl,Miller,gwion@comcast.net,,Oregon,"I firlmy believe that the public at every level administration must support the switch to renewable energy, and strongly support the Oregon rebate program. On a personal note, quite a few of us were assured that we needed to lease (in our case) a car before the first of 2018 in order to be eligible for the rebate, and we budgeted for that. So I would ask that people who switched to renewable anytime after the progam began in October 2017 be eligible. Thank you",

Joshua,Webster,joshowebster@gmail.com,,Oregon,"For the Zero-Emission and Electric Vehicle rebate program I have several concerns. First, it appears that the program provisions listed just above Section 148 of HB2017 say that the provisions of the program are operative January 1, 2018, while Section 156 of HB2017 says that rebates may be issued for vehicles that were leased on or after the effective date of HB2017 (October 6, 2017). Rebates should be issued for those vehicles purchased or leased on or after October 6, 2017. Second, Section 148 (e) of HB2017 says the base manufacturer's suggested retail price needs to be less than $50,000. The price determined to be base should be that of the lowest cost configuration of a particular model name, not including any extra features such as extended range, premium interior, additional cost color options, or software upgradable features, etc. Third, the rebate amount should be variable based on type of vehicle. Since the first year (2018) it is only available to limited types of vehicles that are most likey to be long range, multi passenger, and have the biggest impact on the environment, the full amount should be available. For future years when low speed vehicles and motorcycles that will generally be of higher overall efficency will be included, a tiered rebate amount for them to allow for more total rebates could be beneficial.",

The base model for the Tesla Model 3 is $35,000, but current packages can exceed $50k.  This model is being mass-produced and a significant amount of Oregonians, needing this credit, will be purchasing this model. This model may be above our normal range of affordability now, but this vehicle is important in terms of showing how zero-emission EVs are superior to internal combustion engine cars in terms of safety, efficiency, technology, performance, maintenance, and aesthetics. These rebates are critical for the initial transition to a new technology. ",

Andrew,Harbison,harbisona@hotmail.com,Citizen,OR,"I purchased a Chevrolet Bolt EV in January 2017 primarily to take advantage of the federal tax rebate (of up to $7,500). While I am also interested in a non-emissions means of transportation, this federal tax rebate made the proposition more immediately-palatable and motivated me to act, quickly, as it is to eventually be phased-out.     As the air quality in the greater Portland, Oregon area continues to be challenged by fossil fuel-based transportation (particularly, diesel emissions), there is importance in the state encouraging its citizens to contribute to the effort to improve their environment and, thereby, the health of their fellow citizens -particularly given the fact that many of these citizens are relatively-forced to reside in housing that is routinely and exceptional close to the source of such emissions (i.e. Low-income housing located near major thoroughfares such as interstate highways).     Additionally, affordability is broadening across the socioeconomic-spectrum for currently-available, high-quality electric vehicles with exceptional range; as the “electric highway” continues to take shape, more of the region will continue to become accessible to them.     Through an incentive-program that can truly be accessed by all of its citizens, Oregon’s DEQ is demonstrating the fundamental-commitment of leadership necessary to transform the common form of energy used for transportation into one that is more-consistent with the public good.

My primary comment is that the $2,500 incentive for low income residents sets way too high a bar to be useful.  The number of people that own a car over 20 years old and live in an area with serious air pollution and meet the income requirements is probably so small to be meaningless.  Let's keep it simple.  Just use the income as the determinant of whether someone qualifies for getting the $2,500 rebate.  The purpose of this is to expedite the uptake of zero-emission vehicles.  So let's do it and not make it so hard especially for people who might not be able to buy one otherwise.  Thank you for pushing ahead with this incentive.  I happen to own an electric car which we purchased in 2017 - a Chevy Bolt. I would love to see thousands of similar cars travelling around Oregon.

James,Neu,Jjneusies2@gmail.com,350.Eug,Oregon,I believe the vehicle incentive should be retroactive back to 10/17 and continue for as long as possible. Now is the time to get off fossil fuels and switch to EV's and 100% renewable energy sources. Oregon is fortunate to have mostly renewable sources of energy and we need to commit to clean energy. I took advantage of the last incentive program two years ago and got photovoltaic on my roof and an electric vehicle drastically reducing my carbon footprint.

Shouldn't Oregon use a phaseout approach for certain vehicles similar to the Federal rules? Why is Oregon selecting a 10 kWh battery size vs the Federal 5 kWh battery size?   Is the rule also adds a minimum of 10 miles electric range (which is good,) for eligible vehicles, but should discuss why it is different from the Federal rules I think using the more restrictive rules may match other states which is good, but should be noted as to why different than the Federal.

I agree with others who have commented that the vehicle base MSRP (without options) should be limited to $50,000 not the purchase price because the way the rule is currently written it could slow the adoption of the first round of compelling mass market electric vehicles by limiting options to vehicles with shorter range and slower charging capabilities. In order to promote the quickest transition of the vehicle fleet to zero emissions vehicles and economies of scale that can reduce the price of ZEVs and negate the need for ZEV incentives early adopter consumers will need to purchase cars that hover in the $50,000s. This is more than most consumers are traditionally accustomed to paying up front and the $2,500 rebate can still be very helpful to this group of consumers",

Traig,Van Dyke,ergoaudrey@hotmail.com,,OR,"Since the goal of this program is to encourage people to transition to zero emission vehicles, ANY fully electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle should be candidates for a rebate, regardless of base price.  A maximum base price would only prevent some of the longer range battery electric vehicles from qualifying, such as the Tesla Model X, Model S, and Jaguar I-Pace.   Plug-in hybrids, however should not qualify for a rebate since most have very small battery packs (less than 10kWh), which often provide electric-only ranges well below the average commute.  And even in electric-only mode with most plug-in hybrids, pressing the gas pedal down far enough will engage the internal combustion engine to assist.  These cars continue to harm our health, the environment, and maintain our reliance on oil.",
James,Hannan,jhannan29@yahoo.com,None,Oregon,"The retroactive rebate element of the plan is broken.  All Oregonians benefit from each electric motor powered vehicle mile that replaces an internal combustion engine powered vehicle mile.  Electric powered vehicles that were purchased longest ago have benefited us all the most, and those most recently purchased have benefited us all the least.  The retroactive rebate as envisioned now acts in exactly the opposite way, it rewards those who purchased electric vehicles recently and ignores those who foresaw the issue long ago and took action.  This needs to be fixed.  It may be easier to use an arbitrary rebate eligibility span beginning in January of '18 or even October of '17, but this is the wrong thing to do.  Just because it is easy does not bake it right.  Rebates need to be offered to those who purchased electric vehicles first.  Electric power only vehicles should see a greater rebate than plug-in hybrid vehicles.  The relative amounts would be arbitrary, probably based on average electric power to gasoline power ratio from typical hybrid vehicle usage, but the rebate system should incentivise 100% electric vehicle purchases to a greater amount than plug-in hybrid vehicle purchases.",

Robert,Ralston,bob@ubcobikesus.com,"Ubco Bikes US, LLC",OR,"I compliment DEQ for introducing a rebate program focused on incentivizing consumers to purchase or lease zero-emission vehicles.  The comparative cost of power train systems between fossil fueled and electric powered vehicles is narrowing as EV technology and product manufacturing continues to evolve.  That said, if the vehicle choice of today’s consumer is based on purchase price then rebate programs such as this will go a long way in helping bridge the consumer’s adoption and demand for zero-emission vehicles.   As the US distributor of a 30 mph pure electric motorcycle, I would like to make a strong suggestion that DEQ reconsider their proposed rule that an electric motorcycle must be capable of attaining a speed of 55 mph or greater to qualify for this rebate program.   A speed of 55 mph or greater would suggest that the primary focus of this rebate program is intended for vehicles capable of highway transportation.  The current DEQ proposal is a good plan, but it could be better in helping to drive the use of affordable zero-emissions vehicles used for daily transportation across all economic categories particularly with low to middle income households who could really benefit in replacing 20 year old internal combustion vehicles with clean, affordable zero-emissions urban transportation vehicles.  What if you reconsidered the vast use of vehicles used for inner city, urban transportation and commuting needs that will never see a mile of 55 mph + highway use.  The concentration of internal combustion cars and vehicles in our cities contribute to poor air quality and overall congestion.  I’m suggesting the inclusion of two-wheel zero-emission motor vehicles or electric motorcycles that fall into a motor vehicle class or category that ranges in maximum performance speeds of 30 to 50 mph. This performance speed class of electric vehicles is growing and will continue to evolve in our cities and urban environment as an affordable choice for daily transportation.  My recommendation to DEQ is that you consider modifying your proposed rebate program to include 30 to 50 mph, two wheel, zero-emissions motor vehicles as well.  Thank you.  ",

Leslie,Lowe,inharmony46@charter.net,,OR,I just bought a hybrid plug in (2017 Ford C-Max energi).  Ford has quit making these cars because so few were purchased.  A solid rebate program would encourage more people to buy electric vehicles.  I put on solar panels to use instead of coal burning plants to produce my electricity.  We need to m aintain rebates for solar panels and do  more advertising to encourage folks to do both solar panels and plug in cars.,

Terrance,Hawley,565 Shelokum Dr,Silverton,OR,"Consider matching the Federal incentive for $7,500 that is expected to expire this summer ill expire for America's largest EV manufacture. Oregon's timing of ZEV tax credits is excellently positioned to help ensure the continued acceptance of EVs and a better future for our grandchildren. ",
Charles,Smith,Smith2650@comcast.net ,,Oregon ,"I fully and enthusiatically support the rebate program.  I think the effective date should be moved back to the effective date of the legislation, which I believe was sometime in October of 2017.  I leased a  electric vehicle in November with an understanding that the bill had passed and that the rebate would or should apply to such leases given the legislature's apparent intent.  I  believe that the charge ahead program has great potential and that helping lower and moderate income people purchase EVs, especially used EVS will be most beneficial.  I hope that the agency will developed some simple forms to help people meet the requirement of showing how they meet the income, residential location, and scrap requirements.  I wish the legislature had either not included the scrap requirement or made it so that it was a bonus rebate so that an otherwise qualified person would receive at least half of the intended rebate even if they did not scrap a car of at least 20 years old.",
Travis,Gintz,tgintz@gmail.com,,OR,I support this. We need to get away from Fossil Fuels. The NW uses renewable energy and can benefit greatly.,
Judith,Huck,judith.huck@comcast.net,,Oregon,"We support zero-emission vehicle rebates which encourage vehicle buyers to consider, and hopefully purchase, zero-emission vehicles.  This in turn helps all of Oregons citizens by reducing the amount of pollution in our air.  We also encourage DEQ not to have a maximum on the EV car purchase price to qualify for rebate.  Why discourage a buyer from buying a car with longer range?  More expensive cars usually have longer range.  Putting a maximum purchase price may discourage those living in rural areas from considering EV's.  Thank you",
Quinn,Sullivan,qsullivan11@gmail.com,,OR,"This would be a great program. In the use of fossil fuels, there are unpaid externalities in the form of air pollution locally, and greenhouse gases globally. This program would help encourage the use of electric vehicles, and encourage the implementation of more renewable energy sources.",

Scott,Phelan,mtnchieftain@yahoo.com,,Oregon,"The best way to promote the use of electric vehicles is through a vehicle rebate program.  These cars are very expensive and the best EVs will easily cost more than the proposed $50K MSRP cap.  People should be allowed to purchase the most efficient EV in terms of range and required options.  Oregon is a vast state and many require the added range that is required to travel the state.  The initial group of EVs currently for sale easily exceed the $50K limit. Limiting the $50K to base price would be a better option.  This will incentivize the greatest number of people who aren't interested in the least capable EV currently offered, but will adopt the EV that meets their needs that currently cannot be purchased for an MSRP of under $50K.",
Reed,Arce,RCArce01@yahoo.com,,OR,As an Oregon taxpayer I fully support this rebate and believe it should be implemented to help spur a faster transition to cleaner energy consumption. I will continue to support Oregon towards becoming a leader in renewable energy (both generation and consumption) in order to keep our state clean and green.,

Regna,Merritt,regna@oregonpsr.org,Oregon PSR,OR,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rulemaking for Zero Emission and Electric Vehicle Rebate Program  These rules are too limited in scope because they designed to subsidize only large electric vehicles. We request that they be modified and that definitions of qualifying vehicles include small electric vehicles (SEVs).   There are many dozens of makes and models of SEVs on the market, including scooters. bicycles, tricycles, and velomobiles. Their sales are limited due to costs related, in part,  to the electric motor.  Providing a sizable rebate for SEVs would likely change that. This could benefit low-income residents, for whom purchase of large electric vehicles, even used vehicles, is prohibitively expensive.  There are obvious public health benefits to use of SEVs but encouraging use of these vehicles would produce additional economic benefit for SEV manufacturers in Oregon.  Examples of proposed definitions that exclude most SEVs:  1. The definition of ""light-duty zero emission vehicle"" includes only vehicles capable of traveling at 55 MPH.   2 The definition requires that the vehicle have four wheels.  3.The requirement that the vehicle be able to travel 75 miles on a charge.   4.The definition of ""neighborhood electric vehicle"" as one can at travel at 25 mph. This excludes electric-assist bicycles and tricycles and velomobiles, as Oregon law requires that they have a top speed of 24 mph.  5.The definition of ""zero-emission motorcycle""  requires that the vehicle go 55 mph, a speed not desirable or even legal for most urban trips.   Additionally, the rules should be improved to support hybrid human-electric powered tricycles, which reduce diesel pollution from trucks and  increase energy efficiency in transporting freight. One need only look to Europe for examples of cities have banned combustion-engine trucks from their central areas. Electric vehicles, including fleets of hybrid human-electric powered tricycles, are used there to deliver goods.  SEV's reduce air and noise pollution, reduce traffic congestion and improve public health. Please include SEV's in the rebate program.  Thank you for your consideration,  Regna Merritt",
