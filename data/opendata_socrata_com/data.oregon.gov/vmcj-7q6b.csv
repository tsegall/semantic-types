Bob,Strong,bob@envirotest.biz,EnviroTest LLC,Oregon,"""Small-scale, short duration renovating and maintenance activity"" (Definition 42) should allow for removal of a small section of plaster just as it now allows for removal of a small section of drywall and it should provide for Installation of plumbing conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials just as it now does for electrical conduits. These two additions would provide for the vast majority of plumbing and electrical service visits where a new electrical switch or outlet is required, running new electrical service through the use of small openings in walls and ceilings, and re-piping a house or repairing a plumbing leak within a wall.",
Traci ,Strong ,Creekwoodestateshoa@gmail.com ,Creekwood Estates HOA,Oregon ,I think these new rules should definitely be imposed. Currently my homeowners association is dealing with an illegal dump on our common property which contains both Asbestos and Lead. I would feel much more confident knowing that the abatement and removal is safer for my two young kids especially considering we only live one house away from the dump site. ,
Edwin,Edinger,eeedinger@earthlink.net,Asbestos Training Project,Oregon,Attached is a review of the proposed new asbestos rules,https://data.oregon.gov/views/vmcj-7q6b/files/e4a32912-30e0-4ef2-af1b-462e884f6bdd?filename=Oregon+DEQ+Rules+2018+Review.pdf
Joette,Storm,gjstorm@gmail.com,private citizen,OR,When I was in elementary school asbestos was thought to be a miracle product improving our lives. Then we all learned how the substance could cause harm to health. We must protect ourselves and others by strengthening the rules for how asbestos is used and how workers are protected from the cancer causing agents. ,
Joe,White,joe@ettnw.com,Environmental Testing & Training NorthWest,OR,"Public Comment to Proposed Rule OAR 340-248-0270 

1.	Re “Statement of fiscal and economic impact”, item 3. Accredited laboratories for asbestos testing; The accreditation column lists two accreditation programs, NIST/NVLAP and AIHA or Proficiency Analysis Testing under BAPAT.
Comment: A requirement for accreditation by NVLAP/NIST or IHLAP/AIHA would be a sever financial burden for laboratories such as ETTNW. ETTNW does not perform analysis for schools K-12, and primarily focuses on clients in the water restoration and remodeling market. Therefore, the alternative to participate in BAPAT/AIHA PAT programs would not be nearly the financial burden as a requirement for NVLAP and AIHA accreditation requirements. 

2.	Question: Would there be any value in an Oregon PLM Lab participating in the NELAC/ORELAP PLM Accreditation program as an alternative to NCLAP/AIHA, based on the information in the following comment?

Comment: We refer to the NELAC 2003 Standard, Appendix D.6, Asbestos Testing which specifically refers to follow the NIST SRMs for accreditation of Asbestos Labs for PLM under NELAC.

3.	Re proposed 340-248-270(d)(E) An Asbestos Survey Report that contains… “Description of the facility or area surveyed, including its past and current use, area square footage, approximate construction date, and number of floors.
Comment: The “past use” may not be readily apparent or available to the building inspector, nor will the construction date be easily ascertained. This is asking the inspector to do additional research that does not have a direct bearing on the results of the survey.

4.	Re proposed 340-248-270(d)(I) An Asbestos Survey Report that contains… “A recommendation of a response action that complies with the requirements of division 248; 
Comment: This requires the inspector to exceed the normal Scope of Work for the sampling required prior to a renovation/restoration activity for which the sampling is required. The abatement and/or disaster renovation company’s scope of work would provide this information to the building owner, depending on the positive or negative results of the analysis of the building materials sampled for asbestos.

Larry,Tilford,ltilford@exede.net,Marion County,Oregon,I am strongly opposed to the section of this legislation making it a requirement on homeowners to test for asbestos.  The entire science around asbestos is deeply flawed and the only people who have had problems with it are the dockworkers from the seventies who had major long-term exposure.  This proposal places huge financial burdens on the residents of Oregon State and is unconscionable.,
,,,,,"340-248-0270
(3) For demolitions and renovations of residential buildings, the department may approve, on a case-by-case basis, requests to waive the asbestos survey requirement of OAR 340-248-0270(1). The owner or operator of the residential building must submit a written request to the department, along with supporting documentation that demonstrates to the department’s satisfaction that a survey is not warranted.
Since DEQ allows a case by case evaluation under demolitions why can they not allow it for renovations for residential building.
And renovations- was added to this rule.
Thank you
