Bill,Farmer,,Farmers table grapes,Oregon,"Yes, include the 3 wheeled EV’s although there arent many yet",
Chris,Brown,czenob@hotmail.com,Holey Joe Engrng,OR,"I believe the DEQ should include 3 wheeled electric vehicles in the proposed rulemaking. There are 3 wheeled electric vehicles coming out and even some manufactured in Oregon. I believe this will boost the desire for these vehicles, help Oregon manufacturing, and help the environment as more people transition to electric vehicles.",
David,Moore,david_c_moore@yahoo.com,,OR,"I am opposed to this rule change. This will only serve to slow the adoption of electric vehicles as the general population will not buy three-wheeled vehicles but the few rebates applied to three wheeled vehicles will not be available for traditional vehicles with electric power trains. This addition is for a very small population that won't make much of an impact in the adoption of electric transportation.  Considering there is a limitation of funds available for this purpose, I don't think any funds should be spent from the fund on three wheeled vehicles.  Please do not adopt this proposal.",
Elizabeth,Purta,bethpurta@gmail.com,,OR,"Yes, do include the 3 wheels-vehicles.  The more electric vehicles we get on the roads and less gas consuming vehicles, the better.  Thank you for your efforts.",
Edward,Hurtley,ehurtley@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I am writing in support of the proposed rule update to the Electric Vehicle Rebate to include 3-wheel vehicles. This would be a great benefit to Oregon, as Eugene-based Aricomoto is just about to start full production of their 3-wheel EV.",
Jacob,Strandlien,kepesk@gmail.com,,Oregon,I'm 100% on favor of the change adding 3 wheelers to the program.  3 wheels EVs like the Arcimoto FUV deserve inclusion.,
Thomas,Jackman,thinkthis@gmail.com,,Oregon,"As long as range and performance requirements are met there is no reason to arbitrarily limit the vehicle rebate for light duty vehicles to just two wheels. Three wheeled vehicles are inherently safer and can be nearly as efficient, making them more desirable for many consumers. ",
Chris,Scruton,scrutonsafe@gmail.com,California Energy Commission,California,"Because 3-wheeled vehicles can be simpler, lighter, and less expensive than 4-wheel vehicles, while providing a large improvement in stability and safety over 2-wheeled vehicles, they can have an important role in Oregon’s transition to cleaner transportation.  Therefore, I encourage the Oregon DEQ to approve expansion of the zero-emission vehicle program to include 3-wheel vehicles.",
Jon,Miller,jonmiller82@gmail.com,Arcimoto,Oregon,"Yes, absolutely. 3-wheel vehicles have a smaller footprint, are easier to park, ease congestion, and are much more efficient than four-wheel vehicles. This category is going to explode in the coming years, and we should include three-wheel vehicles so Oregon may benefit. ",
Dennis,Iverson,dsbjiverson@comcast.net,,Oregon,I support the proposed change to extend the eligible vehicles to include those with 3 wheels.  I hope to purchase an Arcimoto and knowing that Oregon supports this idea in its policies will help sway my decision.  The key for me is that I would use a 3 wheel vehicle as my everyday vehicle and it would replace a car for the vast majority of my trips.  Thanks for being progressive when it comes to lowering energy and emissions. ,
Katalin,Pusztavari,k@kathyandcalvin.com,,Oregon,This would tip our decision to purchase a 3 wheeled vehicle for household use - a “grocery go getter.” We are interested in the Oregon designed and manufactured Arcimoto. This could really help the fledgling company become fully viable.,
Steven,Ingham,ingham5@yahoo.com,Private individual ,Oregon,"I have test driven a 3 wheeled EV to manufactured in Eugene Oregon. It should qualify for a rebate. Being the battery needed to power it is much smaller than a regular EV, that should be taken into account. Range is the important factor, not battery size. It should qualify for a full rebate making it a great choice for lower income person's first EV. I have driven 60000 all electric miles to date.  ",
