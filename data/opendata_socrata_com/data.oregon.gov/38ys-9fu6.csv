OPRD is directed by statute (ORS 390.855) to periodically study new waterways for potential inclusion in the program. OPRD completed a study of a reach of the Molalla River in 2014. Based on the study's evaluation of eligibility and public input finding, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Commission directed OPRD to pilot test a draft management plan prior t o forwarding their recommendation of the Molalla River to the governor. 

The draft scenic waterway management plan advisory committee is meeting to kick off the draft management plan on April 20, 2015 from 6-7:30 p.m. at the Molalla Public Library (201 E.5th St, Molalla). This is an advisory committee work session, but the public is invited to observe. The draft scenic waterway management plan will review the existing conditions of the proposed portion of the Molalla River and recommend the assignment of scenic waterway classifications for segments of the river. There are (6) types of scenic waterways classifications. The definition allows for management goals to be established for each segment based off of classification and other management recommendations.

Fish and Wildlife Department,State Fish and Wildlife Commission Meeting,The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission will set ocean salmon and Pacific halibut seasons and discuss the status of wolves when it meets in Bend on April 24,04/24/2015 08:00:00 AM,04/24/2015 05:00:00 PM,"Deschutes National Forest Office, 63095 Deschutes Market Rd.", Bend,OR,"The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission will set ocean salmon and Pacific halibut seasons and discuss the status of wolves when it meets in Bend on April 24.

The meeting will begin at 8 a.m. at Deschutes National Forest Office, 63095 Deschutes Market Rd., Bend, OR 97701. See the full meeting agenda here: http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/15/04_April/index.asp

The Commission will be asked to set the 2015 ocean salmon and Pacific halibut seasons for Oregon’s territorial waters from shore to three miles out. The seasons in ocean waters beyond three miles already have been set by the Pacific Management Council, and the Commission will consider similar regulations for state waters. In addition, recreational and commercial troll fall Chinook salmon target fisheries in state waters only will be considered for waters adjacent to Tillamook Bay, the Elk River, and the Chetco River.

Due to another year of strong returns of Sacramento and Klamath fall Chinook salmon stocks, ocean Chinook seasons south of Cape Falcon are similar to the relatively robust seasons of recent years. The proposed 2015 ocean salmon seasons are listed on the ODFW Website.

For Pacific halibut, the total 2015 catch limit will be 970,000 pounds, one percent more than in 2014. There are a few changes to the 2015 regulations that affect the sport fisheries:
•A shift of some harvest allocations from the Columbia River Subarea (north of Cape Falcon) and to the Southern Oregon Subarea to better match allocations with recent effort and catches.
•In the Columbia River Subarea the all-depth fishery is combined into a single season beginning in May and running four days a week through September, or until the harvest allocation is attained. Also in this area, the nearshore fishery allocation is reduced to 500 pounds.
•In the area north of Humbug Mt., retention of other flatfish species (such as flounder, sole and sanddabs) when Pacific Halibut are on board is allowed.

The proposed 2015 Pacific halibut seasons are posted on the ODFW Website.

Also, the Commission will be asked to appoint three new members to the Fish Screening Task Force –one to represent agriculture and two to represent fishing/fish conservation. The seven-person task force is appointed by the Commission to advise ODFW staff on fish screening program development, funding and project prioritization.

ODFW staff will present its Biological Status Review for the Gray Wolf in Oregon to the Commission. The state’s Wolf Plan calls for initiating a process to delist wolves from the state Endangered Species Act when Oregon reaches the conservation objective of four breeding pairs for three consecutive years in eastern Oregon. This objective was met in early 2015. 

The Commission will use the Biological Status Review to evaluate whether to move forward with a delisting process. If they decide to do so, a final decision is still several months away, as delisting requires a public process.

“Wolves are a success story in Oregon. Their population is growing and their range is expanding,” said Russ Morgan, ODFW wolf coordinator. “The state’s Wolf Plan has measures to protect wolves into the future should the Commission decide to initiate a delisting process.”

Highway 101 bisects the park, with trails on both sides of the highway and a pedestrian overpass connecting them. Oregon Parks and Recreation Department recently reviewed the status of an unofficial trail that hikers and runners use to cross the highway at grade. Officials are expanding their review to cover the entire trail system and how best to connect the two sides of the park, taking into consideration the pedestrian overpass that opened in 2005. 

The meeting will be an opportunity for trail users to share ideas on safely crossing the highway, best routes, trailheads, destinations and recreation needs. Comments will be used to update and refine the preliminary concepts laid out for the trail system in the 2009 master plan. 

The public is also invited to comment online at honeymanstatepark.com; by email at jaime.english@oregon.gov; by phone at 503-986-0723; or by mailing written comments to Jaime English, OPRD, 725 Summer St. NE, Suite C, Salem, OR 97301.

Fish and Wildlife Department,Oregon Fish & Wildlife Commission Hearing,"The Fish and Wildlife Commission will meet Friday, June 5 in Salem to finalize controlled hunt tags for the 2015 hunting season and set coastal coho fisheries.",06/05/2015 08:00:00 AM,06/05/2015 05:00:00 AM,"ODFW Headquarters in the Commission Room, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE", Salem,OR,"The Fish and Wildlife Commission will meet Friday, June 5 in Salem to finalize controlled hunt tags for the 2015 hunting season and set coastal coho fisheries.

The meeting begins at 8 a.m. at ODFW Headquarters in the Commission Room, 4034 Fairview Industrial Drive SE. The agenda is online at, http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/commission/minutes/15/06_june/index.asp

The first order of business for the Commission will be finalizing 2015 controlled hunt tags and considering some changes to 2016 Big Game Regulations (though final 2016 regulations won’t be adopted until October 2015). ODFW staff are proposing that 137,015 controlled hunt big game tags be available this fall.

Major changes under consideration for the 2016 hunting season include:
•A new “premium hunt” series that would offer an opportunity to draw an additional deer, elk, or pronghorn tag with a longer season. These tags would be very limited but available in most areas. Tags would be allocated through the regular controlled hunt draw process but would not use preference points.
•Shift Wendling Travel Management Area (TMA) time period from the start of archery season (when fire danger often limits access) through the end of the rifle buck season, to the opening of the general rifle buck deer season-Nov. 30.
•End Eagle Creek TMA on Willamette National Forest due to low usage by elk and hunters.
•Change renewal period for hunters with a disability permit from every two years to every five years.
•Consider new and maintenance cougar target areas to reduce cougar damage to livestock, limit human safety problems, and reduce impacts on ungulate populations.

The Commission will also be asked to set coastal wild coho salmon seasons for coastal rivers. Wild coho fisheries have been proposed in 12 basins, in addition to Siltcoos and Tahkenitch lakes.

Under the proposed regulations, anglers will be able to harvest wild coho from the Tillamook, Nestucca, Siletz, Yaquina, Alsea, Siuslaw, Umpqua, Coos and Coquille rivers, Beaver and Floras creeks and Tenmile lakes (Siltcoos and Tahkenitch lakes remain open under permanent regulations).

Due to projected low returns, the Nehalem River would be closed to wild coho harvest in 2015, but anglers will be able to keep hatchery coho.

Daily and seasonal bag limits in open areas will be similar to recent years.  Because fewer Endangered Species Act (ESA) impacts are available in 2015, season lengths in some basins will be shortened compared to 2013 and 2014.  All proposed coho fisheries must be reviewed and approved by NOAA.

The 2015 Coastal Coho Fishing Regulations will be posted on the ODFW website after Commission approval.

For the first time in several years, there will be no emergency regulations for coastal fall Chinook. Anglers should refer to the 2015 Oregon Sport Fishing Regulations for those seasons.

In other business, the Commission will:
•Allocate 2016 big game raffle and auction tags among sportsman conservation groups and consider funding for A and H projects that provide hunting access or improve wildlife habitat. 
•Set the July 2015 - June 2016 commercial seasons for coastal pelagic species.
•Approve funding for one fish enhancement and one restoration project recommended by the Fish Restoration and Enhancement Board.

The Commission is the policy-making body for fish and wildlife issues in the state. Public testimony for topics not on the agenda will be held first thing Friday morning, just after the adoption of temporary rules. Persons seeking to testify on issues not on the formal agenda may do so by making arrangements with the ODFW Director’s Office, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, by calling 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044.

Reasonable accommodations will be provided as needed for individuals requesting assistive hearing devices, sign language interpreters or large-print materials. Individuals needing these types of accommodations may call the ODFW Director’s Office at 800-720-6339 or 503-947-6044 at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting.

Downloadable file: Honeyman State Park manager Daniel Schewlakow captures the experience of crossing Highway 101 using an unofficial trail.
Florence, OR--Providing safe pedestrian crossing of Highway 101 at Honeyman State Park will be discussed at a public meeting set for 5:30-7:30 p.m. on June 18 at Siuslaw Valley Fire and Rescue's upstairs meeting room, 2625 Highway 101 N., Florence. The meeting is a follow-up to a May 27 meeting on the same topic. 

Planners will share findings from the first meeting, summarized at honeymanstatepark.com. Alternatives for trail development and management, including alternatives for crossing Highway 101, will also be discussed. 

Highway 101 bisects the park, with trails on both sides of the highway and a pedestrian overpass connecting them. Hikers and runners also use an unofficial trail that crosses the highway at road level. Planners are in the process of reviewing the entire trail system and how best to connect the two sides of the park. 

The meetings are an opportunity for trail users to share ideas on safely crossing the highway, best routes, trailheads, destinations and recreation needs. Comments will be used to update and refine the concepts laid out for the trail system in the 2009 master plan. 

The public is also invited to comment online and participate in a short survey at honeymanstatepark.com. Comments can be made by email at jaime.english@oregon.gov; by phone at 503-986-0723; or by mail to Jaime English, OPRD, 725 Summer St. NE, Suite C, Salem, OR 97301.

The permit incorporated new requirements based on rules adopted in 2009 and 2012. The May 1, 2014 permit contained new conditions that addressed the concerns that DEQ heard from the public at a public hearing held on Oct. 30, 2013 and during the public comment period which ended on Nov. 20, 2013. One condition that DEQ included in the permit was a composting pile height restriction limiting pile heights to 30 feet. On May 16, 2014 Grimm’s appealed the permit stating concern with the pile height restriction.  
As a result of the appeal, Grimm’s Fuel has been operating under an older, expired permit that remains in effect until DEQ issues a new permit. By proposing a revised permit, DEQ withdraws the permit issued on May 1, 2014. The proposed permit no longer contains a pile height restriction. Instead the proposed permit requires Grimm’s to monitor for the following parameters throughout the composting piles: oxygen level, temperature, moisture content, and retention time. The permit also requires an updated odor minimization plan. These permit requirements will more accurately demonstrate whether Grimm’s is meeting regulatory requirements than a permit condition that restricts composting pile height.
