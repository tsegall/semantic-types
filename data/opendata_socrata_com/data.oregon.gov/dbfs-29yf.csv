The proposed rule amendment removes board certification as a qualification for a podiatric physician to perform ankle surgery, but retains the surgical residency requirements. The amendment provides parity between the American Board of Foot and Ankle Surgery and the American Board of Podiatric Medicine. The proposed rule would not impact the credentialing and privileging requirements established by hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.
The OMB is extending the public comment period and will take oral comments on the proposed rule at a public hearing via videoconference on Tuesday, August 23, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Written comments will be accepted until 5 p.m. on August 24, 2022. To participate in the public hearing, see the rulemaking information sheet.

Based on public comments during this rulemaking, the updated draft rule proposes requiring a universal offering of a medical chaperone during all breast, genital, and rectal examinations, no matter the medical specialty. The updated proposed rule would allow a patient to decline the offer a chaperone, but it should be explained that the chaperone is an integral part of the clinical team whose role includes protecting the patient and the provider. If the patient declines, the updated draft rule would allow the OMB licensee to defer the examination for the protection of the patient and the licensee.
