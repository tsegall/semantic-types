James,Neu,jjneusies2@gmail.com,350eugene,Oregon,"Clean Air Oregon Rulemaking Department of Environmental Quality Public Comment; August 5, 2018 Polluters should not be able to contaminate our air at the expense of the public’s health. Rules adopted by the EQC must be health based and follow Precautionary Principle, uphold principles of Environmental Justice to protect vulnerable communities, and establish standards to protect children’s health.  The proposed draft rules fail to include guidance, standards and best practices for protecting at risk and vulnerable populations. The DEQ needs to identify, address and take action to protect the health of the most at risk and vulnerable members of the community who are exposed to air toxics. The DEQ must require community engagement meetings if an owner or operator requests Source Risk Limits greater than any of the Community Engagement Levels.  Setting stringent levels for the Toxic Reference Values and the Risk Based Concentrations are the key to achieving health based regulations. However, DEQ has not yet committed to use the lowest protective benchmarks to determine what constitutes compliance with a health based regulation. Therefore, DEQ should establish a Cancer Risk of no greater than 10 in 1 million and a Hazard Index of no greater than HI-1. Cleaner Air Oregon’s focus does not necessarily focus on the control of air toxics. Requirements can also include eliminating hazardous materials brought onsite and used in manufacturing. The EQC should mandate requirements for industrial polluters to implement an upstream toxic use reduction strategy in addition to downstream control technology.  Under OAR340-245-0130(6), the DEQ has allowed too much latitude for facilities to implement their Risk Reduction Plans. A polluter could potentially be allowed 5 years to implement their Risk Reduction Plan, while the affected community breaths toxic air. DEQ should limit delay to a 2 year time frame. This will benefit the industry and public concern by providing clear expectations, requirements and timelines.",
Beth,Blenz-Clucas,bethbcpr@yahoo.com,,OR,Clean air regulations like this work. I've seen them create dramatically better air in California despite a huge increase in population since the 1970s. Oregon touts itself as a green state. Let's prove it with better  rules on industrial pollutants.,

Melissa,Rehder,misslissr@yahoo.com,,OR,"* Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) must place requirements on their own response time in the permitting process. This will help close the loophole of putting off compliance until the benchmarks sunset. This strict timeline will benefit industry and public concern by providing clear requirements and timelines.  * Please define what “cost effective” means for (best available control technology)T-BACT. This must be an agreed upon term and not another loophole for industry.  * We also ask you support lowest achievable emissions rate (LAER) for new facilities. LAER was brought up early on in the CAO process.  * The small business exemption must be eliminated. Small business is often a big polluter as we have seen in the case of Bullseye.  * Get rid of potential loopholes in the draft rules by eliminating permissive language. Rules should be rules and not loopholes. When using the word “may”, DEQ should provide a limitation on the discretion.  * Use the most recent and health protective value when examining emissions. Anything less is not health protective. A hazard index (HI) of 1 should be the only hazard index entertained. By definition a HI over 1 is a hazard. Period.  * Remember the cancer levels set in SB 1541 are in addition to the already high background cancer levels. In Portland I believe they are already at least 89 in a million. New levels set by CAO will be in ADDITION to that already heavy burden.  * Our most vulnerable community members bear the brunt of the additional cancer risk and non cancer risk. Protecting the most vulnerable communities first will benefit all. When the most vulnerable are protected we are all protected. An environmental justice lense must be the primary lense when implementing and enforcing the rules.  * Enforcement of rule on potential to emit should be a priority. This will create regulatory certainty for industry as they plan for the future in terms of their emissions controls. It is also a wise land use move and will allow new industry certainty when they are choosing placement of their facility and addresses cumulative impact in a way. It will give the public reassurance. Business is growth driven, to not plan for growth is short sighted when we think about actual emissions to potential emissions.  * Since DEQ is now funded the public urgently needs our agencies to utilize the most health protective science available; we have been told that DEQ just doesn’t have the resources to do this- but with the funding of DEQ via SB 1541 we disagree. The public will hold Oregon Health Authority (OHA) accountable to their duty to protect public health which means using the most up to date science.  * Air monitoring should be mandatory and done on a surprise basis. Requiring air monitoring is the first step in restoring public trust. If we don’t know what we are breathing and how much, how is any rule going to be effective? It will also be a good foil against emissions inventories and a way to see if results line up in terms of what industry says they are emitting and what they are emitting.",
Debra,Lowenthal,DebL2602@aol.com,,OR,"DEQ needs all rules to be responsive to the public health and public concerns before considering industry effects. DEQ should be definitive about terminology like ""cost efective"", and best practices, and health standards. Health standards used should be the most recent protective science available and the strictest. Anything else is allowing damage to the public's health and our environment. A Hazard Index over 1 is too much and should not be allowed. You should not allow any grandfathered pollution regulation loopholes.",

Yes, it is important to have a robust business community - but to what end if some in that community end up poisoning the environment?  And then the public gets to pay for the clean up after the pollution takes place. Ridiculous!!  Make the rules strong and unwavering and business WILL adapt.  As a business owner I have had to adapt to government rules over the years and those rules made my business better.

Cleaner Air Oregon has the power to not only control air pollutants but eliminate hazardous materials at the source so we can deal with the problem at the source. The DEQ should adequately fund and use the TURWRA program for its purpose of reducing toxics before they get into our air and lungs. The DEQ must include strict standards and best practices in this new rule. Lastly, we need the DEQ to put a strict timeline in place to hold businesses accountable for reducing their air pollution.

The perpetrators tell you that the spray is harmless, but that is a lie.  Most of the sprays contain permethrin piperonyl butoxide, the same pesticides as in the shampoos for head lice in children.  Is it harmless.  No way.  My doctor works in emergency rooms.  She has told me horror stores about children being brought into the emergency room in convulsions after having their hair washed in the stuff.  There is much documentation of this chemical causing lliver cancer in cats, and brain lesions in children.  There is ongoing research of these chemicals causing birth defects in children.  Perpetrators should not be able to poison the air and water by spraying pesticides in the forest just to make the trees grow a little faster.

Vivian ,Christensen,vivianchristensen.pdx@gmail.com,,Oregon,"I live in Southeast Portland in a neighborhood that sits near a group of large-scale and small-scale industrial facilities. We are exposed to toxins such as nickel, chromium, and styrene.  In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts, based on Toxic Release Inventory Data, found that my neighborhood school, Duniway Elementary, ranked in the 3rd highest percentile of exposure to toxins. Put another way, of approximately 128,000 schools in the United States that were examined, only 3,000 schools have worse air quality.   In its current form, Cleaner Air Oregon does very little to help neighborhoods like mine. Delaying the time for polluters, except the 80 polluters that have been deemed the top polluters in the state, to adopt the proposed regulations, increasing the cap on cancer to 500 per million people, and increasing the Hazard Index for chronic non-cancer diseases related to industry exposure from 1 to 30 is disingenuous and is NOT what most would call “health-based regulation.”  This is basically business as usual and does very little to help those who have shouldered the burden of Oregon’s unregulated industrial legacy.  We can do better than this.     Please make Oregon a leader in environmental health regulation.  We can no longer afford to be beholden to industry’s false claims that increased regulations will cause job loss.  Oregonians deserve clean, healthy air – our children are depending on it.

I place frequent calls to DEQ to no avail. Frequently I read news stories about how industrial emitters in N Portland have broken laws, emitted beyond allowable standards, REMOVED required scrubbers, and never been held accountable by DEQ. It's pathetic. I urge you to not only set much more stringent standards for emissions , and also urge DEQ to do a better job of implementing and enforcing the existing ones.

I understand this will be taken up during phase two rulemaking of CAO during the Technical Advisory Committee setting the HI for chemicals with “developmental, neurotoxic and other serious health effects” as allowed by SB 1541.

Gregory,Sotir,gsotir@cullycleanair.org,Cully Air Action Team,Oregon,"Lastly, CAAT reminds DEQ and the State that the health of the local community affected by industrial polluters is the primary purpose of this CAO regulatory framework, and whether the cost for treatment of ailments, or providing wrap-around care for sickened children and other individuals, is borne by the State or the polluter is what is of consequence here. CAAT advocates that the polluter should bear the burden, for if they are knowingly pushing toxins into community airsheds, they must be held accountable by the State. These toxins have created negative health effects, such as asthma in children, and are indicated as causative for cancers, autism, neurological disorders, and many other illnesses and diseases which limit life, cause immense suffering, and cost the State a huge amount in associated heath-care costs. The negative effects of airborne pollutant sedimentation and bioaccumulation in Oregon wildlife, local flora and fauna, and home gardens and farms are also of great concern to CAAT.   The remedy for these injuries would be best accomplished by: 	  	eliminating the loopholes mentioned above regarding 340-245-0160; 	  	conducting unannounced, surprise, monitoring visits to industrial polluters; 	 	and, requiring all industrial polluters to use TBACT filtering and capture devices 			for pollutants.

mysti,Frost,mfrost@beyondtoxics.org,Beyond Toxics,OREGON,"My name is Mysti Frost. I have lived in the Eugene area for over 15 years. My grandparents moved here in 1980 and bought a farm just outside of Cottage Grove. I am currently an Environmental Justice Community Organizer for Lane County for Beyond Toxics. I have great concerns about the air quality in our State and its effects on children.  This is my story: I moved here because I thought Oregon was a clean healthy state to raise my child. Eugene looks very green and healthy compared to my birth town, Billings MT. My father, being a member of the Crow Tribe had a small house just outside the Crow reservation. This house was built by his father when nothing else was built in that area of town. Then, a sugar beet factory was built just a short distance away. I still remember the horrid stench of the air. It would make me gag and run inside my house and close all the windows. It gave me headaches and nausea. Sometime later I developed asthma. My parents, being low income could not afford the expensive asthma medication. As a kid I experienced asthma attacks so severe I thought I would die. I don’t wish this on any other child. The desperation I felt as a small child gasping for air, searching all over my house for an inhaler, hoping there would be a bit more medicine left inside accompanied by shame and guilt i felt when i had to inform my parents they would have to scrape of the funds for my medicine again and again for years! This is an experience I could have lived without.  As I got older I learned about air pollution and then I investigated air pollution emitted by sugar beet factories. I was not surprised to find that sugar beet factories, along with the horrid stench, emit hydrogen sulfide. It is well documented now, that Hydrogen Sulfide has many human health risks. Asthma being one of them. This is the typical environmental justice story. A polluting industry moves into a minority community, dumps their toxins and never pay the consequences.  I am pretty sure that the sugar beet factory will never know the suffering they caused my family and I.  Polluting businesses often use job loss as their cover or reason not to invest in cleaner technology. They place the burden on their employees, threatening their jobs if they should have to comply with new regulations. What about the burden placed on my family and I? What about the burden on West Eugene families? In West Eugene we have factories that emit toxic chemicals into the air that rain down on neighborhoods. Childhood asthma in West Eugene is at 14%. Nearly double the state average.  Please keep in mind that early exposure can lead to cascading harm over a life time. Children are more susceptible to the harmful effects of chemicals and deserve additional protection from regulators. There is already a precedent for lower thresholds to protect children in toxicology models. We know that you know the science is here to back up the work you need to do. Now the question is a moral one.  I was recently nominated and elected to be on the board of directors of LRAPA. I look forward to working with you in the future to protect our children and public health in general. I have attached a document made by Beyond Toxics that DEQ may be interested in. It basically shows Eugene polluting industries, the chemicals they emit and the human health hazards associated with the chemicals.

It is also a wise land use move and will allow new industry certainty when they are choosing placement of their facility and addresses cumulative impact in a way. It will give the public reassurance. Business is growth driven, to not plan for growth is short sighted when we think about actual emissions to potential emissions. * Since DEQ is now funded the public urgently needs our agencies to utilize the most health protective science available; we have been told that DEQ just doesn’t have the resources to do this- but with the funding of DEQ via SB 1541 we disagree. The public will hold Oregon Health Authority (OHA) accountable to their duty to protect public health which means using the most up to date science. * Air monitoring should be mandatory and done on a surprise basis. Requiring air monitoring is the first step in restoring public trust. If we don’t know what we are breathing and how much, how is any rule going to be effective? It will also be a good foil against emissions inventories and a way to see if results line up in terms of what industry says they are emitting and what they are emitting. * Community engagement is paramount to creating a successful program. There needs to be an ombudsman or a person directly in charge of this to ensure meaningful implementation of this aspect of the program. * Transparency in regard to what people are breathing and where emissions and pollution is located should be a top priority. Access to the emissions inventory should be available online in a user friendly format.",

Carroll,Johnston,CarrollJ77@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Testimony about Cleaner Air Oregon proposed rules:  1.  A Hazard Index of 1 should be the upper limit for toxic emissions that will affect children.  Any higher value is by definition harmful to the population in general, and children are even more vulnerable than adults.  For our own government to sanction industrial child abuse is unconscionable.  2.  DEQ should hold itself to timelines of its own to ensure that emissions permits are are implemented and updated without allowing industries a loophole to evade compliance with better health standards for longer periods.  3. The term “cost effective” in relation to best available control technology should be defined and not be allowed to be a loophole for industry to avoid lowering their toxic emissions.  4. Small businesses should have toxic emissions rules that are as restrictive as those for large business.  The cumulative impact on health of many small businesses can be as much or more as one large business.  One high emitting small business can be worse than a well-run large business.  5. Define limits with more specificity so they do not become loopholes for avoiding regulation, as with the use of the word “may”.  6. Use the most recent and health-protective values for toxic emission limits.  Keep them updated as new science research finds that lower limits are needed.  7. Consider that cancer levels permitted by CAO are on top of already existing cancer levels.  We are not starting with a clean slate so the rules should be written and enforced accordingly.  8. Environmental justice for our most vulnerable populations should be front and center as the CAO rules are finalized and implemented.  9. Significant DEQ resources should go into air monitoring, “surprise” tests of toxic emissions, and monitoring of environmental impacts (toxins in soil, moss, wildlife, etc.) to ensure that toxic emissions do not go unreported or undetected as happened with the art glass factories.  Continuous emissions monitoring for toxins, as is done in Europe, should be a greater and greater priority goal as time passes.  10. Communications with communities affected by toxic emissions should be a high priority.  They should remain well informed about the toxins they are breathing, and DEQ and OHA should do all that they can to ensure that this happens.",
Katharine ,Salzmann,katharinesalzmann@gmail.com,member Eastside Portland Air Coalition ,Oregon,"  We have been working and commenting on Cleaner Air Oregon for over two years. When you “weight” this particular batch of comments please consider that what the general public wants has not changed: we want you to protect our health and the health of the environment from toxic pollution; we want strong, meaningful enforcement that results in the clean-up and preservation of our most valuable natural resources and that will HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE for decades of unchecked dumping into our common spaces; we want meaningful community engagement on the ground where we live, where it matters; we want agency transparency and we want to know what exactly you are permitting to go into our air, water and soil > accurate information leads to increased community engagement; we want our children’s health and the health of the places where we live, work and play at the center of every agency consideration and action.   I believe your team knows the right way to proceed. Please do not do anything to further weaken the health-protective capabilities of the proposed rules. Please anticipate and close any loopholes that may occur due to weak or unclear language.  Thank you for all your hard work creating these clean air rules. Thank you for striving to make this an open, transparent and accessible process. I hope DEQ will continue to improve its efforts to put vulnerable and impacted communities at the center of all agency activities. Thank you for taking seriously your mission to preserve, protect and enhance Oregon’s land, air and water for future generations. Thank you for treating the legacy and accumulations of human-made pollution with the utmost seriousness and for putting all your muscle and regulatory power into making polluting industries begin to bear the burden of that toxic legacy.
