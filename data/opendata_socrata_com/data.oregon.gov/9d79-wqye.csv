OAR-603-053 currently puts the Oregon Department of Agriculture out of compliance with this agreement. Increased revenue generated from this fee increase will help pay for administrative costs of the program, as well as yearly continuing education for auditors and accreditation and audit fees for certification programs.

The ODA proposes a revised fee schedule as follows: change the minimum hourly charge from $75 to $92, with a 4 hour minimum of service. Additionally, it proposes application fees for the National Organic Program certification program at $250 for new organic applicants and $100 yearly renewal application fee for returning customers to cover the administrative cost and accepting and reviewing organic applications before inspection and audit fees can be billed. Additionally, as the Department has begun to offer Global Food Safety Initiative benchmarked audits, a certification fee is proposed to be charged per certificate to cover technical review and administrative costs of this program.","through May 14, 2012, 5:00 PM","Sue Gooch","503-986-4583","sgooch@oda.state.or.us",,,,,,,,,,
