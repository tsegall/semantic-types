Charlie ,Peters,cappcharlie@earthlink.net,Clean Air Performance Professionals,California,"Voluntary GMO fuel may reduce CO2, ozone & NOx
in 2016.

Monopoly patent mandate may lower BP-DuPont stock value and profit while a move to voluntary may improve employee and customer relationship with improved profit. Win-Win outcome.

MTBE is in our water and a pain to oil profit. Is it time to check California water for fuel ethanol? Time for food & AB32 climate change performance? Time for an AG conversation for consideration of a California fuel ethanol waiver?

UN supports voluntary GMO fuel, a waiver.

Carrie,Nyssen,cnyssen@lungmtpacific.org,American Lung Association in Oregon,Oregon,"American Lung Association in Oregon strongly supports the proposed rules for the Oregon Clean Fuels Program. These rules will move forward our mission of saving lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease.

Too many Oregonians are exposed to unhealthy air pollution, in part because of our dependence on fossil fuels. Accelerating the use of clean fuels is a vital public health strategy to reduce exposure to bad air. Taking action to reduce our greenhouse emissions is a health win for our children, the elderly and other vulnerable populations who live with the ongoing challenges of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic illnesses made worse by dirty air.

Inaction is not acceptable. Continuing to release greenhouse gases into our atmosphere contributes to warmer temperatures and facilitates the formation of ozone which is harmful for all Oregonians to breathe. Warmer temperatures also means a longer pollen season that affects quality of life for those with asthma and allergies. Air pollution from cars, trucks, buses and freight transportation leads to illness and premature death, especially for those living near busy roadways.
 
The Clean Fuels Program is a vital strategy to address serious public health impacts from air pollution. It will result in the development and deployment of cleaner alternative fuels, reducing Oregonâ€™s unhealthy dependence on polluting petroleum fuels.

American Lung Associationâ€™s expertise does not lie in the technical details of the program, but we want to signal our strong support yet again, and urge that the program move forward in a way that results in real reductions in emissions as well as real improvements in our air.

Cleaner fuel choices means less pollution, less soot and less smog â€“ and thatâ€™s good for the health of all Oregonians.

Shannon,Baker-Branstetter,sbaker-branstetter@consumer.org,Consumers Union,DC,"As a national consumer organization with subscribers and activists in every state, Consumers Union cares deeply about fuel costs to power our vehicles and providing consumers with cleaner, more efficient choices.  Working towards this goal, we have supported federal and state fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for vehicles as well as state initiatives to enhance choices for vehicles and fuels.  

Consumers Union supports the recent set of rules proposed for the Oregon Clean Fuels Program. We applaud programs that reduce emissions and fossil fuel consumption because they are an effective way for consumers to save energy and to advance clean energy technology, while reducing greenhouse gases and other air pollutants from gasoline and diesel.

Petroleum is a finite resource, the price of which depends on a number of factors beyond any stateâ€™s control, such as refinery fires and international political instability. By diversifying the fuel supply, the Clean Fuels Program can help protect Oregon businesses and Oregonian drivers from volatile fuel prices. Independent analysis estimates that the program could save consumers tens of millions of dollars to upward of $1.6 billion.  

The Oregon Clean Fuels Program encourages clean energy investments in the local economy, supporting projects to sustainably convert waste products and biomass into transportation fuels and electrify the transportation system. It can help put Oregonians to work and help Oregon transition to a new clean energy economy with improved air quality.
From a consumer standpoint, we are especially interested in the rulemaking components that streamline the process and create efficiencies; thus we support synchronizing as much as possible with Californiaâ€™s program, such as adopting the same carbon intensity models and reporting tools. 

In summary, Consumers Union supports the Clean Fuels Program because it is likely to save consumers money on their fuel bills, increase vehicle and fuel choices, and improve air quality and public health.  We thank the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality for its work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality through the Oregon Clean Fuels Program. Thank you for listening to our views.

Harrison,Pettit,harrison.pettit@pacificag.com,Pacific Ag. LLC,Oregon,"Dear Administrator,
PACIFIC AG (www.pacificag.com) is North Americaâ€™s leading ag biomass harvest and supply company.  Pacific Ag sustainably harvests ag residues for a diverse set of industries but helping lead the way as the key biomass supplier to two of three cellulosic biofuels plants now fully constructed and producing very low carbon fuels.   

We are highly supportive of the Clean Fuels Program but adamantly disagree with the draft ruleâ€™s treatment of ILUC, which we view as placing an unfair burden on agriculture given the indirect effects on other fuels.   Including the CARB ILUC is neither scientifically justified nor good, balanced policy.  
We recommend that no ILUC value be assigned until a greater scientific consensus and a more balanced approach to indirect effects is developed or Oregon should use the Argonne GREET model ILUC values, if some value must be applied today. 

As you are aware a recent study by Dr Bruce Babcock using empirical real world evidence shows the econometric assumption driven model of CARB to be grossly overstating land use emissions and activity.   Recent work by Argonne incorporated into the GREET model is much more consistent with the actual empirical data collected by Babcock.

We further recommend that Oregon apply regulatory methodology consistently across all fuels at the same time.  The current proposal adds a special indirect effect penalty to agricultural derived fuels while ignoring the indirect effects of other fuels such as crude oil, electricity and natural gas. As you are aware British Columbia decided against including indirect effects into regulation because of lack of scientific consensus and an unwillingness to apply the controversial values on a selective basis.   

Attached, you will find several papers, some collaborated on by Dr. Bruce Dale that further address some of the flaws with the CARB ILUC values and approach.

R Brooke,Coleman,bcoleman@advancedbiofuels.org,Advanced Biofuels Business Council,MA,"Hi. Please accept the attached letter for the record. Our Council supports carbon-based performance standards. However, we recommend a conservative approach when it comes to including ILUC penalties because: (a) the science is unsettled; and, (b) indirect effects are not assessed for all fuels to date. As such, it is critical for the credibility of the program to be extremely careful with this aspect of carbon accounting. The letter sets forth the argument and possible resolution in more details.
