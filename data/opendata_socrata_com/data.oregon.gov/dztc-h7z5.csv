Psychiatric Security Review Board,Rulemaking Hearing,PSRB Conditional Release Plan Review of Tier Two Offenders,03/22/2012 10:00:00 AM,,"620 SW 5th Ave, 4th Floor Conference Room", Portland,OR,"Section 11a of SB 420 (Act) classifies individuals who have been found guilty except for insanity into tier-one offenders (i.e. Measure 11 offenders) and tier-two offenders (i.e. non-Measure 11 offenders).  The Act directs that tier-two offenders who are committed to the state hospital be placed under the jurisdiction of the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), effective January 1, 2012.  After OHA orders tier-two offenders to be placed on conditional release, their jurisdiction transfers to the PSRB pursuant to Section 1 of the Act.  Section 5 of the Act directs OHA to notify PSRB prior to conducting a conditional release hearing.  The Act also permits PSRB to provide OHA with conditions of release that PSRB determines are advisable.    

PSRB’s current rules do not describe a permanent process for PSRB to provide conditions for release to OHA as described in  Section 5 of the Act. PSRB must adopt OAR 859-70-0040 to create such  a process.  The adoption of 859-70-0040 creates a procedure for  PSRB to begin considering and providing to OHA conditions for the release of tier-two offenders when OHA notifies it under Section 5 of the Act.  The amendments to 859-030-0005 and 0010 are necessary in order to update the Board’s existing administrative rules to reflect its new responsibilities as noted above as well as housekeeping changes to reflect the Oregon Health Authority’s new name.

The Board sets policy and oversees general operations. Every six years it develops a strategic plan to help guide DOGAMI’s mission and objectives.

The Board meets quarterly at sites around the state to encourage participation from the public, local government, industry and other geologists. Board members do more than attend quarterly meetings. DOGAMI Board members traditionally are active in their communities and provide an important link of communication: they hear what Oregonians are interested in and need, and can then help guide the department to the most effective use of limited resources.",,Carol DuVernois,(971) 673-1544,carol.duvernois@dogami.state.or.us,http://www.oregongeology.org/sub/portoff/GovBrd.HTM,http://www.oregongeology.org/sub/portoff/gmap-Portlandoffice.htm,,Carol DuVernois,(971) 673-1544,carol.duvernois@dogami.state.or.us,,,,http://www.oregongeology.org/sub/portoff/boardagenda-03-20-12.pdf,,,,
