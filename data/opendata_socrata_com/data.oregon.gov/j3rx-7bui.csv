Theresa,Koppang,,Washington County,Oregon,"Division 83
Materials Management Grant and Distressed County Rebates
OAR 340-083-0010

Washington County suggests that language be added to the proposed Grant Rules that:

Affected local governments will be notified, prior to the time of award, that a proposal from an applicant within the local governmentâ€™s boundaries has been submitted to DEQ.

Notification of grant project proposals, within Washington County, will provide county staff the opportunity to leverage its messaging and education efforts.",
Pamela,Allee,alleepa@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Proof of deconstruction (rather than pure destruction) could earn a reduction in tipping fees.  This would encourage conservation of materials and landfill space.  

I am interested in knowing if any other person or organization has suggested this, and if so, what is DEQ's response.",
