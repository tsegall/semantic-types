Details: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Oregon’s Medicaid 1115 Demonstration waiver renewal January 12, 2017. This was a huge step forward in Oregon’s health system transformation. It will allow the state to continue its innovative model of health care for OHP members and providers. The approval preserves more than two decades of work that have gone into building and improving the Oregon Health Plan.

As part of its regular public meeting, the Medicaid Advisory Committee and the Oregon Health Authority will offer Oregonians an opportunity to provide input on the waiver’s progress and how we can continue to move forward together toward a healthier Oregon. Oregon Health Plan members and the general public are invited to attend in person or participate online via the webinar.

OHA will accept public feedback in a variety of ways for this meeting:

Oregon’s coordinated care model was created in 2011 as part of Oregon’s ongoing health system transformation. The 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) deliver physical, oral and behavioral health services to nearly 90 percent of Oregon’s 1.1 million Medicaid recipients.

As part of the OHPB’s mission to improve and monitor community-centered health initiatives, it will analyze the current model for opportunities to further advance health system transformation and to inform the 2017 Oregon Legislature. OHPB will gather input from consumers, advocates, primary care providers, and other stakeholders, and then develop recommendations to the Legislature for continued system improvements toward the goal of providing Oregonians with better health and better care at a lower cost.

“We’re excited to hear directly from Oregonians who are served by or work with coordinated care organizations,” said Zeke Smith, chair of the Oregon Health Policy Board. “We want to hear ideas about how to better provide access to high-quality, affordable health care for all Oregonians.”
