The scope of this project would include eight blocks between Campbell Street and Auburn. The street itself is in poor condition, the only commercial street in Baker City to receive such a designation in our adopted Pavement Management Plan. Large sections of the base have failed, the asphalt is severely cracked and the sidewalks are crumbling. A major overhaul is needed to make this street a viable alternative for the community. The scope of work includes a complete rebuild of the street and construction of new sidewalks, including street trees and pedestrian lighting. Best Frontage Road Improvements.</P>
<P>Another essential piece of Baker City and County’s transportation infrastructure is the completion of Best Frontage Road. East of Interstate 84, Best Frontage Road provides a co<p>nnection between Baker City’s two busiest interchanges (302 and 304). The scope of the project would be phased, depending on available funding. Improvements would include construction of a new street with curbs, gutters and sidewalks built to Baker County City standards. A multi-use path would be constructed on one side of the street for bicycle and pedestrian use. Street lighting would also be placed where needed. Our preference would be to complete the street between Exits 302 and 304, providing a connection from Highway 86 to Campbell Street and Highway 7.

"Interstate 84 Spring Creek Climbing Lane","17087","The Interstate 84 Spring Creek Climbing Lane project is located in Union County and will construct a third lane between mile posts 246.6 and 248.1 westbound. At completion of the project, commercial vehicles would be restricted to the right lanes, keeping the left lane open to passenger vehicles. This allows passenger vehicles to proceed at posted speeds without delay when commercial vehicles overtake each other. In the winter this would also allow emergency and winter maintenance vehicles to navigate around trucks that have blocked the truck lanes. New 12-foot-wide travel lanes for trucks will be constructed of concrete to withstand wear and extend the life of the new roadway.","<P>The project would alleviate bottlenecks that occur when both lanes of the interstate are being used by commercial vehicles, serving to improve freight mobility and minimize delays for passenger vehicles.</P>
<P>The six percent westbound grade on I-84 at Spring Creek is a frequent and year-round bottleneck for freeway traffic. In the summer months the differential speeds between large vehicles and passenger vehicles creates traffic safety issues. When large vehicles overtake each other at slow speeds, traffic delays occur as passenger vehicles are delayed behind the slow moving vehicles. In the winter months, large vehicles frequently spin out on the grade which blocks the freeway. This section experiences frequent and lengthy winter related closures. The mountainous terrain precludes alternative routes for this section. As a result, the closures become a large burden to freight and passenger mobility through Eastern Oregon.</P>","The project is complete.

The project will also provide enhanced bicycle and pedestrian access across U.S. 97, which is currently limited, and reduce safety problems.</P>
<P>U.S. 97 is a designated freight route and the only major north-south route in Oregon east of the Cascade Mountains. U.S. 97 plays a key role for travel to and within Central Oregon, and it also serves through traffic from California to Washington. ODOT has invested significant resources in improving U.S. 97 for freight and passenger travel, including building the Bend Parkway and the Redmond Reroute. Both of these projects created new alignments for U.S. 97 to offer a faster way for through traffic to travel through the region.</P>
<P>The southern section of the Bend Parkway was opened in 2001. Unlike the rest of the parkway, which features grade-separated interchanges, most of the intersections on the south end of the Parkway are at-grade with traffic signals. However, significant growth in the region-Bend was one of the fastest growing cities in the country for much of the last two decades-is adding pressure to an already congested transportation network. These at-grade intersections on the southern section of the Parkway slow travel and also create traffic conflicts and safety issues.  Recent planning efforts by ODOT and the City of Bend have determined that a new overcrossing should be built on U.S. 97 at Murphy Road. This would allow for removal of traffic signals on U.S. 97 at Pinebrook Boulevard and Third Street. The project will build out the transportation system in a rapidly-growing part of the region and allow for future economic development in the area by opening up access to undeveloped land within the city limits.</P>","The second of the first two phases of the Murphy Road Project, administered by ODOT, was completed December 15, 2015.

"Beltline Highway (State Highway 69) at Delta Highway","17072","The Beltline Highway is located in Lane County and is functionally obsolete and cannot handle current and future traffic volumes.   Following analysis, ramp meters were recommended at four locations to alleviate congestion and to improve safety on the Beltline Highway corridor through Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  ITS makes use of advanced communication and computer technology to improve the operation of a facility and enhance the movement of people and goods.<P>The project was to analyze, design, and construct ITS solutions along the Beltline Highway corridor where it could be adapted to work with a minimum of infrastructure changes and disruptions. ODOT, in collaboration with the City of Eugene and Lane County advanced the planning study recommendation of placing ramp metering at eastbound Beltline Hwy River Road and River Avenue on-ramps, and at Beltline Hwy westbound from Green Acres and Coburg Roads on-ramps.  Ramp metering from northbound Delta Highway to westbound Beltline was not included due to the lack of adequate ramp length for que storage.</P><P>  
The ramp designs were completed in the fall of 2012 and the project work was awarded to Lantz Electric Inc. of Eugene. Construction was completed at the four recommended locations in June of 2013. A ramp meter is a traffic signal on a ramp that controls the rate vehicles enter a freeway facility. Kittelson and Associates Inc., under a separate contract, has conducted performance evaluations of the four ramp meter locations to determine how effective they are at reducing congestion and improving safety.  Since the activation of the meters, ODOT has worked through and solved unexpected challenges with the systems adaptive software.   There has been a notable reduction in crashes with a 35% decrease from 2013 data.</P><P>
We are moving toward construction of a project at Beltline and Delta Highways Interchange as outlined in the Beltline Facility Plan.  The Oregon Transportation Commission has approved funding of $2.5 million for preliminary engineering for the interchange design. The consulting firm CH2M Hill has been hired to work with ODOT to confirm and refine the interchange design proposed in the Facility Plan.  Construction is anticipated in 2018.</P>","<P>The Beltline Highway (OR 569) carries the majority of traffic crossing the Willamette River and connects western Lane County to Interstate 5. Traffic moving onto and off of Beltline Highway between River Road and Coburg Road is slow and congested during busy travel times. A planning study was conducted to assess deficiencies on Beltline Highway between River Road and Coburg Road and recommended long-term solutions.  The complete list of infrastructure solutions to address deficiencies will take several years to develop and fund.</P><P>
The Delta interchange is functionally obsolete and cannot handle current and future traffic volumes.  Its intersection with Beltline Highway is a chokepoint in the daily operation of both facilities and is a safety priority site.  Improvements at the interchange include an expanded northbound Delta to westbound Beltline on-ramp along with other interchange improvements that will improve the capacity and operation of the facilities.</P>","<P>The initial project identified and installed Intelligent Transportation Systems at and near the Beltline and Delta Highway interchange.

<P> At the request of elected state representatives, and in the spirit of the JTA's emphasis on Practical Design, ODOT conducted a Value Engineering study of Unit 4 to reevaluate the design elements for cost savings and reduced impacts on right of way and utilities. Traffic analysis following the Value Engineering study concludes that I-5/Beltline will have adequate capacity to handle projected traffic volumes without the need of an additional auxiliary lane on eastbound Beltline, and without one additional lane for the ramp from eastbound Beltline to southbound I-5. The new analysis also shows no need for an additional southbound auxiliary lane on I-5 from Beltline to I-105 and, therefore, the Harlow Bridge will not require lengthening (replacement) at this time.  However, the west end of the bridge will be revised to allow for a southbound extension of the multi-use path.  Additional subsidiary design elements associated with the southbound I-5 auxiliary lane will be affected by the elimination of auxiliary lanes as well, as is the project time line. Construction is scheduled to occur in Spring, 2016.  Cost savings were re-programmed to the Beltline at Delta Highway project.

The project will provide an alternate route for local commuter and freight traffic around the congestion in Dundee and south Newberg, reducing the number of vehicles using Oregon 99W.  The HB 2001 project is being accomplished by two separate projects: Newberg-Dundee Improvement Project #1 and OR18: Newberg-Dundee Bypass.   The project is expected to construct a two-lane highway from Oregon 219, near Newberg, to Oregon 99W, southwest of Dundee.","<P>The goal is to reduce traffic congestion and improve regional and local transportation along the Oregon 99W corridor in the Newberg and Dundee area.</P><P>Oregon 99W serves as the “main street” for both Newberg and Dundee. It also connects the cities to the Portland Metropolitan Area, McMinnville and the Oregon Coast. Because this highway is the most direct route between the Willamette Valley and coastal communities, tourist traffic has steadily increased. Weekday commuters also use the highway to travel between Yamhill County and the Portland Metropolitan Area.</P><P>All of these demands combine to create severe congestion; lines of vehicles often stretch for over a mile in both directions. Congestion and travel delays have reached unacceptable levels for those who live, work in or travel through Newberg, Dundee and the surrounding areas.

"Interstate 84 at Hood River Interchange","17066","The Interstate 84 at the Hood River Interchange project is located at the east end of Hood River at I-84 mile post 64.4 in Hood River County, in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. The project began as a part of the OTIA III State Bridge Delivery Program and consisted of the replacement of one bridge and mading cross-road improvements.The project replaced the I-84 bridge at exit 64 over Button Bridge Road, which is the connector road to Oregon 35, and made safety improvements to the exit 64 interchange beneath the bridge. To reduce congestion and increase safety beneath the bridge, the project widened Button Bridge Road to five lanes with bike lanes in both directions and added a sidewalk to the east side of the roadway. Additionally, three traffic signals were added to Button Bridge Road: at the intersections of Marina Way and at the on- and off-ramps for eastbound and westbound I-84.","Interstate 84 is one of the state’s economic lifelines. It carries much of Oregon’s commercial truck traffic. If ODOT did not repair or replace the I-84 bridge at Exit 64, the agency would have been forced to place weight limits on it, a restriction that would impair this vital freight corridor. Built in 1953, the original bridge was replaced to safely accommodate overweight permit vehicles and keep traffic moving along the I-84 corridor.","Additional landscaping/irrigation work delayed the completion of the project; however, construction is now complete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Interstate 84 at 257th Interchange (Troutdale) Phases 2 and 3","17060","<P>Interstate 84 at the 257th Interchange, located in the City of Troutdale in Multnomah County, is an important freeway connection to many industrial businesses at the eastern end of the Columbia industrial corridor. The project will support connections to this important employment area by improving safety and capacity in the I-84/257th interchange area.<P><P>In July 2009, work began to improve the east end of the I-84 Troutdale interchange (Exit 17). The project, which was funded by ODOT, Port of Portland, City of Troutdale and federal stimulus funds, added an additional turn lane for traffic headed east on South Frontage Road to 257th Drive/NW Graham Road (I-84, Exit 17) and was completed in December 2009.</P>
<P>Project elements completed include: <ul>
<li> widening and lengthening the I-84 eastbound exit ramp, and improving the intersection; </li>
<li>adding a third lane to South Frontage Road; and </li>
<li> improving the intersection at the I-84 westbound exit ramp and Graham Road, including adding a third lane to a portion of North Frontage Road. </li>
<li> building a new I-84 overpass crossing over Marine Drive </li>
<li> widening Marine Drive to inlcude two-way traffic </li>
</ul></P> 
<P>Additional project elements will be designed with JTA funding. Construction of these additional project elements will depend on securing other funding, such as the Federal Transportation Reauthorization request for $28 million that ODOT, the Port of Portland and the City of Troutdale are supporting.</P>","<P>The interchange experiences traffic backups on the I-84 eastbound exit ramp during afternoon peak hours. This is a significant safety concern as vehicles are forced to back up into the travel lanes of the interstate. A recent traffic study, specifically addressing the increased traffic generated from the newsly constructed FedEx ground distribution facility, forecasts that congestion in the area will soon worsen. This project will improve safety, reduce congestion and provide capacity for future development of the Port's industrial property north of I-84.</P>","<P>This project is substantially complete and all new features are open to traffic. When weather allows, the contractor will finish permenent striping, perform work on the ramps to the sidewalks and landscaping.</p>

"U.S. Highway 26 at Glencoe Road Interchange","17059","<P>The U.S. 26 project at the Glencoe Road Interchange is located in the City of North Plains in Washington County. The project will improve safety and capacity of the interchange.</P>

<P><A href=""http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/JTA/images/001_GlencoeAERIAL.jpg"" TARGET=""IMAGE_WIN"">View an aerial photo of the project area.</a></P>The project, as originally developed in the Draft Interchange Area Management Plan several years ago, was estimated to cost $80 to $90 million.

<p>ODOT has worked with the City of North Plains and Washington County to develop a design concept that meets the $32 million budget provided by the JTA.  Project elements include:
<ul>
<li>Replacing the Glencoe Road bridge over U.S. 26 with a new, four-lane bridge, and improving vertical clearance</li>
<li>Lengthening and widening the U.S. 26 westbound exit ramp</li>
<li>Replacing the culvert on Glencoe Road to the north of the interchange with a new structure</li>
<li>Improving pedestrian and bicycle connections on the new bridge over U.S. 26</li>
<li>Improving intersections, including traffic signals, signing, striping, drainage and water quality</li>
</UL>","<P>The existing two-lane Glencoe Road over-crossing lacks adequate shoulders, turn lanes, and bicycle/ pedestrian accommodations. The most significant safety issue to be addressed is that the existing westbound off-ramp is not long enough to safely accommodate vehicles using the interchange, creating backups onto U.S. 26.</p>
<P>The U.S. 26 Glencoe Road Interchange project will serve the projected increase in traffic volumes, both from the adjacent City of North Plains and the larger regional vicinity, which includes the Cities of Hillsboro, Cornelius, and Forest Grove. The interchange is an important access point from U.S. 26 to these cities and the project will improve the capacity of the system and result in better mobility in the region.</P>
<P>The project will also contribute to economic development by supporting planned land use and industrial development in western Washington County.</P>","<p>This project is complete.</p>
