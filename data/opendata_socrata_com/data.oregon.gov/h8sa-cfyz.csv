Harry ,Foster,hfoster730@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Oregon Department of Environmental Quality:

I am writing today regarding the proposed water quality trading rules. I am very concerned that the proposed rules do not appear to include many basic elements to ensure protection of our public waterways, and look to avoid public scrutiny of pollution trades.

The rules do not place the primary emphasis on the protection of clean water, rather they start by focusing on economic incentives for the polluter. The proposed rules even go so far as allowing the polluter to write their own plan with very little clear guidelines from DEQ.

Water quality restoration plans (TMDLs) should be more clearly incorporated. These plans have specific assumptions regarding baseline site conditions that must be used properly in developing any permit to pollute, especially trades. 

The rules should identify all pollutants that DEQ is prepared to engage in trading for, rather than deferring to a case-by-case evaluation internally. If DEQ considers other pollutants safe for trading, they should all be outlined clearly in the rules.

Finally the rules do not give confidence that DEQ is able to clearly articulate what it considers acceptable in water quality trades by leaving all planning and assessment of how water quality would be benefited, how credit ratios are determined, and what methods are acceptable for monitoring success to the polluter.

DEQ should heavily revise the proposed rules â€“ or go back to the drawing board entirely â€“ to provide real certainty of expectations for polluters, and more detailed and effective protections for our waterways. The current proposal leaves the public out of the loop and polluters in the driverâ€™s seat, itâ€™s time for DEQ to take the wheel.

Re: Proposed changes to OAR 340, specifically proposal to adopt Division 039, Water Quality Trading Program rules


Dear Ms. Brown and the Environmental Quality Commission,

The Metro Regional Government strongly encourages the Department of Environmental Quality to adopt rules for water quality credit trading allowing for the maximum flexibility of mitigators to partner with conservation organizations and co-mingle funds to produce the greatest possible benefit for the people of Oregon, while separating investments made from dedicated conservation funding from those made from other funding sources for crediting.

Our agency has a 15,000 acre natural lands portfolio largely created using dedicated conservation funding.  We routinely collaborate with many other organizations in a region with a high demand for both mitigation and creative solutions to challenging environmental and economic issues.  We are acutely aware of the need for and benefits of partnership.  However, we also strongly believe that transparent accounting and the principle of additionality are important components in earning and maintaining the publicâ€™s trust regarding both mitigation and dedicating funds for conservation actions.

We believe that a solution exists that honors mitigators with good intentions, allowing them to leverage their investment for the public good, but does not result in de facto subsidies for development with limited dedicated conservation funding.

If we can be of assistance in finding creative solutions, please do not hesitate to contact our Parks and Nature Director, Kathleen Brennan-Hunter.

Sincerely,

Dan Moeller
Acting Director Conservation Program

John,MacDiarmid,jmacd@jeffnet.org,,Oregon,"Water Quality Trading should not allow degradation of the State's waters with a negative impact on beneficial uses.  Specifically in a stream, any trade benefit should be in place upstream of the waste load for which the trade is made.  For example the Medford WWTP is implementing a shading project to cool the receiving water, the Rogue River, in exchange for the thermal load in the discharge. This would be acceptable if the river were cooled before the thermal load is added to the stream.  Such is not the case.  It will take up to 60 miles of river downstream of of the discharge to find sufficient unshaded South Bank to improve and offset the WWTP thermal load. Water quality and beneficial uses will be sacrificed for 60 miles to accomplish this trade.  This is tantamount to a 60 mile mixing zone!  Each fall there are thousands of spawning Chinook Salmon in the upper portion of this 60 mile stretch starting at the High Banks Riffle just below the WWTP discharge.  The salmon eggs in those redds need cool water to develop properly, they are compromised with this ""trading.""",

Neil,Mullane,nmullane@msn.com,,Oregon," 
Overall the final draft rules are very good.  I think there remains one area where minor changes could be made to provide clarifications and avoid confusion in the future.
Draft rule OAR 340-039-0015(2)(b) states, â€œ Water quality trading for pollutants that are toxic and either persistent in the environment or accumulate in the tissues of humans, fish, wildlife or plants is prohibited.â€&#65533;  There is potentially a problem with this draft rule language if it prevents implementation of Draft rule OAR 340-039-0017(1)(c) which allows water quality trading as a component of pollution reduction plans developed under OAR 340-041-0059.  The extensive discussions held by the Oregon DEQ during development of OAR 340-041-0059 indicated that pollution reduction plans could be developed for toxic pollutants under the Departmentâ€™s new Human Health criteria.  There appears to be a potential conflict between a trading prohibition for toxics in one place in the rules and language that allows trading in pollution reduction plans under OAR 340-041-0059 which may include toxics in another. This potential draft rule language problem may be addressed by adding to Draft rule 340-039-0015(2)(b) after â€¦.prohibited, unless otherwise approved by the EQC or Department under OAR 340-041-0059.  
Draft rule OAR 340-039-0015(2)(D) may do this but there may be confusion between language stating a prohibition and then language allowing the Department to identify other pollutants.
Thank you for your consideration of this comment.

Joseph,Furia,furia@thefreshwatertrust.org,The Freshwater Trust,Oregon,"September 25, 2015,

The Freshwater Trust submits the following comment supplementing its comments submitted on September 11th, 2015.

While The Freshwater Trust does not support the use of public conservation funding to meet regulatory compliance obligations under the proposed OAR 340-039-0040 language, the organization does support the use of public conservation funds to improve and expand upon credit generating projects when the permittee can demonstrate that public conservation funds are not used to generate those credits. Such a transparent accounting is essential to demonstrate that actions funded by public conservation funds produce additional benefits beyond those provided by credit-generating actions. 

Sincerely,

Joseph A. Furia
Senior Policy Director and General Counsel
