Asset allocation modeling identifies the asset classes the System will utilize and the percentage of the total plan assets that each class represents.  Due to the fluctuation of market values, positioning within a specified range is acceptable and constitutes compliance with the policy.  It is anticipated that an extended period of time may be required to fully implement the Asset Allocation Policy and that periodic revisions will occur.  The Board monitors and assesses the actual asset allocation versus policy and will re-balance as appropriate.  The Board reviews the Asset Allocation Policy strategically approximately every three years and on a tactical basis when appropriate.","33","2020-07-13T14:49:00.000Z","2020-07-28T21:59:00.000Z","A Well Run City",,"26","m666-uncs",,"published","LACERS","https://www.lacers.org/reports-and-statistics",,"https://data.lacity.org/resource/ftgd-xwi4.json",,,,"Annual","No",,,"alombardo"
