Data is aggregated over a 1 month period, with the exception of April 2019, where data is aggregated from April 15 (deadline for formal compliance) to April 30. Vehicle deployment includes the individual instance a Dockless Mobility company locates a dockless vehicle in the public right of way. Dockless vehicles without a reported status change within 48 hours and vehicles with trips longer than 5 hours were excluded. For more information on vehicle deployment metric and the description of vehicle statuses, please visit the <a href=""https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification#mobility-data-specification"" target = ""_blank""> Mobility Data Specification Github</a> .

This dataset contains micromobility vehicle deployment data reported to the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) as part of the shared Dockless Mobility Pilot Program. This dataset will not be updated on a regular basis. LADOT captures shared dockless mobility vehicle and trip information using the Mobility Data Specification (MDS) API. MDS is an open-source project of the <a href=""https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/"" target=""_blank"">Open Mobility Foundation (OMF)</a>.
