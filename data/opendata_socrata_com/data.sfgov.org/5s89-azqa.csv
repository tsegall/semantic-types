"Vacant","6713044","2555 DIAMOND ST","0","PL Filed","2018-11-02","1","0",,"0",,,,"2018-015058PRJ","The project site is located on the east side of Diamond Street, approximately 200 feet south of the intersection with Moffitt Street, on a 2,500 square-foot upsloping lot in the Glen Park neighborhood. The lot is occupied by a 21-foot tall, one-story over basement, 1,500-gross-square-foot, single family residential building constructed in 1913, and a small outbuilding. The site is adjacent to single family residences on either side.  The proposed project would demolish the existing residential building and outbuilding, and construct a two-story, 37-foot-tall, 2,900 gross-square-foot residence over a basement. The proposed single-family home would have four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, including one bed and one bath on the basement level. 

The existing 486-square-foot basement is partially built into the grade of the lot and would be expanded to 718 square feet, by extending the basement 16 feet at the back to a depth of 11 feet below grade, and by extending the basement 5 feet towards the Diamond Street property line at existing grade, and would use existing retaining walls. The basement would provide one vehicle parking space, one Class I bicycle parking space, and would include one  bedroom and one bathroom.  

The proposed project would remove the existing nine-foot curb cut for the one-car garage, and construct a new 10-foot curb cut in the middle of the property for similar access.  The project proposes to remove the existing street tree located within the public right-of-way and would plant a street tree a few feet to the north of the existing location. Tree removal and replacement would be subject to requirements of the Urban Forestry Ordinance.

The lot contains areas with greater than 25 percent slope, and therefore the project may be subject to requirements of the San Francisco?s Slope and Seismic Hazards Zone Protection Act. The proposed project would require 75 cubic yards of excavation up to 11 feet below grade, as well as construction of a new retaining wall in the upslope portion of the backyard along the east property line. The geotechnical report specifies the proposed improvements can be supported on a mat foundation or a grid of interconnected footings. Where artificial fill or soft to medium stiff native soil is exposed, the proposed foundations should be deepened or drilled piers can be used to transfer the building loads to the underlying bedrock.

A Buddhist shrine and a meditation room serve as the main congregation spaces, accommodating a group of about 220 occupants during weekly ceremonies. An education center consisting of four classrooms and an auditorium will host community classes for children and adults.

The lot is L-shaped, with approximately 92 feet of frontage along North Point Street and approximately 46 feet of frontage along Larkin Street. There are three lots at the corner of Larkin Street and North Point Street that separate the two frontages. The site is moderately upsloping along Larkin Street, moving south from North Point Street to Bay Street. The project site is within a NC-1, Neighborhood Commercial Cluster District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

An approximately 29,400-square foot parking garage, constructed in 1925, currently occupies the project site. The garage frontage is two-stories tall on North Point Street. Along Larkin Street, the lower floor of the garage is semi-subterranean, such that the frontage is one story tall. Access to the garage is provided via a curb cut and vehicular entrance on North Point Street, with an exit via curb cut on Larkin Street. A third curb cut on North Point Street is presently disused. The garage provides 65 spaces of pre-reserved monthly paid parking. 

The project would demolish the existing garage and construct two four-story, 40-foot-tall buildings (with maximum height of 46 feet for roof extensions and appurtenances). The two proposed buildings would be connected at the parking level, which would serve as the base for both buildings. Due to the grade change of the project site, this would be the ground level for the proposed building along North Point Street and a subterranean basement level for the proposed building along Larkin Street. In combination, the two proposed buildings would provide approximately 45,300 gsf of development, including approximately 12,700 square feet (sf) for a semi-subterranean parking garage, approximately 26,000 sf to accommodate 37 dwelling units, and approximately 1,300 sf of ground floor retail space.  The residential unit mix would consist of 13 studios, 13 one-bedrooms, 7 two-bedrooms, and 4 three-bedrooms units. The garage would provide 28 vehicle parking spaces, 57 class 1 bicycle parking spaces, and garbage and recycling collection areas, with vehicle entrance via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut near the western edge of the North Point Street frontage. The project also would provide eight class 2 bicycle parking spaces along North Point Street.  The building along North Point Street would contain a ground floor commercial space and a residential lobby entry for the residential units within the North Point building. A separate residential entry would also be provided for the building along Larkin Street including two units that have direct walk-up access. Each building would have an elevator and stairwell, and direct pedestrian and bicycle access to the shared garage. The project proposes a total of 2,000 sf of common open space including approximately 1,500 sf of common open space on the second level (atop the semi-subterranean garage) that would be shared between the two buildings and would be accessible from both, and an approximately 500 sf common open space deck on the fourth level of the proposed Larkin Street building. Decks, patios, and stoops within various levels of the two buildings would provide a total of about 2,700 sf of private open spaces. Consistent with the Better Roofs Ordinance, solar thermal panels would be provided on the North Point Street building roof.

Construction would require approximately 650 cubic yards of soil excavation. The depth of excavation is proposed at a maximum of 3 to 8 feet below ground surface within a 5,700 sf area. Construction activities would occur over 16 months commencing in March 2020 and are anticipated to be completed in June 2021.",,"1282","1282",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,"1282","1282",,"0",,,"0",,,,"CFAHEY","TEF Design","Andrew Wolfram","415-901-4912",,"2020","Q1","2020_Q1","3 - Northeast","2","Russian Hill","Russian Hill","Fisherman’s Wharf Public Realm Plan; Northeast Waterfront","NC-1","40-X","Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods",,"37.80515198","-122.4223643","POINT (-122.4223643 37.80515198)","98","98","6","6","32"

The project site is occupied by an  existing building that was constructed in 1889. 
The proposal is to demolish the existing two-story, 3,836-square-foot (sf) mixed-use building containing one residential unit and two commercial units and a detached two-car garage, and construct a six-story, mixed use building that would be up to 64.5 feet tall in the front, (73 feet with elevator penthouse) 45 feet tall in the center, and 14 feet tall in the rear on Osage Alley.  

The proposed new building would include eight dwelling units (four one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units) and 1,585 square feet of ground-floor commercial space along Mission Street, eight Class 1 bicycle spaces located on the first floor, and two Class 2 bicycle parking spaces located on the Mission Street sidewalk. 
The proposed project would include 850 square feet of private open space and 665 square feet of public open space. The project eliminates two existing parking spaces and does not propose a basement, or vehicle parking. 
Construction would be estimated to occur over 20 months. Excavation would occur to a depth of two feet over an area of 3,234 square feet amounting to approximately 240 cubic yards. Proposed project would use a mat foundation, as recommended by the geotechnical report.","VERTICAL ADDITION. ONE (E) RESIDENTIAL UNIT IS RENOVATED & 7 NEW RESIDENTIAL UNITS ARE ADDED.

The project would demolish a single-story, 975-square-foot commercial building and 3,000-square-foot surface parking lot and construct a five-story-over-basement, 55-foot-tall, mixed-use residential building including 20 dwelling units and 2,970 square feet of retail space. The project seeks height and bulk exceptions under the HOME SF program beyond standard NC-1 zoning limits.

The proposed building would consist of a basement garage, ground floor retail and residential common open space, and residential uses on floors two through five. The garage would consist of 3,600 square feet of vehicle and bicycle parking accessed via a ramp and curb cut on 45th Avenue. The ground floor would contain 2,325 square feet of retail in the form of two commercial storefronts (one 810 square feet, the other 1,515 square feet), 950 square feet of common open space, and a 195-square-foot residential lobby. A 1,710-square-foot common roof deck is proposed.

The project would contain 20 dwelling units on floors two through five, consisting of 10 one-bedrooms, nine two-bedrooms, and one three-bedroom units. The average size of a one-bedroom unit would be 450 square feet, the average two-bedroom unit would be 700 square feet, and the three-bedroom unit would be 900 square feet. In compliance with the HOME-SF tier 2 requirements, the project would include five (25 percent) on-site affordable dwelling units. The proposed project would include 20 Class 1 bicycle parking spaces in the grade garage. The below grade garage would also provide seven vehicle parking spaces, including one Americans with Disability Act-accessible space.",,"2440","1465",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2440","1465",,,,,,,,,"VBYRD","Leavitt Architecture","Michael Leavitt","415-674-9100",,"2020","Q1","2020_Q1","15 - Outer Sunset","4","Outer Sunset","Sunset/Parkside",,"NC-1","40-X","Sunset Corridors",,"37.7603111","-122.5045723","POINT (-122.5045723 37.7603111)","39","39","10","7","35"

The project site includes lot 1 (5 Joy Street), lot 4 (9 Joy Street), lot 5 (15 Joy Street), and lot 6 (21 Joy Street). The project lots are all located on the south side of Joy Street between Brewster Street and Holladay Avenue. Lots 4, 5, and 6 are only accessible by the existing Joy Street pedestrian stairs. The project sponsor proposes the construction of four single-family residences, one on each lot.  The proposed residences on lots 1, 4, and 6 would be 30 feet tall with two stories over a basement level while the proposed residence on lot 5 would be 30 feet tall with three stories. The proposed buildings would range in size from approximately 1,960 square feet to 2,130 square feet. Off-street parking would only be provided in the building on lot 1 which will contain one parking space accessed from Holladay Avenue. Approximately ten bicycle spaces are proposed. During the approximately 12-month construction period, the proposed project would require excavation of up to 20 feet below ground surface (bgs) and a total of 850 cubic yards of soil disturbance. The proposed foundation for the residential buildings would be drilled reinforced concrete piers that extend approximately 17 feet bgs.","CONSTRUCT (N) 2-STORY SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING","0","0","0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,,"0","0",,,,,,"MCHRISTE",,"HAYWARD DAVID ANTONY",,,"2020","Q1","2020_Q1","11 - Bernal Heights","9","Bernal Heights","Bernal Heights",,"RH-1","40-X","Bayview/Southeast Neighborhoods","Bernal Heights","37.74366405","-122.406909","POINT (-122.406909 37.74366405)","60","60","9","2","2"

All five lots would be merged as part of the project. The proposed project would demolish an existing car wash and gas station, a two-story, three-unit residential building (1052 Oak Street), and a two-story, two-unit residential building (1048-50 Oak Street). The existing two-story, two-unit residential building at 1060-1062 Oak Street constructed in 1900 is a historic resource, and would be relocated 49 feet east of its present location on Oak Street as part of the project. The project would construct a 3- to- 6-story, 40-foot to 65-foot-tall (81 feet at the top of the elevator penthouse), mixed-use building, with 184 residential units above 8,100 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail with frontages on Divisadero and Oak Streets ? see project plans dated April 23, 2019. 

The proposed 150,000 gross square foot building would include 89 studios, 21 one-bedroom, and 74 two-bedroom units. The two existing three-bedroom units within the 1060-1062 Oak Street building would be retained. A total of 15,268 square feet of common open space would be provided in a rear yard, a second floor courtyard, and a roof deck, and 2,403 square feet of private open space in a combination of patios and balconies.  A residential lobby would be located on the ground-floor with access from Oak Street. A ground-floor bicycle storage room would provide 170 Class I bicycle parking spaces. A ground-floor parking garage would provide 56 parking spaces, one car-share space, and a single commercial loading space, with access via a proposed 18-foot curb cut on Oak Street, 150 feet east of the intersection of Oak and Divisadero streets. Seven existing curb cuts would be removed. Fourteen Class II bicycle parking spaces and 14 street trees would be installed in the public right-of-way on the two project frontages. 

A 70-foot-long passenger loading zone (white curb) and a 100-foot-long commercial loading zone (yellow curb) would be requested on Oak and Divisadero streets, respectively. Sidewalk bulbouts would be installed along Divisadero and Oak streets, extending the width of the sidewalks from 10 to 16-feet-wide. 

The relocation of 1060-62 Oak Street would be completed in accordance with plans and details in Page &Turnbull, 1060-62 Oak Street Relocation and Rehabilitation plan set, April 2019 and Bill Brown Construction, 1060/1062 Oak Street Shoring and Move Narrative, undated. In addition to being relocated, additional work proposed for the historic building at 1060-62 Oak Street includes the removal of non-historic rear and side-yard additions; the replacement of non-historic windows with new, historically appropriate windows; the replacement of the front entry doors with new, historically appropriate doors; the replacement of the security gates at the front entries; selective repair and in-kind replacement of siding and ornamental wood features; and interior alterations.

Construction of the proposed project would result in excavation up to 8 feet deep and the removal of about 7,000 cubic yards of soil. According to the geotechnical report, the proposed building is anticipated to use a mat foundation with spread footings on improved soils.

This project requires a General Plan Referral because it requires a Major Encroachment Permit.
 
Eagle Plaza will transform a portion of 12th Street between Harrison and Bernice Streets in Western SoMa, within the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area, into a new public pedestrian-oriented plaza with both greening and LGBTQ/Leather pride commemorative elements. Significant greening is a primary aim of this project, given the dearth of public green space in Western SoMa. In addition to maintaining or replacing all existing trees on site and adding 5 net new trees, Eagle Plaza will create over 3,000 square feet of native, drought-tolerant vegetation where there was none before.
Equally importantly, Eagle Plaza is designed to be a physical commemoration and celebration of the rich LGBTQ and leather cultural history of the surrounding Folsom Gulch neighborhood. Such a space has been called for by the community and the City and, while Eagle Plaza is and always will be a public place welcoming to all ages and demographics, several elements will highlight this important LGBTQ and leather heritage. A central flagpole flying the leather pride flag will build the plaza?s identity, similar to the rainbow pride flag?s role in the Castro. As a playful nod to the area?s history and the Folsom Street Fair, the paving will be dark with inlaid metal ?studs.? In addition, the neighborhood stage area located outside the SF Eagle would be a place for community events featuring local artists, musicians, speakers, and more.

Eagle Plaza will fill important unmet needs in Western SoMa, both for new public green space and for commemoration of Folsom Gulch?s rich LGBTQ heritage. These needs have been identified in multiple City planning documents:

1 Western SoMa Community Plan, Sections 4 and 7.
2 Western SoMa Community Plan, p7.2

Fig & Thistle Apothecary) measuring roughly 500 square feet at the ground level (fronting Ivy Street) In the Hayes Valley neighborhood. The neighborhood is a mixed-use commercial district that contains a limited range of retail commercial activity, which primarily caters to the immediate need of the neighborhood. The few comparison goods that it does provide attract clientele from a wider area outside its neighborhood, mostly the Performing Arts and Civic Center workers and visitors. 

The proposal will involve minor interior tenant improvement and will not expand the existing space. The store-front is currently used as a wine bar (d.b.a. Fig & Thistle) which is also owned by the applicant. The subject building is a three story commercial building located on the corner of Gough and Ivy Streets and is improved with two ground floor commercial store-fronts and medical offices on the second and third floors. No residential units are present. 

The operators have operated their our current business in Hayes Valley for over 6 years and are very active in the neighborhood as a stake-holder participating with the various neighborhood associations. As stake-holders we stay engaged with the community and our neighbors by contributing to the various schools and nonprofits with donations for fundraisers to volunteering our time with the kids at the boys and girls club. We hope to continue our involvement with the community with the dispensary by working on outreach and education to the community about the positive and medicinal uses of cannabis. We are native San Franciscans that have been constantly working to contribute to the betterment of the city by opening business that can hire from the community and build pathways for our workers to grow and move forward.",,"8000","0",,"0","0",,"0","0",,"5000","0",,"0","0",,"3000","0",,"0",,"0","0",,,,"BHICKS","415 Native dba Fig & Thistle Apothe",,"4157067014",,"2020","Q1","2020_Q1","5 - Western Addition","5","Western Addition","Hayes Valley","Market and Octavia; Market and Octavia Living Alleys","NCT-HAYES","50-X","Market Octavia",,"37.77723488","-122.4233149","POINT (-122.4233149 37.77723488)","22","22","4","11","9"
