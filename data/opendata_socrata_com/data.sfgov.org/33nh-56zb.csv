The project would bring the total number of units serving older adults (including skilled nursing and RCFE) units to 584 and resident count to 619. In addition to RCFE and skilled nursing facilities, the Home also plans to make available approximately 45,100 square feet of existing and new facilities to ?The Square?, providing personal services such as a fitness center, medical offices, and recreational facilities, to seniors across the City. Approximately 58 additional parking spaces, for a total 224 parking spaces, 25 Class 1 and 14 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces would be added to the site, to accommodate the additional residents, visitors, staff and Square users. The new buildings front Mission Street and Avalon Avenue, and will provide up to 4,600 square feet of ground floor retail along Mission Street, bringing active uses to the street.  The proposed building along Mission Street is 6 stories, reaching approximately 80-feet.

The proposed project includes alteration, addition, and change of use of an existing three-story, 10,320-square-foot office building at 650 Sacramento Street in the Chinatown neighborhood on a block bounded by Commercial Street to the north, Kearny Street to the west, and Montgomery Street to the east. The proposed project would construct a partial fourth story addition of 1,418 square feet of space (for a total of 11,738 square feet), and include alterations and a change of use to establish 19 group housing rooms. A roof deck would be added on the south side of the building. Interior work for the proposed project would consist of interior demolition of the existing office space, renovation of the building?s lobby, the addition of a shared kitchen on each floor, a laundry room, common space, a bicycle storage room with seven bicycle parking spaces, and the reconfiguration of two sets of stairs and an elevator. There are no existing or proposed off-street vehicle parking spaces at the site and no vehicle spaces are proposed as part of the project. Usable open space, which does not currently exist on the site, would be provided by a 757-square-foot roof deck on the south side of the fourth floor. The project would require excavation of approximately 200 cubic yards of soil, and pilings would extend to a depth of up to 46 feet below grade.

This project requires a General Plan Referral because it requires a Major Encroachment Permit.
 
Eagle Plaza will transform a portion of 12th Street between Harrison and Bernice Streets in Western SoMa, within the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area, into a new public pedestrian-oriented plaza with both greening and LGBTQ/Leather pride commemorative elements. Significant greening is a primary aim of this project, given the dearth of public green space in Western SoMa. In addition to maintaining or replacing all existing trees on site and adding 5 net new trees, Eagle Plaza will create over 3,000 square feet of native, drought-tolerant vegetation where there was none before.
Equally importantly, Eagle Plaza is designed to be a physical commemoration and celebration of the rich LGBTQ and leather cultural history of the surrounding Folsom Gulch neighborhood. Such a space has been called for by the community and the City and, while Eagle Plaza is and always will be a public place welcoming to all ages and demographics, several elements will highlight this important LGBTQ and leather heritage. A central flagpole flying the leather pride flag will build the plaza?s identity, similar to the rainbow pride flag?s role in the Castro. As a playful nod to the area?s history and the Folsom Street Fair, the paving will be dark with inlaid metal ?studs.? In addition, the neighborhood stage area located outside the SF Eagle would be a place for community events featuring local artists, musicians, speakers, and more.

Eagle Plaza will fill important unmet needs in Western SoMa, both for new public green space and for commemoration of Folsom Gulch?s rich LGBTQ heritage. These needs have been identified in multiple City planning documents:

The 4,200-square-foot project site contains a 7,815-square-foot, approximately 25-foot-tall, two-story-over-partial-basement commerical building, constructed in 1928. Proposed project (REVISED 5/11/2018) would add six new stories to the existing building and include interior and exterior alterations. Vertical addition and alterations would result in an approximately 24,458-square-foot, approximately 84-foot-tall (93-foot-tall including elevator/staircase penthouse), eight-story-over-partial-basement, mixed-use building with seven dwelling units and 649 square feet of ground-floor retail. The proposed project would also provide approximately 2,263 square feet of private open space to the residential units in the form of patios and decks at floors two through eight.

A new 10-foot-wide curb cut on Franklin Street would provide access to a ground-floor garage with seven vehicle parking spaces and seven class 1 bicycle parking spaces. The residential and commercial units would be accessed via Franklin Street. Four class 2 bicycle parking spaces would be provided along Franklin Street. Six new street trees would be introduced along Franklin (three trees) and Austin streets (three trees).","CONSTRUCT 8-STORY (N) 7 RESIDENTIAL CONDO OVER COMMERCIAL, WITH 1 BASEMENT.","650","-3550",,,,,,,,"0","-4200",,,,,"650","650",,"0",,,,,,,"MDITO","Reuben, Junius & Rose, LLP",,"4155679000","5 - Western Addition","2","Downtown-Van Ness-Geary","Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods","Western Addition","Western Addition",,"NC-3","130-E",,"37.78858687","-122.4238983","POINT (-122.4238983 37.78858687)","100","100","4","6","39"

The project site slopes up from south to north. In addition, the project site slopes up from east to west. The site is currently occupied by a two-story-over-basement, 50-foot tall building containing an automobile dealership and showroom. The proposed project would renovate the interior of the building and convert the existing automobile dealership and showroom to a health club containing exercise equipment, group fitness rooms and locker room spaces, a lounge, restaurant, and indoor pool on the second floor. In addition, the project proposes to convert a portion of the roof above the proposed swimming pool into a retractable roof. There would be no physical expansion of the existing building envelope. The health club would occupy approximately 39,940 square feet in the basement, ground, and second floors. 

Approximately 1,500 square feet of the basement level would be retained as a loading dock; the remainder of the basement would be converted to health club use. The project would reduce the total number of vehicular parking spaces on-site from 19 to 0, allowing only for bicycle parking and storage. The proposed project would comply with bicycle parking requirements. 

The project would excavate no more than 49 cubic yards of soil to a maximum depth of 2?0? below ground for foundation work. Construction activities primarily consist of interior work for new partitions, a new pool and jacuzzi area, restroom and locker areas, restaurant fit-out, and interior finishes. Some rooftop work, including construction of the retractable roof and installation of new HVAC equipment, would also be required.
