We expect the next Program Cycle to begin by November 2022. Application links will go live when the cycle opens. The Traffic Calming Program does consider impacts to Muni service when designing traffic calming devices, but being located on a transit route does not automatically disqualify your block. This may have changed since you last attempted to apply.
Please do not hesitate to reach out to the Traffic Calming Program with any other questions.

This is in response to your June 27, 2022, 311 request 15502815.  Thank you for sharing your concerns and for inquiring about traffic calming on 42nd Avenue between Wawona Street and Sloat Boulevard.  The SFMTA is committed to making our streets more comfortable and our neighborhoods more livable for all roadway users.  To this end, it sounds like our application-based residential traffic calming program may be appropriate to address your concerns.
We are currently accepting applications for the FY22-23 Residential Traffic Calming Program cycle. The application window closes June 30, 2022.  The application form and instructions can be found on our Residential Traffic Calming Program website at: 
https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/walk/residential-traffic-calming-program.  
The website also contains lots of useful information about traffic calming as well as an FAQ section you may find helpful.
Please note that in order to complete the application, we typically require signatures from twenty (20) households on your block to demonstrate local support.  If there are fewer than 40 households on your block, signatures are required from half of them.  Please also note that if you are applying for traffic calming on multiple blocks, you will need to submit a separate application with the appropriate signatures for each block.
If you have further questions about the application process, please feel free to contact us at TrafficCalmingApp@sfmta.com.",SFMTA - Livable Streets Queue,Street Defects,Pavement_Defect,Pavement_Defect,"2718 42ND AVE, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, 94116",42ND AVE,4,Parkside,TARAVAL,37.7359827,-122.4997458,"(37.7359827, -122.4997458)",Web,
