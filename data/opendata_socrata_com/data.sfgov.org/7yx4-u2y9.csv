The project site is occupied by a 27-foot-tall, two-story over basement, industrial building that is approximately 13,710 gross square feet in size with 12 below-grade parking spaces. The existing automobile repair garage building was constructed in circa 1914 and is currently vacant (formerly occupied by ?Green Street Auto Body?). 

The project sponsor proposes a two-story vertical addition and a change of use to convert the existing automotive garage to a new residential development with five residential units. The project would add approximately 13,408 gross square feet to the existing building. The project includes 1,369 square feet of common open space in the form of a roof deck, and 2,265 square feet of private open space via balconies and terraces. The project includes alterations to the front facade, including the restoration of two pilasters that were removed from the central arch to allow for a wider garage opening during a 1933 alteration. With the proposed improvements, the building would be 40 feet tall (53 feet tall with elevator penthouse) and 27,118 gross square feet in size with 10 below-grade parking spaces and five class 1 bicycle parking spaces. In addition, the project includes the expansion of the existing basement by 1,615 square feet (from 5,516 square feet to 7,131 square feet). Project construction would require up to approximately 15 feet of excavation below ground surface, resulting in approximately 1,400 cubic yards of soil disturbance. Conventional hand-excavated end-bearing piers would be used for the proposed underpinning system. Heavy equipment would not be used within 10 horizontal feet from adjacent shallow foundations and basement walls; jumping jack or hand-operated vibratory plate compactors would be used for compacting fill within this zone. The project site is listed as an active leaking underground storage tank cleanup site on the Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites List (also known as the ?Cortese List?).","PROPOSAL IS TO MAINTAIN (E) GARAGE WALLS & CONSTRUCT (5) (N) RESIGENTIAL UNITS WITHIN (E) STRUCTURE & IN A TWO-STORY VERTICAL ADDITION.

The site is also located within the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District. The existing seven-story, 242,730-square-foot (sf) building, constructed in 1974, consists of approximately 163,000 sf of retail use and 54,000 sf of accessory office use. The proposed project would convert the existing single-tenant building into a multi-tenant building consisting of retail, restaurant, and office uses. Floors 1-3 and the basement level would continue as retail use, but would be reconfigured to provide multiple tenant spaces with storefronts and public access along Stockton and O'Farrell Streets. Existing retail use would also be reconfigured on floors 4-6 to provide for multiple tenants. The project would include a change of use of 49,999 sf of retail use into office use on floors 6-7. A new roof top addition of approximately 10,800 sf is proposed for restaurant use. It would increase the building's total height from about 104 feet to 120 feet. The gross square footage for the proposed reconfigured building would be approximately 246,800 sf.

Proposed streetscape improvements include three new street lights, one existing relocated streetlight, and about 10 new street trees. All improvements would be coordinated with the SFMTA's Central Subway project plans. There is no existing or proposed off-street vehicle parking, but the project would request the SFMTA to install 28 class 2 on-street bicycle parking spaces in dual bike racks on Stockton and O'Farrell Streets, and would also install 30 class 1 bicycle spaces in the basement level. The existing uses are served by a loading dock containing three loading bays accessed from the narrow Security Pacific Place. This loading dock would be reconfigured for two loading bays and one service bay.

The project would require excavation of approximately 4,300 cubic yards of soil for structural upgrades to the building that would include perimeter tie beams, shear wall, and a sewage ejector and grease interceptor. The depth of excavation would extend to 12 feet below the existing basement. No particularly noisy equipment or impact equipment/devices would be required for construction of the proposed improvements. Construction activities would include demolition, site preparation, grading, interior and exterior upgrades to be completed in overlapping phases commencing in March 2019 and anticipated to be completed in May 2021.",,"206840","-10141",,,"0",,,"0",,"49999","-3890",,,"0",,"156841","-6251",,"0",,,"0",,,,"ETUFFY","Reuben, Junius & Rose, LLP","Tuija Catalano","4155679000","4 - Downtown","3","Financial District","Financial District/South Beach","Downtown Streetscape Plan; Downtown","C-3-R","80-130-F","Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA",,"37.78697967","-122.4059534","2019","Q3","2019_Q3","POINT (-122.4059534 37.78697967)","19","19","6","3","8"

The project site includes lot 1 (5 Joy Street), lot 4 (9 Joy Street), lot 5 (15 Joy Street), and lot 6 (21 Joy Street). The project lots are all located on the south side of Joy Street between Brewster Street and Holladay Avenue. Lots 4, 5, and 6 are only accessible by the existing Joy Street pedestrian stairs. The project sponsor proposes the construction of four single-family residences, one on each lot.  The proposed residences on lots 1, 4, and 6 would be 30 feet tall with two stories over a basement level while the proposed residence on lot 5 would be 30 feet tall with three stories. The proposed buildings would range in size from approximately 1,960 square feet to 2,130 square feet. Off-street parking would only be provided in the building on lot 1 which will contain one parking space accessed from Holladay Avenue. Approximately ten bicycle spaces are proposed. During the approximately 12-month construction period, the proposed project would require excavation of up to 20 feet below ground surface (bgs) and a total of 850 cubic yards of soil disturbance. The proposed foundation for the residential buildings would be drilled reinforced concrete piers that extend approximately 17 feet bgs.","CONSTRUCT (N) 2-STORY SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING","0","0","0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,,"0","0",,,,,,"MCHRISTE",,"HAYWARD DAVID ANTONY",,"11 - Bernal Heights","9","Bernal Heights","Bernal Heights",,"RH-1","40-X","Bayview/Southeast Neighborhoods PDA","Bernal Heights","37.74363396","-122.4068175","2019","Q3","2019_Q3","POINT (-122.4068175 37.74363396)","60","60","9","2","2"

The project would construct a 5-story building plus 1 basement level, to accommodate a new Buddhist education and community center. It will include a light-filled courtyard adjacent to an art gallery, tea house, and book store for public use. A Buddhist shrine and a meditation room serve as the main congregation spaces, accommodating a group of about 220 occupants during weekly ceremonies. An education center consisting of four classrooms and an auditorium will host community classes for children and adults. In support of these community-oriented spaces are three levels of private dormatories for monastics and visiting volunteers from the Bay Area and around the world.

The project site is located on a roughly triangular-shaped block bounded by Hudson Avenue to the northeast, Newhall Street to the southeast, and Innes Avenue to the southwest.

The proposed project would demolish the existing vacant lot, remove an existing general advertising sign, and construct an approximately 36,130-square-foot, 60-foot-tall, five-story mixed-use residential building. The building would include 32 dwelling units and approximately 3,780 square feet of ground-floor and mezzanine-level single retail space fronting Third Street. The residential portion of the building would consist of 15 one-bedroom units, 15 two-bedroom units, and two three-bedroom units. The five-story mixed-use building would provide approximately 8,020 square feet of common space. Open space would be provided through a common roof garden and a private deck for one residence. The approximately 1,740-square-foot ground-floor garage would provide space for 11 cars utilizing three, three-tier parking stackers (eight standard vehicle parking spaces, one Americans with Disabilities [ADA]-accessible space, and two car share spaces). The garage would be accessed via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut on Hudson Avenue. Thirty-two Class 1 bicycle parking spaces would be provided in a ground floor bicycle room, accessible via Newhall Street or through the residential lobby fronting Third Street. Ten Class 2 bicycle parking spaces would be provided adjacent to the project site on the surrounding sidewalks.

The proposed project would include excavation of approximately 300 cubic yards of material to a maximum depth of 8 feet below grade. The proposed foundation for the  building would be  drilled piers extending at least 10 feet below-grade and into bedrock. The proposed project would retain all of the existing street trees on the project site and would provide an additional seven street trees on Newhall Street, five street trees on Hudson Avenue, and two street trees on Third Street. A bulbout and parklet are proposed on the southeastern portion of the block, to increase the sidewalk width along Newhall Street.",,"0","0","0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,,"0","0",,,,,,,,,,"10 - South Bayshore","10","Bayview","Bayview Hunters Point","Bayview Hunters Point","M-1","40-X","Bayview/Southeast Neighborhoods PDA","Third Street; 3rd St Alcohol Restrict; Fringe Financial Services RUD","37.73989446","-122.3886489","2019","Q3","2019_Q3","POINT (-122.3886489 37.73989446)","86","86","2","9","1"

The project site includes lot 1 (5 Joy Street), lot 4 (9 Joy Street), lot 5 (15 Joy Street), and lot 6 (21 Joy Street). The project lots are all located on the south side of Joy Street between Brewster Street and Holladay Avenue. Lots 4, 5, and 6 are only accessible by the existing Joy Street pedestrian stairs. The project sponsor proposes the construction of four single-family residences, one on each lot.  The proposed residences on lots 1, 4, and 6 would be 30 feet tall with two stories over a basement level while the proposed residence on lot 5 would be 30 feet tall with three stories. The proposed buildings would range in size from approximately 1,960 square feet to 2,130 square feet. Off-street parking would only be provided in the building on lot 1 which will contain one parking space accessed from Holladay Avenue. Approximately ten bicycle spaces are proposed. During the approximately 12-month construction period, the proposed project would require excavation of up to 20 feet below ground surface (bgs) and a total of 850 cubic yards of soil disturbance. The proposed foundation for the residential buildings would be drilled reinforced concrete piers that extend approximately 17 feet bgs.","CONSTRUCT (N) 2-STORY SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING","0","0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"MCHRISTE",,"HAYWARD DAVID ANTONY",,"11 - Bernal Heights","9","Bernal Heights","Bernal Heights",,"RH-1","40-X","Bayview/Southeast Neighborhoods PDA","Bernal Heights","37.74363396","-122.4068175","2019","Q3","2019_Q3","POINT (-122.4068175 37.74363396)","60","60","9","2","2"

The lot is L-shaped, with approximately 92 feet of frontage along North Point Street and approximately 46 feet of frontage along Larkin Street. There are three lots at the corner of Larkin Street and North Point Street that separate the two frontages. The site is moderately upsloping along Larkin Street, moving south from North Point Street to Bay Street. The project site is within a NC-1, Neighborhood Commercial Cluster District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

An approximately 29,400-square foot parking garage, constructed in 1925, currently occupies the project site. The garage frontage is two-stories tall on North Point Street. Along Larkin Street, the lower floor of the garage is semi-subterranean, such that the frontage is one story tall. Access to the garage is provided via a curb cut and vehicular entrance on North Point Street, with an exit via curb cut on Larkin Street. A third curb cut on North Point Street is presently disused. The garage provides 65 spaces of pre-reserved monthly paid parking. 

The project would demolish the existing garage and construct two four-story, 40-foot-tall buildings (with maximum height of 46 feet for roof extensions and appurtenances). The two proposed buildings would be connected at the parking level, which would serve as the base for both buildings. Due to the grade change of the project site, this would be the ground level for the proposed building along North Point Street and a subterranean basement level for the proposed building along Larkin Street. In combination, the two proposed buildings would provide approximately 45,300 gsf of development, including approximately 12,700 square feet (sf) for a semi-subterranean parking garage, approximately 26,000 sf to accommodate 37 dwelling units, and approximately 1,300 sf of ground floor retail space.  The residential unit mix would consist of 13 studios, 13 one-bedrooms, 7 two-bedrooms, and 4 three-bedrooms units. The garage would provide 28 vehicle parking spaces, 57 class 1 bicycle parking spaces, and garbage and recycling collection areas, with vehicle entrance via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut near the western edge of the North Point Street frontage. The project also would provide eight class 2 bicycle parking spaces along North Point Street.  The building along North Point Street would contain a ground floor commercial space and a residential lobby entry for the residential units within the North Point building. A separate residential entry would also be provided for the building along Larkin Street including two units that have direct walk-up access. Each building would have an elevator and stairwell, and direct pedestrian and bicycle access to the shared garage. The project proposes a total of 2,000 sf of common open space including approximately 1,500 sf of common open space on the second level (atop the semi-subterranean garage) that would be shared between the two buildings and would be accessible from both, and an approximately 500 sf common open space deck on the fourth level of the proposed Larkin Street building. Decks, patios, and stoops within various levels of the two buildings would provide a total of about 2,700 sf of private open spaces. Consistent with the Better Roofs Ordinance, solar thermal panels would be provided on the North Point Street building roof.

Construction would require approximately 650 cubic yards of soil excavation. The depth of excavation is proposed at a maximum of 3 to 8 feet below ground surface within a 5,700 sf area. Construction activities would occur over 16 months commencing in March 2020 and are anticipated to be completed in June 2021.",,"1282","1282",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,,"0",,"1282","1282",,"0",,,"0",,,,"VBYRD","TEF Design","Andrew Wolfram","415-901-4912","3 - Northeast","2","Russian Hill","Russian Hill","Fisherman’s Wharf Public Realm Plan; Northeast Waterfront","NC-1","40-X","Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA",,"37.80514703","-122.422351","2019","Q3","2019_Q3","POINT (-122.422351 37.80514703)","98","98","6","6","32"

All five lots would be merged as part of the project. The proposed project would demolish an existing car wash and gas station, a two-story, three-unit residential building (1052 Oak Street), and a two-story, two-unit residential building (1048-50 Oak Street). The existing two-story, two-unit residential building at 1060-1062 Oak Street constructed in 1900 is a historic resource, and would be relocated 49 feet east of its present location on Oak Street as part of the project. The project would construct a 3- to- 6-story, 40-foot to 65-foot-tall (81 feet at the top of the elevator penthouse), mixed-use building, with 184 residential units above 8,100 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail with frontages on Divisadero and Oak Streets ? see project plans dated April 23, 2019. 

The proposed 150,000 gross square foot building would include 89 studios, 21 one-bedroom, and 74 two-bedroom units. The two existing three-bedroom units within the 1060-1062 Oak Street building would be retained. A total of 15,268 square feet of common open space would be provided in a rear yard, a second floor courtyard, and a roof deck, and 2,403 square feet of private open space in a combination of patios and balconies.  A residential lobby would be located on the ground-floor with access from Oak Street. A ground-floor bicycle storage room would provide 170 Class I bicycle parking spaces. A ground-floor parking garage would provide 56 parking spaces, one car-share space, and a single commercial loading space, with access via a proposed 18-foot curb cut on Oak Street, 150 feet east of the intersection of Oak and Divisadero streets. Seven existing curb cuts would be removed. Fourteen Class II bicycle parking spaces and 14 street trees would be installed in the public right-of-way on the two project frontages. 

A 70-foot-long passenger loading zone (white curb) and a 100-foot-long commercial loading zone (yellow curb) would be requested on Oak and Divisadero streets, respectively. Sidewalk bulbouts would be installed along Divisadero and Oak streets, extending the width of the sidewalks from 10 to 16-feet-wide. 

The relocation of 1060-62 Oak Street would be completed in accordance with plans and details in Page &Turnbull, 1060-62 Oak Street Relocation and Rehabilitation plan set, April 2019 and Bill Brown Construction, 1060/1062 Oak Street Shoring and Move Narrative, undated. In addition to being relocated, additional work proposed for the historic building at 1060-62 Oak Street includes the removal of non-historic rear and side-yard additions; the replacement of non-historic windows with new, historically appropriate windows; the replacement of the front entry doors with new, historically appropriate doors; the replacement of the security gates at the front entries; selective repair and in-kind replacement of siding and ornamental wood features; and interior alterations.

Construction of the proposed project would result in excavation up to 8 feet deep and the removal of about 7,000 cubic yards of soil.

The project site slopes up from south to north. In addition, the project site slopes up from east to west. The site is currently occupied by a two-story-over-basement, 50-foot tall building containing an automobile dealership and showroom. The proposed project would renovate the interior of the building and convert the existing automobile dealership and showroom to a health club containing exercise equipment, group fitness rooms and locker room spaces, a lounge, restaurant, and indoor pool on the second floor. In addition, the project proposes to convert a portion of the roof above the proposed swimming pool into a retractable roof. There would be no physical expansion of the existing building envelope. The health club would occupy approximately 39,940 square feet in the basement, ground, and second floors. 

Approximately 1,500 square feet of the basement level would be retained as a loading dock; the remainder of the basement would be converted to health club use. The project would reduce the total number of vehicular parking spaces on-site from 19 to 0, allowing only for bicycle parking and storage. The proposed project would comply with bicycle parking requirements. 

The project would excavate no more than 49 cubic yards of soil to a maximum depth of 2?0? below ground for foundation work. Construction activities primarily consist of interior work for new partitions, a new pool and jacuzzi area, restroom and locker areas, restaurant fit-out, and interior finishes. Some rooftop work, including construction of the retractable roof and installation of new HVAC equipment, would also be required. Project construction is anticipated to last approximately eight months.",,"30310","-3690",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"30310","-3690",,,,,,,,,"MDITO","Gruen Associates",,"3239374270","5 - Western Addition","5","Downtown/Civic Center","Western Addition","Van Ness Corridor","RC-4","130-V","Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA","Van Ness; Van Ness Automotive","37.78258457","-122.4211935","2019","Q3","2019_Q3","POINT (-122.4211935 37.78258457)","100","100","4","11","39"
