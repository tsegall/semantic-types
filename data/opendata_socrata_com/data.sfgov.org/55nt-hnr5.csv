One parcel, located at 825 Van Ness Avenue, comprises an existing six story commercial building.  The second parcel, located at 830 Eddy Street, includes a two level parking structure with 62 legally nonconforming parking spaces accessory to the commercial building at 825 Van Ness.  The Project proposes to retain the existing legally non-conforming commercial building at 825 Van Ness and retain and reconfigure 40 of the 62 legally nonconforming accessory parking spaces and construct a new 14-story, 120-unit residential building at 830 Eddy, with primary pedestrian and lobby access provided from Willow Street.  The new building at 830 Eddy will provide a total of 100 underground parking spaces, of which 40 spaces will remain dedicated to the existing commercial building at 825 Van Ness, with 60 spaces dedicated to the new residential units, at the principally permitted ratio of 0.5 spaces per residential unit.

The PPA was submitted on 7/15/15 and the 90 day deadline is 10/13/15.","ERECT A 12 STORIES, 126 RESIDENTIAL UNITS, 2 BASEMENTS, TYPE 1A BUILDING.","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","29810","0","0","0","0","0","4940","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","VBYRD","Build Inc.",,"4155517626","5 - Western Addition","5","Downtown-Van Ness-Geary","Western Addition","Downtown/Civic Center","2019","Q1","2019_Q1","37.7830519","-122.4216464","POINT (-122.4216464 37.7830519)","100","4","11","39"
