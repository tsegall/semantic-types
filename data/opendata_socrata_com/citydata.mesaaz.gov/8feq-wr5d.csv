To see a map of downtown Mesa boundaries see the ""Source Link"" below. Revenues are grouped by Reporting Period Year and Reporting Period Month. Reporting period generally refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was received/posted by the City. As taxpayers make payments and other corrections to previous periods, over time monthly revenue numbers fluctuate.

This dataset contains sales tax revenue for taxpayers within the City of Mesa by reporting month. Reporting month refers to the time period when the consumer activity took place and is a representation of economic activity in the city. For example, a sale registered in the month of March, appears in the reporting month March, regardless of when the payment was actually received/posted by the City. Revenues by reporting month change as audits, collections and other taxpayer payments/refunds are processed or other corrections to previous periods are received. These updates to revenues are reported to the month for which the taxable activity occurred. For these reasons, generally speaking, reporting month revenues become a more accurate reflection of consumer activity over time. For sales tax revenues reflecting posting month (accounting period when the tax revenues were posted), see ""Citywide Tax Revenue by Post Month"" at https://data.mesaaz.gov/Financials/Citywide-Tax-Revenue-by-Post-Month/e9zg-r4w9.

Census money income is defined as income received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. 
Therefore, money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits, such as food stamps, health benefits, subsidized housing, and goods produced and consumed on the farm. In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. 

Data users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income. 
Census also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity.

"46","Economic Development","Annual Income - Median and Per Capita","The Annual Income - Median and Per Capita dataset shows Median Household Income and Per Capita Income for the City of Mesa, and some comparative numbers from other neighboring communities as well as Maricopa County.
Census money income is defined as income received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. 
Therefore, money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits, such as food stamps, health benefits, subsidized housing, and goods produced and consumed on the farm. In addition, money income does not reflect the fact that noncash benefits are also received by some nonfarm residents which may take the form of the use of business transportation and facilities, full or partial payments by business for retirement programs, medical and educational expenses, etc. 

Data users should consider these elements when comparing income levels. Moreover, users should be aware that for many different reasons there is a tendency in household surveys for respondents to underreport their income. Based on an analysis of independently derived income estimates, the Census Bureau determined that respondents report income earned from wages or salaries much better than other sources of income and that the reported wage and salary income is nearly equal to independent estimates of aggregate income. 
Census also derives alternative income measures that systematically remove or add various income components such as deducting payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes and including the value of specific noncash benefits, food stamps, school lunches, housing subsidies, health insurance programs, and return on home equity. 
These alternative measures are derived from information collected in Census surveys along with information from other agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Bureau of ...","Public","2018-03-21T13:31:00.000","published","vagb-mau5","https://data.mesaaz.gov/d/vagb-mau5","data.mesaaz.gov","Neighborhoods","xEconomicDevelopmentData@MesaAZ.gov",,"yearly",

The average charges for the current fiscal year for various cities are compared with the average costs for the current fiscal year in the City of
Mesa. While some neighboring municipalities have a different resource mix than Mesa, bringing them all together allows for comparison to ensure that Mesa remains an affordable place to live, work and play. Sources include applicable Tax Year Limited Property Value, Maricopa County Assessor's Office, and Maricopa County Tax Levy and Rates page. 
The Average Homeowner’s Annual Cost Comparison Notes:
• The City of Mesa and the Town of Gilbert are the only municipalities that do not have a primary
property tax. All other revenue sources exist in all municipalities.
• Estimated city sales taxes paid is based on average household expenditures from the Bureau of Labor
and Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey applied to each city’s sales tax rate. Some cities have
different rates for different taxable items. Mesa does not collect sales tax on the sale of food for
consumption at home.
• Comparisons are determined using a standard service level for all cities.
• Standard solid waste charges are for twice per week garbage (and recyclables where applicable)
collection using 90 gallon barrels. Solid Waste residential charges include a Green and Clean fee for
Mesa.
• Other city’s environmental fees are included as applicable.
• Charges are based on FY 16/17 annual average usage of 8,900 water gallons per month, ranging from
6,000 in winter to 12,000 in summer.
• Wastewater charges are based on the average consumption of water during the winter months.

For a regional view of both bus service and light rail ridership, please go to their website, under their Publications/Reports section. Valley Metro tracks bus riders as they board. Bus service expands the scope and range of light rail, in addition to being a geographically more flexible means of public transportation in comparison to light rail.
