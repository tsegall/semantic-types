We would like to hold these events all year round, rather than only nine months of the year per our current permit. 

Setup for the event begins around 3pm with the arrival of some of the food trucks that take longer to prepare their food. As the food trucks prepare in our parking lot, our own staff sets up 12 round tables with 8 chairs around each table. They also set up trash cans, conveniently positioned for easy clean up by our patrons.

The event officially starts at 5:30pm, though if people arrive early (at 5 as the get off work), our food truck vendors will likely not turn them away. Food will be served until 8pm. Around that time, as the crowd peters out, clean up begins. Tables and chairs are broken down, trash is moved to the dumpster, and everything is returned to their storage places in the church. That takes about 30 minutes. Everything should be done by 8:30pm. An adjustment would be made to the time during the hotter months (June-August). During those months, our event will start at 6:30pm and end at 9:00pm. 

During the event, the church facilities will be open to the public. A handicap accessible bathroom is available in our chapel and additional facilities are located in the church. Pending need – or other church events that may be happening concurrently – a portable restroom may also be reserved for the Food Truck Friday event. 

In terms of advertisement for the event, a large portable vinyl banner (36” by 72”) is hung on the overhang in front of our church the Sunday prior and additional vinyl banners are placed at the southeast and southwest corners of our property. All other promotions take place in our parish bulletin and on our website.","Distribution","Distributed","2019-05-06T00:00:00.000",,"2018-04-16T00:00:00.000","1","1","1","1730 W GUADALUPE RD","1730","W","GUADALUPE","RD","1730 W GUADALUPE RD MESA","33.364404","-111.870895","POINT (-111.870895 33.364404)"

The parcel is already zoned limited commercial which allows this type of storage.

We have uploaded a complete design package that includes a satellite view of the bare lot, case studies of the proposed building material, 3D renderings looking Southeast & Northeast, Materials / Lighting, and a detailed site plan showing the overall project, floorplan, and landscape design.  Our intent is that this will be a very attractive development, and may spur interest in improving surrounding properties.

This is a relatively small parcel (160’ by 60’) that meets the criteria of the Development Incentive Permit (DIP).  If qualifies for the DIP because:
-	AREA: The total area of the parcel does not exceed 2.5 net acres & has been in its current configuration for more than 10 years.
-	UTILITIES: The parcel has direct access to utilities
-	SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT: Within a 1,200 foot radius the total developable land is not more than 25% vacant.  Currently it is approximately 7% vacant (see attached satellite view showing the 1,200 ft radius).  In addition, all surrounding lots and parcels were developed in the 1950’s, 60’s, 70’s or 80’s.

The DIP incentives we would like to be granted are modifications to setbacks & onsite parking.  We propose that the setbacks be 5 feet on all sides.  Additionally, we propose no onsite parking spaces. 

Due to the limited size of the parcel, standard setback requirements would make any type of development very difficult. Adjusting the setback requirement to 5 feet on all sides would allow for enough usable space to develop the property.
We have requested a Special Use Permit to eliminate the requirement of parking spaces on our property. Standard parking requirements for Mini-storage (which would be the closest category we could find) would be 4 parking spaces. The main purpose of these parking spaces is to allow for the parking of visitors that would be coming into a sales office to inquire about the availability of units and purchase storage options. Our property, however, would not have a sales office (all leasing would be done online) and visitors would only be on site if accompanied by one of the owners to inspect a vacant space. In this case the visitor would park on our property directly in front of the unit they would be interested in renting – there would be no reason for them to park along the street. Any tenant of a unit on our property would not park a vehicle anywhere on the property other than directly in front of the door of their unit. 
Upon reading the purposes of Chapter 32 of the Mesa Zoning Ordinance: ‘On-Site Parking, Loading, and Circulation’ – we feel that the absence of the 4 parking spaces on our property would not pose any risk of prohibiting ‘efficient movement of vehicular traffic’ on the property itself or in the streets adjacent to our property. Nor would it present a risk of conflict between pedestrian and vehicular circulation. There is no unpaved area on our property that would be used for vehicle parking or movement – therefore dust production would not be a problem. The use of our property will be adequately served with no dedicated on-site parking spaces. There will be no parking demand generated by our property and there will therefore be ‘no detrimental impact on the supply of on-street parking in the surrounding area.’
The landscape design will improve the appearance of the community using native or adapted plant species.  The landscaping will be watered by an automatic drip system and will be maintained appropriately as needed.

Our goal is that this project will be an attractive addition to the City of Mesa and we are confident it will enrich the surrounding area.  We look forward to doing our part to bring this project to fruition.","Distribution","Distributed","2019-06-17T00:00:00.000","Michael Gildenstern","2018-09-24T00:00:00.000","-6","1","1",,,,,,,,,

Kitty Pause Kitty Café will function as a combination facility – a cat lounge and a coffee house. The cat lounge side is completely separated from the coffee house side by a roof to floor wall. The upper portion of the wall below the ceiling tiles will be safety glass so that patrons can view the cats from the coffee house side. There will be a double entry door between the coffee house and the cat lounge side of the house to assure that no cats or cat dander can enter the coffee house side.  There are two separate air conditioners with separate air intakes and air output vents – one for each side of the house as per Environmental Health Services requirements.  Cats and cat-care related service providers enter and exist through the back-exit door to the cat lounge.
The cat lounge is a feline activity center where patrons will visit with adoptable cats.  A variety of planned activities, such as Yoga with cats and board games with cats, will take place in the cat lounge in addition to unstructured play time with the cats.  The coffee house side of the facility will offer coffees, teas, sweet and savory pastries, cookies, and other sweet treats to customers.  There will be a small boutique area in the coffee house that will feature cat-inspired collectible items for sale.","Distribution","Distributed","2020-09-10T00:00:00.000","Heather Omta","2020-07-07T00:00:00.000","-13","1","1","1837 W GUADALUPE RD","1837","W","GUADALUPE","RD","1837 W GUADALUPE RD 107 MESA","33.362845","-111.87368","POINT (-111.87368 33.362845)"

La Semilla Christian Learning Center is a Christian-based organization focusing on child care for ages 1-5. Located at 3050 S Country Club Dr., Suite 23 & 24., the daycare will function within Upon this Rock Christian Church. There will be no architectural changes to the building, and we intend to acquire a special use permit to allow for the daycare to run in conjunction with a place of worship.  

For the Special Use Permit, issued by the Board of Adjustment we propose that this project will advance the goals, objectives and are consistent with the policies of the General Plan and any other applicable City plan or policy. We believe our location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed project are consistent with the purposes of the district, where it is located, and follow the General Plan with any other applicable City plan or policy. This proposed project will not be injurious or detrimental to the adjacent or surrounding properties in the area, nor will the proposed project or improvements be injurious or detrimental to the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City. Adequate public services, public facilities and public infrastructure are available to serve the proposed project. 

Operation Plan:

Days of Operation are Monday thru Friday from 7:00am to 5:30pm. Including myself, there are four staff members. Two of the daycare workers are part-time, and the other two are full-time. The daycare will accept ages 1-5 into the program. Currently we have one class, but will begin to breakout the classrooms by age once we exceed 5 children. 

The indoor play area is currently 357 sq ft, but will be moved to the sanctuary space once we have more than 7 children in attendance. The sanctuary is 1732 sq ft which can accommodate a maximum of 34 children. The maximum number of children we will hold in this facility is 30. 

For the drop-off of a child the parents ring the doorbell, we unlock the door, and use the Procare Connect application for check-in. Once the parent exits, we lock the door behind them. 
For pick-up of the child the parents ring the doorbell and are walked to the classroom to pick-up their child. The daycare or parent have the ability to sign-out the child via the Procare application. Also, we only allow parents and pre-approved friends and family to pick-up their child, no exceptions. 

Spaces in the parking lot are not limited, with easy access north and west of the entrance. Currently, there are no designated parking spaces, if designated parking spaces are required we will reach out to the management company to arrange it. 

The surrounding businesses are varied, but currently, the two suites west of us are vacant, and north of us is a Storage West Call Center. Other businesses include a dentist’s office, lawn mower engine and supply, furniture store, trophy shop and pest control company. It is a quite plaza, will little activity and a lot of available parking. 

We look forward to reaching out to our community and providing child care services to parents, and providing the children with a Christian foundation.","Distribution","Distributed","2021-01-12T00:00:00.000","Rebecca Gorton","2018-12-05T00:00:00.000","-13","1","1","3050 S COUNTRY CLUB DR","3050","S","COUNTRY CLUB","DR","3050 S COUNTRY CLUB DR 24 MESA","33.359363","-111.842142","POINT (-111.842142 33.359363)"
