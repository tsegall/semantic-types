"Mind and Body","CTK20760","Mind and Body","Thich Nhat Hanh’s Plum Village community defines mindfulness as a state of mind “we generate when we bring our mind back to our body and get in touch with what is going on in the present moment, within us and around us. We become aware of our breathing and come home to our body, fully present for ourselves and whatever we are doing.” Mindfulness allows us to slow down and take in each moment of our day in this fast-paced and ever changing world. In this weekly mediation class with Aaron Roth, we will practice sitting mindfulness meditation (focusing using our breath), bell meditation, and also walking meditation. Instruction and guidance will be provided.  This practice is good for all levels of meditation experience.

NO CLASS NOV 11

NOTE: A meditation cushion or chair is highly recommended for this practice.

"Mind and Body","CTK20760","Mind and Body","So many of the things we do in our daily lives add tension and stress. One of the ways of thinking about meditation is that it is an undoing and a return to an inner peacefulness that we have lost touch with in our busy, stressful lives. In this 6 week course with Michelle Johnston you will learn the foundations of mindfulness practice: body, breath, emotions and mind. You will begin to use these tools of meditation to access inner peacefulness. Please bring a yoga mat and a blanket.
