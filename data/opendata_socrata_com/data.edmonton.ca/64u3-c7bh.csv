It features twelve artists of Asian heritage whose works engage with intersecting narratives, communities, and discursive contexts that navigate the complexities of “Asian-ness” and Asian identities.Some of these artists explore how specific objects and places can become infused with culturally specific meanings that bridge different generations and contribute to a sense of shared heritage. Other artists reveal how intangible things such as language, music, and memories can embody a collective experience or legacy, providing an anchor for redefining or reimagining what it means to belong to a specific community. Some works reshape understandings of “Asian-ness” that have become associated with specific objects and places. The creation of the works themselves becomes a means to make “Asian-ness” visible and to expose its absence in contexts that have rendered “Asian-ness” invisible.This exhibition’s works demonstrate the persistence and resilience of Asian experiences that should be considered, in their own right, as meaningful and valuable for the people who belong to those communities.Enjoy this online multimedia exhibit from June 25th to August 7th!This exhibition is funded with support from the Edmonton Arts Council and the City of Edmonton.Get social with us!Instagram: @artistryprojectsTwitter: @artisteprojectsFacebook: @intersectionsinart",

About basinInspired by the French word ""bassin"", which can be used to mean both ""sink"" and ""pelvis"", the piece delves into how the pelvis can move, and the imagery, connotations, and taboos associated with this part of the body. The original score includes field recordings created by sound designer Raylene Campbell using an old metal basin, which are integrated into the sound design. basin aims to shake up some of the stereotypes associated with a female body and tries to ask questions like ""what can this body do/not do, and why/why not?""About ESPARTANÆESPARTANÆ, can be translated as ""spartans"". The dance presents the plurality (or kinds of) strength the character, Esparta, can feel and express. When the piece was conceived, ""I was inspired by feminine thinking (Vanessa Rosales, Miriam Toews, Bell Hooks) to challenge the capacities of my own body and discover what physical strength looked like in my body. How is strength distributed in my body? What makes me feel strong?"", says Andrea.",

About basinInspired by the French word ""bassin"", which can be used to mean both ""sink"" and ""pelvis"", the piece delves into how the pelvis can move, and the imagery, connotations, and taboos associated with this part of the body. The original score includes field recordings created by sound designer Raylene Campbell using an old metal basin, which are integrated into the sound design. basin aims to shake up some of the stereotypes associated with a female body and tries to ask questions like ""what can this body do/not do, and why/why not?""About ESPARTANÆESPARTANÆ, can be translated as ""spartans"". The dance presents the plurality (or kinds of) strength the character, Esparta, can feel and express. When the piece was conceived, ""I was inspired by feminine thinking (Vanessa Rosales, Miriam Toews, Bell Hooks) to challenge the capacities of my own body and discover what physical strength looked like in my body. How is strength distributed in my body? What makes me feel strong?"", says Andrea.",
