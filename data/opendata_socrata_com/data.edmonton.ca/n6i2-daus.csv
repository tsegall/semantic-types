DATA NOTES (from http://covid19stats.alberta.ca):
The Provincial Surveillance Information system (PSI) is a laboratory surveillance system which receives positive results for all Notifiable Diseases and diseases under laboratory surveillance from Alberta Precision Labs (APL). The system also receives negative results for a subset of organisms such as COVID-19. The system contains basic information on characteristics and demographics such as age, zone and gender.
Recovered is based on the assumption that a case is recovered 14 days after a particular date. For confirmed cases, we used specimen collected date and for probable cases, this is the date reported to Alberta Health.
Information such as hospitalizations and ICU admissions are received through enhanced case report forms sent by Alberta Health Services (AHS).
Disclaimer: The content and format of this report are subject to change. Cases are under investigation and numbers may fluctuate as cases are resolved. Data included in the interactive data application are up-to-date as of midday of the date of posting.","1233","2020-04-28T19:51:00.000Z","2020-11-12T01:30:00.000Z","Community Services","covid-19,ahs","376","Chris",,"See Terms of Use","published",,,"Alberta Health Services","https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm","Alberta Health Services","Automated",,"refer to 'Data Provided By'","Primary",,,"Other","opendata@edmonton.ca",,,,,,"Externally Sourced Data",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/jmcu-tz8y.json",,,,,,,,,,,,"X times per day","https://covid19stats.alberta.ca/",,,,"ikvd-2t7u",,,"official",,,,,

GPS coordinates are obtained from a cell phone, which is connected to an Arduino. A stretch sensor connected to the Arduino is used to detect where pesticide is sprayed.

Things to consider when working with this dataset:

The setup has been tested for accuracy but it is possible for equipment to report incorrect data. Values may be changed due to correction or re-calibration.  Values may also be incorrect due to malfunctioning equipment that went undetected for a period of time.","35","2020-04-16T17:29:00.000Z","2020-11-12T16:25:00.000Z","Pesticide","mosquito spraying,mosquito application,mosquito treatment","29","opendata@edmonton.ca","treebugs@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Roger Symon","Automated",,"Citizen Services","Primary","2020","ODR18-189","FME","treebugs@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","Pest Control.fmw","Internally Sourced Data ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/yvkj-876u.json",,,,,,"Community Standards and Neighbourhoods",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JWNnxu471a8DeP4V9ErNznicHFTpOjDv",,"Jun 20, 2019",,"Daily","In House Developed Software",,"To share with the public where applying treatment for mosquitoes took place.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme3:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/Pest%20Control.fmw","official",,,,,

The data is drawn from the Driver Feedback Sign data and transformed to produce this dataset:

https://data.edmonton.ca/dataset/Driver-Feedback-Sign-Aggregated-Data/h2v4-zkmj

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:

- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals 
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins) 
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting) 
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts) 
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not. 
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.

The data is drawn from the Driver Feedback Sign data and transformed to produce this dataset:

https://data.edmonton.ca/dataset/Driver-Feedback-Sign-Aggregated-Data/h2v4-zkmj

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:

- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals 
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins) 
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting) 
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts) 
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not. 
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr. 
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.

https://data.edmonton.ca/dataset/Driver-Feedback-Sign-Aggregated-Data/h2v4-zkmj

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:

- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals 
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins) 
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting) 
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts) 
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

Edmonton's bylaws are enacted by City Council and maintained by the Office of the City Clerk. The Office of the City Clerk is available to clarify information, if needed.

Copyright of City of Edmonton Bylaws belongs to the City of Edmonton. No person may reproduce bylaws for any purpose other than personal use without consent from the City of Edmonton. This consolidation has no legislative sanction and has been produced solely for research convenience.

The City of Edmonton is a member of the United Nations Women Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces program, which works toward solutions to improve safety and decrease sexual violence for women and girls in public spaces. 

The Edmonton: Safe City project has launched a web-based mapping tool called SafeCityYEG that allows Edmontonians to report where they feel unsafe or safe in their communities and why. By pinning locations on a map and identifying a safety concern or places where you feel comfortable, you are helping to influence change.

The primary goal of this project is to gain substantial user participation from Edmontonians and those visiting the city — with a strong focus on women and girls —  for a duration of up to one year. Depending on the results and feedback, this project may continue after the one-year mark.

The SafeCityYEG tool will be tracked based on the participation levels and feedback from users. Once the analytics are reviewed, the interdepartmental committee of Edmonton: Safe City, community partners and experts will use the data collected to ignite action. This may include working to change practices, policies, programs and initiatives within the City of Edmonton and other community organizations.

These collections are from standard New Jersey light traps that are commonly used to record changes in abundance of mosquitoes before and after control campaigns and to compare seasonal and annual fluctuations in population. Since not all mosquito species are attracted equally to light traps, the City uses a variety of other trapping and survey methods (with their own limitations) to monitor mosquitoes. Not all trap collection sites are factored into the historical averages. Some data can be incomplete due to trap failure. Some trap locations change over time. Trap collections reflect, not absolute population levels, but mosquito activity, which is influenced by changing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). The weekly averages do not include any male mosquitoes or any females of species that do not typically bite people. Each data set reflects the mosquito activity of the week previous to the collection date.

To complement this dataset, there is the Rainfall Gauge data which measures rainfall data in the Greater Edmonton area:

A brief description of how it works:

GPS coordinates are obtained from a cell phone, which is connected to an Arduino. A stretch sensor connected to the Arduino is used to detect where pesticide is sprayed.

Things to consider when working with this dataset:

The setup has been tested for accuracy but it is possible for equipment to report incorrect data. Values may be changed due to correction or re-calibration.  Values may also be incorrect due to malfunctioning equipment that went undetected for a period of time.","154","2019-06-20T21:24:00.000Z","2020-04-16T15:23:00.000Z","Pesticide","mosquito spraying,mosquito application,mosquito treatment","57","opendata@edmonton.ca","treebugs@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Roger Symon","Automated",,"Citizen Services","Primary","2019","ODR18-189","FME","treebugs@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","Pest Control.fmw","Internally Sourced Data ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/kkws-6gjr.json",,,,,,"Community Standards and Neighbourhoods",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JWNnxu471a8DeP4V9ErNznicHFTpOjDv",,"Jun 20, 2019",,"Daily","In House Developed Software",,"To share with the public where applying treatment for mosquitoes took place.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme3:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/Pest%20Control.fmw","official",,,,,

Latitude: 53.495636
Longitude: -113.42073

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.

Latitude: 53.482088
Longitude: -113.412205

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.

Per capita water use is the amount of water used by one person per day in litres/capita/day (lcd).  

Water Use Definitions:

""Residential Per Capita Use” includes both residential and multi-residential metered consumption within the City of Edmonton divided by the total Edmonton population.

“Total Per Capita Use” refers to total treated water production water minus water exported to regional customers divided by the total Edmonton population.

A residential customer uses water primarily for domestic purposes, where no more than four separate dwelling units are metered by a single water meter.
A multi-residential customer uses water primarily for domestic purposes, where more than four separate dwelling units are metered by a single water meter.
A regional customer is a customer outside the City of Edmonton who is supplied water through a water supply agreement.

In 2014, Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (AUMA) set targets to be achieved by the year 2020 for residential and total per capita water consumption.","174","2019-03-12T19:24:00.000Z","2020-10-26T20:40:00.000Z","Externally Sourced Datasets","per capita water consumption","29","opendata@edmonton.ca","opendata@epcor.com","See Terms of Use","published",,,"EPCOR",,"EPCOR","Manual",,"refer to 'Data Provided By'","Primary","2008 onward",,"Other","opendata@epcor.com",,,,,,"External",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/ixuc-gf7k.json",,,,,,"Water Services Inc.",,,,"Mar 18, 2019",,"Annually","EPCOR supplied",,"To provide the public access to per capita water consumption trends.",,"dhgx-s4x9",,,"official",,,,,

The following colors describe the capacity of the city block area water system under fire flow conditions using EPCOR-owned hydrants:

Red: 0-60 L/s
Orange: 60-100 L/s
Green: 100-180 L/s
Teal: 180-300 L/s
Blue: 300 L/s and up
No Data: No EPCOR-owned hydrants in Area

Important Considerations:

* EPCOR provides this data for information purposes only. EPCOR makes no guarantee, representation or warranty, express or implied, including that the data is true, accurate, complete, fit for a specific purpose or non-infringing, and no responsibility of any kind is accepted by EPCOR or EPCOR representatives for the completeness or accuracy of the data. EPCOR and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and other representatives shall not be liable to any person or entity as a result of the use or other handling of the data.

* The city block area average fire flow capacity can be used to evaluate average available fire flow in a relative manner: e.g. a blue area is anticipated to provide higher flows on average than a green area

*Any city block area that indicates 0-60L/s fire flow capacity has been evaluated by Edmonton Fire Rescue Services (EFRS). EFRS does not associate any significant risk with these areas and can adapt a response to a fire event in these areas given the small geographical area and buildings affected.

*The results presented in this data represent the overall average system capacity of the existing EPCOR-owned fire hydrants in the area during hydraulically modeled fire flow conditions. Other factors may change the available fire flow at any given time or place.

*The city block area average fire flow ranges are not indicative of city block area EPCOR-owned hydrant spacing.  A development may still require infrastructure upgrades to meet these minimum hydrant spacing requirements.

The devices used to collect this speed data are referred to as speed survey equipment. To read more about the devices used, please follow this link: 

http://mhcorbin.com/Products/Product-Detail/Article/43/NC350-BlueStar-Traffic-Analyzer

In order to align data that is collected by the speed survey equipment and the Driver Feedback Signs (DFS), the following has been done:

- Data has been aggregated into in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are aligned with the program settings for DFS units that collect data from roadways with the same speed limit
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

Data represented in this dataset was collected in 2017
Data represented in this dataset is not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, due to the aggregating factor and the alignment of speed ranges to that of DFS units.
Speed survey equipment has a minimum detectable speed of approximately 8 km/hr (which does not align with DFS units which has a 6 km/hr minimum detectable speed)
Speed survey equipment has a maximum detectable speed of approximately 193 km/hr (which also does not align with DFS units which has a 225 km/hr maximum detectable speed)
Speed survey equipment is not programmable (i.e. there are no parameter settings based on the speed limit or a timed schedule as to how to record the data)","124","2019-02-26T16:38:00.000Z","2019-02-27T23:55:00.000Z","Vehicle Speed","speed data collection,speeding","29","opendata@edmonton.ca","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Dennis Tetreault","Manual",,"City Operations","Primary","2017","ODR18-221","FME","dennis.tetreault@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","Speed Survey Data Upload.fmw","Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/467e-gsgf.json",,,,,,"Parks and Roads Services",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NQpIAEf7eBsAjvBL6juPcPInEj6Kzii_",,"Mar 1, 2019",,"Not Updated (Historical Only)","NC Series Data Collection Devices",,"To share with the public the collection of speed data at the various locations throughout Edmonton.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,,"official",,,,,

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","51","2019-02-14T22:24:00.000Z","2020-11-05T17:49:00.000Z","Vehicle Speed","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","65","opendata@edmonton.ca","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Dennis Tetreault","Automated",,"City Operations","Primary",,"ODR18-200","FME","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","DFS Data Upload.fmw","Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/d3qg-q9vy.json",,,,,,"Parks and Roads Services",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzwuihk9SzSJanSX5P4wjTfQU4mrKFRL",,"Nov 30, 2018",,"Weekly","TrafficCalm Driver Feedback Sign",,"To share with the public the collection of speed data at the various locations throughout Edmonton.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme2:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/DFS%20Data%20Upload.fmw","official",,,,,

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Latitude: 53.556068
Longitude: -113.504661

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","52","2018-12-21T16:31:00.000Z","2020-11-05T17:48:00.000Z","Vehicle Speed","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","67","opendata@edmonton.ca","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Dennis Tetreault","Automated",,"City Operations","Primary",,"ODR18-200","FME","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","DFS Data Upload.fmw","Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/chjw-t6qw.json",,,,,,"Parks and Roads Services",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzwuihk9SzSJanSX5P4wjTfQU4mrKFRL",,"Nov 30, 2018",,"Weekly","TrafficCalm Driver Feedback Sign",,"To share with the public the collection of speed data at the various locations throughout Edmonton.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme2:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/DFS%20Data%20Upload.fmw","official",,,,,

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","44","2018-12-14T16:39:00.000Z","2020-11-05T17:44:00.000Z","Vehicle Speed","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","63","opendata@edmonton.ca","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Dennis Tetreault","Automated",,"City Operations","Primary",,"ODR18-200","FME","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","DFS Data Upload.fmw","Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/xteg-4gxg.json",,,,,,"Parks and Roads Services",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzwuihk9SzSJanSX5P4wjTfQU4mrKFRL",,"Nov 30, 2018",,"Weekly","TrafficCalm Driver Feedback Sign",,"To share with the public the collection of speed data at the various locations throughout Edmonton.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme2:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/DFS%20Data%20Upload.fmw","official",,,,,

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.

This budget process allows City Council and Edmontonians to identify where the money is needed most and helps determine the budget to meet those needs. As part of this process, the City considers where the money to cover municipal programs and services comes from. One of the revenue sources for any municipality in Canada is property taxes.

To ensure that all Edmonton property owners pay their fair share of property taxes, the City follows the guidelines established by the provincial government and uses a property assessment process.

By legislation, the City collects only enough taxes to support its programs and services—it cannot collect more and it cannot collect less.

Ultimately, by paying your share of property taxes, you contribute to the financial stability of our community and support the quality of life for which Edmonton has become known.

This dataset is a breakdown of the historic tax rates, starting in 2014.

Over the past decade, City policy has shifted to manage natural areas with consideration of their role within an ecological network. Today, a goal of the City is to protect, preserve and enhance a functioning ecological network throughout the city limits. This network should include lands in both the river valley and the Tablelands.

To further this goal, a model was developed in 2015 for determining environmental sensitivity scores across the entirety of the city. This model guided the collection of several digital data layers with coverage across the entire study area (including several ecological assets, threats to assets, and development and cultural constraints). Data layers were then used to develop spatial outputs that summarized the distribution of these assets, threats and constraints. These base layers have been compiled into this dataset to help inform planning, development and conservation throughout Edmonton.

Environmental sensitivity analysis incorporated recent mapping of the ecological network of native and non-native vegetation, streams, wetlands and other waterbodies as much as possible, with practical limitations. The City’s urban Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (uPLVI) and remote sensing data used for this assessment were completed in 2015 and 2013 respectively, which is relatively recent, but not current. Similarly, infrastructure data (roads, subdivision development and stormwater facilities) provided varied in month of acquisition from 2015. Some discrepancy between mapped and actual features may result, due to loss and changes from ongoing development activities.","678","2018-10-19T20:57:00.000Z","2019-02-04T15:18:00.000Z","Environmental Services",,"152","opendata@edmonton.ca","UrbanAnalysis@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Catherine Shier","Manual",,"Urban Form & Corporate Strategic Development","Primary",,,"Other","UrbanAnalysis@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84",,"Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/kme6-3pd6.json",,,,,,"City Planning, Urban Analysis",,"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12ZbF2yh2ONTKUGoUdK2K_MIShz0ezCRx?ogsrc=32",,"November 6, 2018",,"Not Updated (Historical Only)",,,"In its 2010 Municipal Development Plan (The Way We Grow), the City of Edmonton identified one of nine strategic goals as “Edmonton protects, preserves, and enhances its natural environment by maintaining…a functioning ecological network within the Capital Region.”  To identify areas important for maintaining and developing this ecological network, the City of Edmonton undertook the Environmental Sensitivities Project. This project and its resulting ""sensitivity"" classification schema contained within this dataset was designed to help inform the City to manage sites relative to their suitability for some level of conservation or restoration, or alternatively, intensive use where appropriate.  Environmental Sensitivity Project Goals were to:  - Advance the City of Edmonton’s goal to protect, preserve and enhance its ecological network, as outlined in The Way We Grow (2010);  - Identify areas with significant ecological value (assets), potential threats to those assets, and physical and cultural constraints to development; and  - Summarize these factors into an environmental sensitivity score and classification system, which will help stakeholders consider the sustainability of biophysical assets within the City in future planning and land development decisions.",,"dhgx-s4x9",,,"official",,"1",,,

In order to align data that is collected by the speed survey equipment and the Driver Feedback Signs (DFS), the following has been done:

 - Data has been aggregated into in 15 minute intervals
 - Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
 - Speed range/interval for the bins are aligned with the program settings for DFS units that collect data from roadways with the same speed limit
 - The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.  Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

Data represented in this dataset was collected in 2018
Data represented in this dataset is not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, due to the aggregating factor and the alignment of speed ranges to that of DFS units.
Speed survey equipment has a minimum detectable speed of approximately 8 km/hr (which does not align with DFS units which has a 6 km/hr minimum detectable speed)

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city.  These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
 - Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
 - Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
 - Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
 - Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
 - The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10.  Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","89","2018-09-13T16:42:00.000Z","2020-11-05T17:40:00.000Z","Vehicle Speed","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","89","opendata@edmonton.ca","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Dennis Tetreault","Automated",,"City Operations","Primary",,"ODR18-200","FME","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","DFS Data Upload.fmw","Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/r3tw-abec.json",,,,,,"Parks and Roads Services",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzwuihk9SzSJanSX5P4wjTfQU4mrKFRL",,"Sep 30, 2018",,"Weekly","TrafficCalm Driver Feedback Sign",,"To share with the public the collection of speed data at the various locations throughout Edmonton.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme2:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/DFS%20Data%20Upload.fmw","official",,,,,

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.

Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","55","2018-08-15T14:36:00.000Z","2020-11-05T17:20:00.000Z","Vehicle Speed","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","84","opendata@edmonton.ca","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca","See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,"Dennis Tetreault","Automated",,"City Operations","Primary",,"ODR18-200","FME","copsparksandroadsservices@edmonton.ca",,,,"LL-WGS84","DFS Data Upload.fmw","Internal ",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/vqns-z8u6.json",,,,,,"Parks and Roads Services",,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzwuihk9SzSJanSX5P4wjTfQU4mrKFRL",,"Sep 30, 2018",,"Weekly","TrafficCalm Driver Feedback Sign",,"To share with the public the collection of speed data at the various locations throughout Edmonton.","FME Server","dhgx-s4x9",,"http://coevfme2:8081/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Open%20Data/DFS%20Data%20Upload.fmw","official",,,,,

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.

These benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.

The Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the “Hello, How Are You?” (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school’s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying “Hello, how are you?”

Age Friendly Edmonton Partnership
In a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city. These benches are specifically painted and wrapped in vinyl. Visit a bench today and make sure to say “Hello, How are you?”.

At time of publication, the uPLVI coverage included the City of Edmonton and a 3.2 km buffer. The uPLVI follows the framework of, and can be integrated with, the Province of Alberta’s Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (PLVI).  In order to capture the unique variation found in large urban settings the Provincial PLVI landcover types were modified. To provide more land-cover information within urban settings seventeen Site Types were added to the Provincial PLVI classification.  In addition, Seven PLVI Site Types were deemed inapplicable for urban settings. Ecological conditions in the uPLVI are interpreted specific to the availability of moisture and nutrients to plants (i.e. Moisture Regime & Nutrient Regime), using site factors and vegetation species as indicators.

These natural areas, in combination with semi-natural areas, are the foundation of a municipality’s ecological network – a key municipal asset that conserves both local ecological services and regional biodiversity. In order to effectively manage this asset, appropriate information is required to ensure the maintenance and restoration of ecological functions both now and into the future. In 2013 the City of Edmonton embarked on developing a spatial natural asset inventory to establish a baseline against which urban land cover and land use change can be measured and modeled. The uPLVI objectives are to: 1) Create a land cover inventory that is replicable and utilizes standards and protocols adopted by natural resource practitioners; 2) Map natural and semi-natural areas as well as areas of anthropogenic use within the Edmonton region that can be modified and updated over time; and 3) Provide a framework that, if built upon, could assist in land use planning for the Capital region.

What is Open Space?
Open spaces include all outdoor land and water that is publicly owned, and/or publicly accessible. Open spaces can be parks, plazas, boulevards, main streets, ceremonial spaces, natural and protected areas, community gardens, sports fields, and green infrastructure.

What is the Green Network Strategy?
Edmonton’s Green Network Strategy will examine how open space in the City of Edmonton functions as an integrated network of public spaces that provide real, measureable value to Edmontonians. Open spaces contribute to human health and wellness, improve the urban environment, and provide places for people to come together. These contributions are the central themes of the Green Network Strategy, and provide the organizing framework for assessing open space:
• Ecology: Supports and enhances the environment 
• Wellness: Promotes healthy living
• Celebration: Connects people to each other and builds a sense of place.

The Survey
By completing this survey, you are providing valuable information that will help the City of Edmonton develop an integrated network of open spaces that meets the needs and priorities of Edmontonians.

Development permits approve the use of a site, as well as the size and location of any buildings or structures. It is written approval from the City that development plans meet the Edmonton Zoning Bylaw regulations. An approved development permit is required before application for a building permit to construct the building or structure, or to apply for a business licence.

Some permits are combination permits. They combine both a development permit and a building permit in one application. This data set only represents the outcome of the development permit application. Building permit data is available through the General Building Permits dataset.

Naturalization is an ecologically-based approach to landscape management used to transform highly-maintained land to a more natural condition.

Naturalized areas in Edmonton are either constructed (for example, storm water management ponds or bioswales) or converted (formerly mowed turf transformed to a naturalized area).

These converted areas may remain naturalized grass or be planted with trees and shrubs. Citizens can volunteer to plant in these areas through the Root for Trees program.

Due to the constant changing of subsurface infrastructure (adding, upgrading, etc.) combined with the constant changing definition of a 1 in 100 year rainfall event (based on historic rainfall amounts), this raster file reflects the results of a study done in 2016 and should neither suggest previous year’s vulnerabilities nor future year’s vulnerabilities.

For a more regional Edmonton area breakdown of the Study’s results: 

https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/documents/RoadsTraffic/City-wide_Flood_Mitigation_Study.pdf

There are three different colour to the vulnerability of the roadways and the corresponding ponding depth that would occur for that area during a large rainstorm.


Those colours are:

Green (representing the depth from surface that sanitary flows can surcharge from less than 2.5 m)
Yellow (representing the depth from surface that sanitary flows can surcharge from 1.5 to 2.5 m)
Red (representing the depth from surface that sanitary flows can surcharge from greater than 1.5 m)

This Raster file is best viewed overlaid with the 2016 Flood Mitigation Study - Drainage and Sanitation Surcharge Map; as the various coloured areas follow the subsurface infrastructure (and the corresponding roadways if you are also viewing the street map as a layer).

20 school sites
(https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/urban_planning_and_design/surplus-school-building-sites.aspx)
in 19 neighbourhoods were declared surplus in 2006 and have been designated for the First Place housing program.

Completed projects across Edmonton have allowed many people to realize the dream of home ownership (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/first-place-stories.aspx) while integrating with communities that helped design the look and “fit” of the developments.
These families benefit from the opportunity to call a place their own and get ahead financially, but the community at large benefits too. Owning a home keeps families rooted in neighbourhoods, something that's needed for communities to flourish over time.

The homes are market priced, with a five-year deferral on the land portion of the mortgage, making them more accessible to first time buyers.

A public engagement
(https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/community-engagement-first-place.aspx)

Alberta Health monitors all supportive living and long-term care accommodations for compliance to the Accommodation Standards, minimally on an annual basis. The purpose of the Accommodation Standards is to ensure accommodations maintain a high quality of accommodation services (e.g. meals, building maintenance, security and housekeeping) that promote the safety, security and quality of life of Albertans living in those accommodations. Alberta Health currently reports publicly on the results of licensing and monitoring visits in supportive living and long-term care facilities across the province at http://standardsandlicensing.alberta.ca. This table provides statistics on supportive living and long-term care facilities and their compliance to the Accommodation Standards since April 1, 2013 as well as licensing and contact information.

USAGE CONSIDERATIONS
The accommodation data is collected from licensed operators through the licensing application process. The compliance data is collected by Licensing Inspectors when they visit accommodations to monitor compliance to the accommodation standards. The data collected is housed in a custom designed database named Accommodation Standards Licensing and Tracking (ASTRAL) System. The accommodation and compliance information from ASTRAL is published to http://standardsandlicensing.alberta.ca in ""real time"". The compliance information dates back to April 1, 2013 until the date of the dataset.

There are three different colour to the vulnerability of the roadways and the corresponding ponding depth that would occur for that area during a large rainstorm.


Those colours are:

Green (representing the depth from surface that sanitary flows can surcharge from less than 2.5 m)
Yellow (representing the depth from surface that sanitary flows can surcharge from 1.5 to 2.5 m)
Red (representing the depth from surface that sanitary flows can surcharge from greater than 1.5 m)

This dataset is based on 2014 information and will not be updated further. The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.

Model Accuracy:

For Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.

Due to the constant changing of subsurface infrastructure (adding, upgrading, etc.) combined with the constant changing definition of a 1 in 100 year rainfall event (based on historic rainfall amounts), this raster file reflects the results of a study done in 2016 and should neither suggest previous year’s vulnerabilities nor future year’s vulnerabilities.

There are four different colours to show the depth of water that might pool on the ground during a large rainstorm.

Those colours are:

Green (representing a ponding depth from 0.00 - 0.35 m)
Yellow (representing a ponding depth from 0.35 - 0.50 m)
Orange (representing a ponding depth from 0.50 to 0.75 m)
Red (representing a ponding depth greater than 0.75 m)

This dataset is based on 2014 information and will not be updated further. The model is based on a theoretical, worst-case scenario storm that has never occurred in the Edmonton area.

Model Accuracy:

For Areas west and central Digital Elevation Model was used from 2004.  For the rest of the areas Bare Earth LiDar data was used.  The surface data used was set to a horizontal resolution of 2.5 meters with a grid cell of 5m by 5m.  This puts the vertical resolution at an accuracy of 0.1 meters. 

This is a spline fit interpolations model.  This is a 1D-1D model with 2D interpolations.The accuracy of the information provided in these data sets is plus or minus 10 cm vertically, and 10 cm horizontally.

Checkstop operations are stationary points on roadways where traffic is contacted by police to ensure drivers are sober. Checkstop includes the activities from Target All Drunk Drivers (TADD), where following the closing of a Checkstop point, officers will patrol to make contact with any vehicles that draw their attention with the primary goal of checking the driver's sobriety.

Impaired Arrests (Checkstop/TADD) are the number of impaired driving arrests for driving with a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.08 or more, or there is other evidence of impairment by alcohol, driving while impaired from narcotics or prescription drugs, or when testing for alcohol or drugs is refused. 

Roadside Suspensions (Checkstop/TADD) are the number of Alberta Administrative License Sanctions for operating a motor vehicle contrary to the drivers license restrictions. Statistics here exclude roadside suspensions issued as part of a criminal charge of impaired driving. In simple terms, the types of roadside suspensions in this measure arise from: 

1. AZAT (Alberta Zero Alcohol Tolerance Program) – Issued to GDL drivers with a BAC above zero. 30 day suspension, 7 day vehicle seizure.

Response Time Performance measures the percentage of the time that EPS dispatches a priority call and gets patrol on-scene to the event in the targeted time. The targeted time varies by priority level. Time here does not include the time it takes before the call is made available to the dispatcher. EPS's long-standing target is to meet the targeted time for 80% of events. 

The calculation for Response Time Performance is based on a subset of Dispatch Call Volume; it excludes impaired driving calls (i.e., non-fixed location calls), on-view calls (patrol observes the event before the public calls it in), and follow-up calls. Hence, quarterly Response Time Performance cannot be converted to annual figures based on the data provided here.

Priority 1 through 5 calls are categorized as follows:

◦Priority 1: In Progress Person At Risk - a rapid response will likely prevent or reduce further harm to a person. E.g., assault with a weapon in progress. Target: 7 minutes or less.

◦Priority 2: In Progress Property At Risk - Immediate response will likely prevent or reduce the further loss of property. E.g., a citizen observing a theft of auto in progress. Target: 12 minutes or less.

◦Priority 3: Just Occurred - Immediate response will increase the likelihood of locating a suspect. E.g., a mischief that occurred very recently. Target: 17 minutes or less.

◦Priority 4: The Nature of the Occurrence is Time Sensitive. E.g., a shoplifter is in-custody with security and is cooperative. Target: 40 minutes or less.

◦Priority 5: General Service - The nature of the offence is not time sensitive. E.g., a business finds that they were vandalized the night before (i.e., the absence of in progress or just occurred). Target: 180 minutes or less.","685","2016-05-27T19:35:00.000Z","2019-11-14T23:21:00.000Z",,"eps,edmonton police service,police,police statistics,police response time,police response time performance,police response,dispatch call volume,call volume,police performance,police calls","99","schafer.cal",,,"published",,,,,,"Manual",,"Edmonton Police Service",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/3hzu-tepj.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"tz2i-jfnt",,,"official",,,,,

Public Complaints are formal complaints brought forward against EPS by the public. These formal complaints are related to allegations of wrong-doing by police members – either in violation of the Police Act or provincial or federal legislation – or focus on the policies and services provided by EPS.

Internal Complaints are formal complaints brought forward against EPS by EPS staff. 

Citizen Contacts are verbal or written contacts from the public to EPS or the Edmonton Police Commission. These files generally take the form of a concern related to the Police Service Regulation, or consist of a matter that is purely inquiry or assistance-based. TAs these files are below the threshold of a formal public complaint, they are not subject to formal investigations.

EPS Matters are internally generated files to be dealt by PSB without invoking the Police Act, or files brought to the attention of PSB for tracking purposes only.

When not engaging in proactive work, a patrol members time is spent either completing calls-for-service, administrative duties, or as “other” (e.g., getting set up for shift).

Proactive patrol work can be thought of as a policing investment that prevents or suppresses future criminality, or helps maintain public safety. Examples include patrolling a drinking establishment near closing time, searching out an individual with outstanding criminal warrants, or check in with a domestic-violence offender to ensure they are complying with their court ordered conditions.","205","2016-05-27T18:39:00.000Z","2019-11-14T23:10:00.000Z",,"eps,edmonton police service,police,police statistics,proactive time,proactive,proactive patrol time,police performance","80","schafer.cal",,,"published",,,,,,"Manual",,"Edmonton Police Service",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/75h8-as7j.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"tz2i-jfnt",,,"official",,,,,

This tool has been available to the public since the second quarter of 2013 to report less serious crimes online without having to file a report at a police station. Online reporting is a more efficient and streamlined reporting process, thus allowing EPS to redeploy its support resources to other organizational needs. The convenience of online reporting may encourage citizens to report crime that would otherwise go unreported; thus providing EPS with better intelligence about patterns of crime, which can improve police deployment to crime hot-spots.

Online Crime reporting is available for the following police matters:
◦Lost Property
◦Mischief
◦Theft from Vehicle (under $5,000)
◦Theft of Bicycle (under $5,000)
◦Theft under $5,000

Statistics here include:
-the number of EPS occurrence reports that were submitted by the public online, and approved by EPS
-the number of EPS occurrence reports that could have been reported online, but were reported by other means (e.g,. reporting at a police station)
-the percentage of EPS occurrence reports that were reported online (for occurrence types that have the option of being reported online)

A driver will face a criminal charge of impaired driving when they exceed a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.08, or when there is other evidence that a driver is impaired. The number of incidents here also includes impairment by narcotics or prescription medication, or when cooperation with testing for alcohol or drugs is refused.

An ""occurrence"" is a set of connected criminal events which constitute an occurrence report. The occurrence counts here are distinct from 'incidents' and 'victims' as reported by Statistics Canada. 

The crime types used here are for EPS's 4 Property Crime and 4 Violent Crime Indicators only. Hence, not every type of property crime or violent crime incident is shown here (e.g,. kidnapping and theft under $5,000 are excluded here). This also excludes criminal code violations that fall under Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. 

The criminal code that is used here is based on the most serious violation of the occurrence. For example, if a break & enter occurred that involved an aggravated assault, only the aggravated assault would be counted. This follows the standard for how Statistics Canada reports on crime throughout Canada.","2977","2016-01-25T21:42:00.000Z","2019-11-14T23:24:00.000Z",,"eps,edmonton police service,police,police statistics,crime,police data,eps statistics,occurrences,crime data,crime statistics,violent crime,property crime,eps 8 crime indicators,eps crime indicators,eps crime","282","schafer.cal",,,"published",,,,,,"Manual",,"External",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/7qpa-hyqe.json",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"tz2i-jfnt",,,"official",,,,,

This measure is calculated by considering all of the biological materials consumed and all of the biological wastes generated nationally per person. The national footprint is converted to represent Edmonton’s footprint by using a combination of Edmonton-specific household expenditure data (food, shelter, transportation, goods and services, and government services) and physical energy use data. The data comes from several government sources and surveys that are
conducted or published at varying time intervals. As a result, there are limitations and lags in reporting frequency and timing. Ecological footprint is one measure of  sustainability, but should not be considered an all-inclusive sustainability measure as it does not account for issues such as pollution and water consumption. An external consultant calculated results for 2006, 2012 and 2013 and extrapolated results for
2010, 2011 and 2014 based on these calculated results. As the City has limited control over Edmontonians’ consumption behaviour, Ecological Footprint is considered an indicator.","411","2015-09-11T19:34:00.000Z","2018-06-21T16:51:00.000Z",,,"91","General Section Email",,,"published",,,,,,"Manual",,"Sustainable Development",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/fm3b-s764.json",,,,,,"Urban Planning and Environment",,,,"September 22, 2015",,"Annually",,,"Ecological Footprint measures the resources Edmontonians consume and the waste they produce, compared to Earth’s ability to provide these resources and absorb the waste.",,"iinj-vg3f",,,"official",,,,,

Active transportation (e.g. cycling and walking) is an important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutants, fuel consumption, traffic and parking congestion, employee sick days, and healthcare costs. It also significantly improves people's physical and mental health, and saves households money on fuel, vehicle and parking expenses. 

Although only 26% of daily trips made are commutes to and from work, these are the trips that set the traffic patterns for each day, resulting in the period of vehicle traffic congestion and therefore influencing the capacity requirements of the transportation network. 

Generally, Edmonton is trending favourably in this measure with more people choosing to use active transportation and transit for their commutes. Increased environmental awareness, protected bike lanes, and an expanding transit network has made active and public transportation more popular. In coming years, Edmonton will continue to see significant infrastructure investments that will further encourage this shift. 

This data is collected as part of the municipal census, which is conducted every two years. The Total % Commuting Sustainably column is the total percentage of respondents who selected “transit,” “walking,” “cycling” to indicate how they travel to work.","914","2015-09-09T22:13:00.000Z","2019-02-12T22:30:00.000Z","Dashboard","transportation,journey to work,mode split,commute to work,work travel,cycling,biking,sustainable,mode,shift,active,shared,ghg,target,greenhouse gas,reduction,health,transit,walking,car,pool,pooling","114","General Section Email",,"See Terms of Use","published",,,"City of Edmonton",,,"Manual",,"Sustainable Development","Primary","2012 - 2016",,,,,,,,,"Internal",,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/gkts-bntw.json",,,,"February 12, 2019",,"Transportation Planning",,,,"September 22, 2015",,"Annually",,,"Journey to Work Mode measures the percentage of people who choose to get to work by a method other than driving themselves in a vehicle.",,"iinj-vg3f",,,"official",,,,,
