The team received applications, which is a significant increase over 2021 when applications were submitted. Based on feedback and a review of the process from a GBA+ perspective, the requirement to provide three letters of recommendation was removed from this recruitment campaign as a way to reduce barriers and it appears to have had a positive impact. . As of today, candidates have been recommended by the Civic Agency Chairs for shortlisting. We are still waiting on three reports from the Anti-Racism Advisory Committee, Community Services Advisory Board and Edmonton Combative Sports Commission. They will be shared as soon as the reports are available. Recruitment Process The Member Recruitment and Selection Process for Civic Agencies is outlined in Section 14 of Procedure C575D Agencies, Boards, Committees and Commissions. The membership of each Civic Agency is determined annually by Council, following a recommendation made by the associated Standing Committee. There are 4 steps remaining in the Recruitment and Selection Process: 1. Membership Report A Membership Report is presented by the Agency’s Chair to the Standing Committee. The Membership Report contains an evaluation of each member and provides a recommendation regarding reappointment for those eligible. The Standing Committee takes these into consideration when making reappointment recommendations to City Council. Page 1 s.17(1) s.17(1) s.17(1) 2. Shortlisting Candidates Vacancies occur when members: resign mid-term or express their intention not to seek reappointment; have reached the maximum term length; or their reappointment is not recommended. The Chair reviews each application received from members of the public who are interested in serving with the Agency and provides a recommended shortlist of candidates to be interviewed by the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee may accept this shortlist or adjusts it at their discretion. 3. Interviews Once a final shortlist is determined, the Standing Committee conducts interviews with each candidate. In order to accommodate the volume of shortlisted applicants, interviews are relatively brief, approximately ten minutes each. A list of interview questions is provided, which the Standing Committee may refine. Immediately following the interviews, the Standing Committee selects candidates to be recommended for appointment. 4. Appointments The Standing Committee’s appointment recommendations are given to City Council as the decision making body. Upcoming Meetings to Discuss Civic Agency Appointments As per previous Council direction, at the March 14, 2022, City Council meeting Council will be presented with an amending bylaw to change the composition of the Edmonton Police Commission to include an additional public member. There will also be an opportunity to discuss the path forward for the recruitment approach.

The Vehicle for Hire Program regulates the industry through administration of the Vehicle for Hire Bylaw 17400. The program also supports vehicle for hire users in alignment with The City Plan’s direction that Edmonton’s mobility system should be safe, secure, accessible and responsive. On March 7, 2022, Community and Public Service Committee will be provided with an update on the Vehicle for Hire Program’s initiatives that were undertaken in 2021 to promote safe and accessible vehicle for hire services in the city. The 2021 program initiatives included the completion of an Accessible Vehicle for Hire Needs Assessment. Key considerations and recommended actions resulting from the needs assessment are reflected in the program’s 2022 work plan. 2021 Vehicle for Hire Accessible Taxi Needs Assessment In 2021, based on feedback and recommendations received from stakeholders, the Vehicle for Hire Program commissioned Pivotal Research Inc. to complete an Accessible Vehicle for Hire Needs Assessment with the goal of improving overall accessibility of vehicle for hire (VFH) services in Edmonton. Key research objectives included: ● Identifying current and emerging best practices, including effective management of supply and demand of accessible taxis; ● Ascertaining the perspectives of supply-side stakeholders, including accessible taxi drivers and dispatchers in Edmonton; and ● Determining the demand for accessible VFH services, including a better understanding of accessible VFH user experiences. 1 / 2 Qualitative and quantitative research undertaken by Pivotal Research Inc. to achieve the objectives listed above resulted in key considerations and recommended actions in the Vehicle For Hire 2022 work plan..

Eng. Deputy City Manager Subject: 2022 U-Pass Update In response to the Omicron variant, the University of Alberta’s Administration decided to pivot to online classes for the majority of students from the onset of the 2022 winter term until February 28, 2022. Following this decision, the University of Alberta Students’ Union (UASU) requested that Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) rebate a portion of the winter 2022 U-Pass fee. With students now returning to on-campus learning, the UASU did not wish to exercise the existing provision in the contract to cancel the U-Pass program for the remainder of winter term, and has requested a partial rebate of the U-Pass fee as an alternative. Upon consideration of this request, ETS, along with regional partners in St. Albert, Strathcona County, Fort Saskatchewan, Spruce Grove, Leduc and Beaumont, will be issuing a rebate of $45 per student directly to the participating post-secondary institutions (University of Alberta, MacEwan University, NAIT and Norquest). This rebate will help support students who have been learning online and students who rely on transit. Each post-secondary institution in the U-Pass agreement will receive the rebate and are responsib le for notifying, coordinating and distributing the rebate directly to each student in their student body.

Eng. Deputy City Manager, City Operations Adam Laughlin Deputy City Manager, Integrated Infrastructure Services Subject: Spring 2022 LRT impacts due to maintenance projects A significant amount of LRT infrastructure is approaching 40 years of age and needs upgrades and maintenance to further improve the experience for riders and ensure the LRT keeps operating safely and efficiently for years to come. In early April, LRT service impacts will begin due to annual TLC for LRT maintenance and revitalization projects (Please see Appendix below). Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) riders are being informed of the following Capital/Metro Line LRT service changes: ● April 2-May 15, weekends only (Sat/Sun), and April 15 (Good Friday): Capital and Metro Line trains run every 15 minutes, with Metro Line trains only running between NAIT and Central stations. ● May 21-23: Capital and Metro Line trains run every 20 minutes, with Metro Line trains only running between NAIT and Central stations. Crews will be replacing escalators and modernizing elevators that have reached the end of their life cycle at a number of Capital Line LRT stations. Transit riders will be encouraged to call 311, or regularly check edmonton.ca/TransitAlerts , ETS Twitter , station signage or third-party apps (i.e. Google Maps, Transit app) for up-to-date LRT service information. More impacts related to this work and other major maintenance/revitalization projects will be announced this summer. Project information will be available at edmonton.ca/TLCforLRT . For more information regarding transit operations and service impacts, please contact Carrie Hotton-MacDonald , Branch Manager, Edmonton Transit Service. For more information regarding the construction projects, please contact Bruce Ferguson , Branch Manager, LRT Expansion and Renewal. …/2 -2- Appendix 1: LRT improvement projects for spring 2022 (in chronological order) Stadium LRT Station redevelopment The Stadium LRT Station Redevelopment project is scheduled for completion in summer 2022. The project includes closing the underground concourse, providing barrier-free access at the end of each platform and adding a new platform on the west side of the tracks. Improvements also include new heated shelters, new public washrooms and a new security office. Government Centre LRT Station project (track level drains and electrical system replacement) This project includes the life cycle replacement of the Government Centre LRT Station electrical system components and track level drainage system components. This work is scheduled to start on April 2 and will impact weekend LRT service for eight weekends. Contact wire replacement This work will address overhead catenary system wire replacement in the north system between Coliseum and Clareview, planned over two weekends (April 23-24 and May 7-8). LRT service impacts for this work coincide with the work at Government Centre Station. Churchill Diamond work One weekend (May 21-23) of rail work is needed in the track junction north of Churchill where the Capital and Metro Lines join. This will help make the rail in this area more robust. LRT service impacts for this work coincide with the work at Government Centre Station. Elevator and escalator replacement projects This project will include replacing eight elevators at Bay/Enterprise Square, Central, Corona and University stations. Each elevator is expected to be out of service for approximately two to three months. The first elevator replacement will be in early April. The project also includes replacing three escalators at Central Station. Construction will begin in the third week of April and will take approximately nine months to complete all three escalators. Up-to-date station accessibility information will be communicated to riders online, as well as through on-site signage, ETS Twitter and 311.

A brief survey was promoted through three channels — direct access through edmonton.ca/surveys, links shared through social media channels, and direct invitations to the Edmonton Insight Community. The survey was open between February 28, 2022 and March 7, 2022. Given the wide interest in this topic, the final dataset for the engagement activity contains 77,869 responses. The full results are available to Council and members of the public by accessing edmonton.ca/surveys. These results will also be available on Open Data by April 4, 2022 Further to Council’s request, the Insight Community responses (a subset of the survey responses) are included in the report. The Insight community is made up of more than 19,000 Edmontonians who have registered to share their opinions on a wide range of topics. While this group is demographically diverse, we know this community to be engaged Edmontonians with a high interest in shaping their City. While there are differences between the full data set and the Insight Community data set, neither data set revealed a definitive preference to mandate the use of masks in indoor public spaces, and neither data set revealed a definitive preference to remove the use of masks on transit. As Bylaw 19408 is now repealed, there are no plans to make any major announcements about the results — the preliminary themes and findings were previously reviewed and discussed, alongside other decision making inputs, at the March 8, 2022 City Council meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the research process.

A detailed briefing on Bylaw and Provincial Act Enforcement was provided in your City Council Orientation Guide on page 132 and the presentation from the session is included below. Key Messages: ● Bylaw and provincial act enforcement programs are normally developed in response to an issue and are usually reactionary, instead of proactive, as the perceptions of public safety are dynamic while being highly complex issues to solve. ● The enforcement environment is complex with many stakeholders contributing to the outcome of community safety and wellness. ● There are many partners within the corporation and in the community, all of whom work together to create community safety. ● Employee work is shifted from season to season in addition to the year-round work. ● A redeployment of enforcement personnel requires a minimum of six weeks lead time due to the notification periods outlined in collective bargaining agreements, and other services may need to be reduced or temporarily suspended during the period of redeployment. Emergency redeployment requires a union agreement and Letters of Understanding. ● The two types of enforcement can be broken down into uniformed and non-uniformed. ○ Uniformed officers are peace officers, who focus on public safety and education. If engagement and education prove unsuccessful, this group is tasked with applying a variety of enforcement measures and mechanisms including warnings, municipal tickets, provincial violation tickets, mandatory court summons, and arrests. ○ Non-uniformed officers include municipal enforcement officers, safety code officers and development compliance officers, who focus on property standards like snow on sidewalks, nuisance conditions, problem properties, and safety codes. ● In all interactions, officers follow the 4E model: engage, explain, encourage, and, as a last resort, enforce. In practice, this means an officer engages in a conversation, establishes awareness of the situation and allows individuals to express their concerns while the officer listens. Rules are explained and rationalized with empathy as officers consider social factors, cultural norms and trends to find resolutions. As a last resort, enforcement actions may be taken to instill a behavioural change in the interest of personal or public safety. When enforcement occurs and a fine is issued, ../2 - 2 - several principles are considered, including that fines act as a sufficient deterrent, reflect the severity of the offence, and establish a reasonable and fair punitive amount. ● To support the 4E approach, continuous improvement and professional development are necessary. In response to the Safer for All report and other community inputs around community safety and well-being, the curriculum of enforcement officers is being reviewed and updated to involve more community-led and trauma-informed education. ● Administration currently holds a contract with the Edmonton-based Mediation and Restorative Justice Centre to divert bylaw-related neighbour disputes and neighbourhood issues away from enforcement to more solution-focused and restorative processes. ● Enforcement officers can spend a significant portion of of their day on administrative duties due to the limitations of available technology and adequate records management systems. ● The retention rate of peace officers is not a statistic that can be separated from overall rates.

In fact, Lucy is in good overall condition. Although she continues to have respiratory issues, Lucy has no life-threatening conditions. Social media has not significantly picked up on the issue, but may in the future. City of Edmonton Position: The City takes great exception to any misinformation about the care Lucy receives in Edmonton. The City is committed to her welfare and provides the best care she would receive anywhere. Key Messages ● While the Edmonton Valley Zoo’s long-term goal is not to house elephants, the City of Edmonton will continue to make decisions in the best interest of Lucy as she enters her geriatric years. ● There have been no recent changes in Lucy’s health status and she has no life-threatening conditions. ● Lucy is entering her geriatric years. The City of Edmonton continuously monitors Lucy’s health and adapts strategies for her care based on the intimate knowledge zoo staff has of her condition, her age, scientific knowledge, and expert advice. ● Responsible and dedicated zoo staff have cared for Lucy for more than 40 years. ● Lucy is imprinted on people, meaning she gets her emotional support from people, not other animals. She has been at the Valley Zoo for 42 of her 44 years. Lucy is bonded with her zoo family, the people who interact with her every day. Approach : We are happy to speak with media and others about Lucy’s health, her care and her daily life. We understand that Edmontonians care deeply about Lucy and they are interested in the details of her care and welfare. Background: As shared with the community in the latest medical assessment in November, Lucy is in good overall condition although she continues to have respiratory issues. Lucy currently has no life-threatening conditions. Lucy is 44 years old. Healthy elephants in zoos or sanctuaries commonly live into their 50s; we hope Lucy will similarly live a long life, but we are continually adapting her care program appropriate to an elephant entering her geriatric years. As an aging elephant, she has aches and pains from arthritis which we have treated with Tramadol since 2016. Tramadol is an analgesic that can help control moderate to severe pain, but is not considered an opiate. Her arthritis is also managed through regular rehabilitation therapy, daily walks and laser treatments to reduce swelling and inflammation. In addition to her routine medical care by the Edmonton Valley Zoo’s veterinarian and animal care team, Lucy is assessed annually by an outside veterinarian. Lucy’s respiratory issues make it difficult for her to breathe when she is in a stressful situation, such as being transported or placed with unfamiliar caregivers.

This memo provides further detail about these activities, how that input will be considered in the budget development process and when Administration will provide updates on what we have heard. What we will ask Edmontonians The budget is a part of the City’s strategic framework. More than 10,000 Edmontonians were engaged in building ConnectEdmonton and The City Plan. Council endorsed The City Plan after the last election, and Administration is preparing a budget that activates The City Plan. Budget engagement should not reopen decisions that have already been made using public input, but should focus on how to bring that direction to life. Our research and engagement activities will be centred around one question: how to implement that direction, how much, how fast. What kind of input we can expect The City’s capital and operating budgets encompass all the work the City does. With so many programs and services to consider, we know that opinions on priorities will vary widely between individuals and communities, and it is certain that Edmontonians’ perspectives will likely not point in a clear direction. Administration will share with Council a picture of the range of 1 .. .. opinions and perspectives. This city-wide analysis will supplement the input that Council has received (and will receive) from their constituents. The research and engagement reports are not a standalone decision making tool —they are one of the many inputs to Council’s decision-making. Other inputs will include Priority Based Budgeting, economic information, Council policies, etc. Research and Engagement Phases Phase one: baseline research on value-for-tax perceptions In progress, completion May 2022 Purpose We are currently gathering quantitative and qualitative information to help us to understand Edmontonians’ perspectives about how the City spends public money and discover any gaps in understanding and awareness about the budget. The results of this study will not have a direct impact on the budget, but will give us guidance on the engagement approach, including what questions to ask, and how we can best communicate about the City’s financial information. Perspectives on tax tolerance will also be explored. Audience This is research, rather than engagement. It is limited in scope, but findings will be further expanded on in the engagement phase. The research consists of focus groups and one-on-one interviews to help us uncover perspectives. Their perspectives will then be tested in a survey of 1,000 participants. Updating Council Administration will share insights gained in this phase when the Capital and Operating Investment Outlooks are brought forward in early June. Phase two: budget engagement Early summer Purpose Because of the size and complexity of the City’s budget, any engagement activity requires an element of education as well. It’s important for participants to understand the imperative of tradeoffs and balance in building a public sector budget. The goal of the engagement is to validate priorities for City spending, as well as tolerance for increasing/adjusting City revenue streams. The engagement process will be fine-tuned based on the outcomes of phase one research, but we anticipate we will engage Edmontonians on the following topics: 2 Civic Survey ● Input on how participants would prioritize spending on City services and capital projects, including how to balance the long-term vision laid out in our strategic planning documents with current needs ● Further exploration of property tax and user fee tolerance (current or new) ● What to consider in making changes to property tax and user fees ● Input on opportunities to adjust costs and revenues Audience Administration will work to ensure that the engagement activities are easily accessible by any Edmontonian who is interested in participating. We will launch an awareness campaign that will include providing Council","that will include providing Council members with promotional materials to use through their channels. Extra effort will be made to reach equity-denied, under-represented and systematically excluded groups. Method This engagement effort will follow the City’s digital-first, in-person with intent approach. Our experience during the pandemic showed that online engagement alleviated barriers of time and access for most audiences. Harder to reach groups who don’t typically participate in online engagement will require targeted outreach (e.g. focused conversations). Updating Council Engagement will be conducted in the early summer and results will be shared with Council after the summer break. The input will be considered by Administration during budget development work as soon as it comes in. Phase three: civic survey Summer, update to Council in Fall, 2022 Purpose Administration is conducting a survey to explore Edmontonians’ views about living in Edmonton, and their perspectives on City service delivery. This includes understanding Edmontonians’ satisfaction with City services, the relative importance of these services, and the investment in services. This research is critical to advancing the City’s approach to improving our customer experience and it is necessary to gather information for several performance measures, including benchmarking with other Canadian cities. It is also intended to inform Council’s budget decisions with a current broad understanding of Edmontonians’ perspectives on our service levels. Audience / Method This is quantitative research, using a survey of 1,200 participants, as well as an online format to be open and accessible to all Edmontonians. Updating Council Results will be shared in early Fall. 3 Phase four: public hearing November 2022 As is our practice, there will be a non-statutory public hearing after the release of the draft budget so that individuals and impacted organizations can share their views directly with Council. Budget communications While this is not specifically engagement, it is important for Council to know that there will be a comprehensive integrated marketing and communications strategy to: ● Share the proposed budget and what that means for Edmontonians (including service and tax impacts) ● Share what we heard in previous phases and how we used that input in developing the proposed budget ● Demonstrate sound financial management and service excellence ● Keep Edmontonians informed about the process, including any final opportunities to participate in it (asking questions, public hearing etc.) Council member involvement Administration will update Council as analysis on each phase of research and engagement is completed. We will also provide cumulative updates and summaries at key points during Council discussions. To encourage participation, Administration will share details of all engagement opportunities with Council for you to amplify through your channels. If Council members have perspectives from constituents to share and to add to the information being collected, please contact Jodie Graham, Director, Budget Planning and Development.

As a result of all this change, and to better align with ConnectEdmonton and The City Plan, we have changed the branch name to be more inclusive of all that it does. Through a staff engagement process to help select a new name, we heard the following words and sentiments often; the branch is all about “community”, “recreation”, “culture” and “experiences” that help people feel happy, healthy and connected. To reflect this, the branch has changed its name to Community Recreation and Culture, effective today. Removing the word facilities and adding the word culture represents a subtle shift in the way we think about the branch but it is an important shift away from focusing on facilities and is more reflective of the work that is done by everyone in the branch. Using what we heard from staff, leadership, citizens and partners, as well as results of our surveys, the following statement was created to complement the name: Community Recreation and Culture - Creating opportunities to thrive, stay healthy, connected and included.

Peace officer designation is provided through the Government of Alberta’s Peace Officer Program. As a requirement of the City of Edmonton being an authorized employer in this program, Administration submits an annual report on peace officer activities from the prior year, including statistics and use of force incidents. In 2021, City Council directed Administration to share use of force information more frequently. As a result, Administration will provide the use of force statistics to City Council by memo every six months. Definitions ● Discipline - reprimand, suspension and/or termination in accordance with the collective agreement between the City of Edmonton and the applicable union. ● Hard empty hand techniques - physical control, strikes, and stuns designed to create reaction time and space for an officer to repel a physical attack, effect an arrest or radio for help ● Intermediate weapons - baton and oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray ● Reportable Event - listed under professional standards reporting Use of Force When responding to an incident, peace officers try to gain voluntary compliance through communication and discretion while engaging, explaining, and encouraging. This can be accomplished by starting conversations, offering education on behaviour and associated laws, providing officer presence, and issuing warnings. If these steps do not result in compliance, enforcement is the next step. Peace officers have authorities that allow for formal enforcement, including warnings, tickets, arrests, and use of force. Enforcement practices are based on a variety of factors such as the seriousness of the offence, history of occurrences involving the same individual, and other public safety considerations. During the course of their duties, it may become necessary for peace officers to use force proportional to the perceived threat and in keeping with the attached as established by the Solicitor General. Uses of force incidents are documented by peace officers in their notebooks and in their reports. Once a use of force report has been filed, the peace officer’s supervisor (typically a sergeant) and a management representative review the file. If inappropriate use of force is - 2 - suspected based on the event and report, the file is referred to a professional standards investigator and the training section for follow-up as deemed necessary. Professional Standards Reporting In accordance with the Peace Officer Act, the authorized employer of a peace officer is obligated to report certain occurrences related to peace officers to the Government of Alberta. Those occurrences are as follows: ● use of OC spray ● use of baton ● weapon was used by another person ● peace officer involved in serious injury or death of any person ● peace officer Canadian Police Information Center breach / violation ● peace officer injury or death ● peace officer assaulted by another person ● disciplinary or non-disciplinary measures have been enforced in accordance with the authorized employer and human resources policies and procedures ● charge or arrest of a peace officer under an Alberta act ● charge or arrest of a peace officer under the Criminal Code of Canada, Controlled Drugs and Substances Act or any other legislation in Canada ● resignation or retirement of a peace officer ● termination with cause of a peace officer ● lost or stolen peace officer identification card ● notice of public complaint of conduct and ● notice of an employer initiated complaint of conduct The public is also able to lodge complaints and provide commendations to peace officers in the following ways: ● calling the automated telephone inbox at 780-496-5747 ● emailing peaceofficerconcerns@edmonton.ca ● City of Edmonton website ● complete Public Complaint Form and submit by mail or fax ● phone 311 ● letter and/or email to City Council can be forwarded to Administration ● information forwarded from the Solicitor General Administration has one civilian investigator who receives and investigates complaints of service, policy, and conduct related to City peace officers. Concerns and informal complaints take approximately one to two weeks to inves","tigate while the time to investigate more serious allegations is dependent on the complexity of the file. The investigator addresses complaint matters for all City of Edmonton peace officers. Complaints and Use of Force Statistics In 2021, there were six formal complaints, two were initiated by Administration and four were initiated by public complaints. Two have been concluded, one has been referred to the Edmonton Police Service for further investigation, two are still under investigation, and one is resolved but awaiting the outcomes of a court decision. There were 38 reportable events under the Peace Officer Act in 2021, as outlined below. - 3 - 2021 Reportable Events TYPE TOTAL Reportable Events 38 Use of Force - Baton 9 Use of Force - OC Spray 14 Peace Officer Injury / Officer Assaulted 11 Subject Possessed a Weapon 3 Formal Discipline 1 A total of 129 total use of force events were reported in 2021, an increase over previous years, as outlined below.

The Community Peace Officer Induction Program is six weeks long. Although Administration has administered the program course with ad hoc provincial approval in the past, in 2022, Administration is seeking formal accreditation to deliver the program as needed in the future. Additional in-house training is delivered through a field training program in combination with classroom learning. Some external training delivery is informed, developed, and taught by members of marginalized communities. New courses Since July 2020, Administration has incorporated and mandated new training for branch members and management including GBA+ Application, Foundations of Diversity and Inclusion E-Learning, Diversity and Ourselves, and Introduction to Anti-Racism. A full-day trauma-informed leadership training by Native Counselling Services of Alberta will be added to the branch-wide course calendar in 2022. All peace officers and peace officer supervisory staff are required to complete Trauma Informed Care provided by Alberta Health Services (online). All animal protection peace officer investigators are also required to complete Animal Protection Evidence and Handling/Investigative Methods provided by the Edmonton Police Service. - 4 - Discontinued courses As part of a continuous improvement practice, Administration regularly reviews current course offerings and removes those that no longer meet the needs of the community or the team. Recent examples include the discontinuation of Mental Health First Aid which will now be covered within the City of Edmonton Working Minds training, LRT B-Book Level 1 Rules Qualification which is not required for the purposes of entering LRT railway tracks/areas, and Verbal Judo training which will transition to an Alberta Justice and Solicitor approved course called Strategic Communications.

Community parks are intended to meet the social, wellbeing and recreational needs of all Edmontonians. Some community parks are co-located with Community League facilities or schools. Community park assets may include a variety of physical amenities such as: playgrounds, walking paths, shade shelters, seating, trash bins, skateboard elements, bike racks, signage, plantings (natural assets) and splash pads. The current program for the development and renewal of community park assets is the Neighbourhood Park Development Program (NPDP). This program began nearly 40 years ago and has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in 1983. The Program was originally intended to leverage community resources and funding to keep pace with demands for park development. Over the last several budget cycles, challenges with the Program have been identified by community partners and Administration. NPDP places significant demand on the community as all NPDP projects require community initiation, substantial fundraising and volunteer effort. This also has the unintended consequence of creating inequity as park assets are developed and renewed based on community capacity. In addition, due to the partnership requirements, the City is not renewing or delivering assets where they are needed most. Over the last two budget cycles, the funding allocated to the renewal of community parks has been underspent due to a lack of community funding/capacity availability City-wide, while at the same time, some communities that have capacity have had assets renewed prior to the end of their life cycle. No other City assets are delivered or renewed in this manner. In 2020, Administration initiated work on a draft Community Parks Strategic Framework. The framework proposes replacement of the NPDP program with a new approach. The new approach - Community Parks Framework - aims to inform growth and renewal priorities for community parks. The purpose of this proposed framework is to improve equity, ensure policy alignment, optimize investment and ensure a more strategic, data driven approach is taken to community park development. 2 Proposed New Approach - Community Parks Framework The draft Community Parks Framework is a significant departure from the way the City and community have historically designed, developed and funded community parks. Under this proposed draft framework, the City would be responsible for the provision of core and specialty amenities including needs assessments, project initiation and funding. New and renewed park amenities will be prioritized using a decision making matrix that will consider service level targets, and data analysis of amenity use, condition, demand and demographics. This would align the provision of community park assets with the City Plan and the Infrastructure Asset Management Policy. The City will be able to prioritize amenities in a way that promotes equity and reduces issues of over provision of certain assets. Administration anticipates that a phased approach will be needed and implementation will need to be clearly defined. Communities currently advancing through the NPDP program will need clarity on the proposed transition and the proposed budget implications will need to be clearly articulated. The Community Led Construction Process will remain available to communities to incorporate amenities on licensed and leased land. Next Steps Targeted communications and engagement with external stakeholders is currently planned to occur between April and September 2022. The general public will have the opportunity to be informed and participate through various social media platforms. Public and stakeholder engagement in Q2 2022 will support incorporation of the framework objectives in alignment wi","th the 2023 to 2026 budget planning process. More information will be shared with Council as required once communication and engagement opportunities are progressed.

Except where postings contain specific educational requirements where they are considered bona fide requirements, language is usually limited to “ability to apply knowledge/training/education” in a specific subject matter area and “education is considered an asset”. ● Using the City’s Leadership Competencies, we are promoting further alignment at the Branch Manager and Director level across the organization by adding these competencies as links to 1 of 4 provide further information for job seekers in job postings. ● Supporting diversification of interview panels, including stakeholders in some circumstances, and encouraging hiring managers to consider potential interviewees at different levels who can bring a diverse perspective to the table. ● Hiring Manager Certification Training was updated in 2020 to include information on unconscious bias and how to integrate GBA+ principles throughout the hiring process. ● Encouraging hiring managers to share interview questions with candidates in advance of the interview, all or in part. ○ The sharing of the interview questions is a best practice in inclusive hiring that reduces bias, increases transparency and will provide each candidate the opportunity to present the highlights of their background and experience. ● Job postings are shared with internal networks such as the Race&Ethnicity@theCity Employee Resource Network (ERN) and the Edmonton Indigenous Employees Resource Network (EIERN). Talent Diversification and Inclusion shares postings with its network of over 60 stakeholders, including Indigenous organizations and community organizations representing equity seeking groups, upon request. Short Term (February - December 2022) ● Socialize the Guidelines for Inclusive Job Postings and Guide for Inclusive Hiring with hiring managers ensuring the strategic conversations narrow the gap between best practices regarding developing their job descriptions and job postings. ○ Review essential functions of the role: ■ Beware of including too many qualifications that may deter candidates from equity deserving and marginalized groups ■ Ensure that all requirements are bona fide and essential to the role ○ Where possible, focus on transferable knowledge, skills and competencies, however obtained, rather than years of experience or credentials: ■ What qualifications, skills and competencies are essential to perform this role? ■ Are there elements of the role that can be learned on the job? ■ Do any of the requirements prohibit people from applying based on their identity? ■ Is a driver's license really essential? ■ Are all physical requirements essential for doing the job? Are accommodations possible? ■ Have you considered including diversity a","ave you considered including diversity and inclusion competencies? ● Align job description language with the job posting language to support consistent application to business areas. ● Ensure interview plans and selection criteria are focused on the factors of know-how (however obtained), accountabilities, and problem-solving skills. ● Leverage the methodology and technology within the new Job Architecture System, which will provide a cornerstone for removing unconscious bias and will be aligned with GBA+ principles and the City’s commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. The new methodology for job evaluation examines all aspects of a job against a range of factors which contain no intrinsic bias and the weighting of the factors is also not biased in favor of one group and against another. ● Provide increased education and awareness to hiring managers that seniority within collective agreements is only to be applied as a criteria if all other aspects of the applicant’s capabilities are equal. 2 of 4 Longer Term (January 2023 forward) ● Aligned with the This is the Way We Learn and Grow learning strategy, and the City’s leadership development approach, support employees through learning and development opportunities that will allow them to gain skills, enhance their competencies, and participate in learning programs that will prepare them for and enhance their ability to compete for leadership positions. We will use the data captured in various City surveys and through other sources of data to identify underrepresentation in leadership positions, and monitor trends: ● Recruitment Diversity Survey ● Candidate Experience Survey ● Glint Survey ● Enterprise Commons ● Exit Survey Targeted Seasonal Hiring ● There is an intention to use targeted postings in 2022 seasonal hiring to support the City of Edmonton’s commitment to building a diverse workforce reflective of the community it serves. ● The Alberta Human Rights Act section 10.1 allows for targeted programs for equity seeking groups when the intention of the program is to ameliorate the conditions of disadvantaged groups, including those who are disadvantaged because of their race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, gender identity, gender expression, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income, family status or sexual orientation, and is reasonably likely to achieve this objective. ● Currently the City of Edmonton engages in a few postings targeted at certain demographic groups, such as: ○ Indigenous Summer Students; ○ Newcomer Internships; and, ○ Indigenous Interpreters, Chinese History Interpretors, Muslim History Interprters and Black History Interpreters (Fort Edmonton Park). ● Targeted recruitment of equity seeking candidates also occurs when lived experience with a marginalized identity is a bona fide job requirement, for example in our Equity Specialist role. In these cases, “lived experience” is included in the job posting in order to attract equity seeking candidates. ● Two postings targeting Indigenous people and women in seasonal entry level positions in the Parks and Roads Branch have been identified and if these targeted postings are successful in 2022, they can be expanded to other business areas in subsequent years. ● These entry level positions (Traffic Operations and Bridges) will be posted in April for the Spring/Summer season (once the recall list is exhausted). ● There are two restrictions on the postings: ○ Targeted postings will not impact the recall of employees on the recall list. ○ Targeted postings will be limited to entry level positions that are not influenced by seniority, such as Labour 1 (L1). 3 of 4 ● Indigenous people experience systemic barriers to employment including attitudinal barriers and biases from hiring managers , legacies of colonialism and intergenerational trauma. Creating a targeted posting for Indigenous peoples: ○ Aligns with the Truth and Reconciliation Committee’s Call to Action 92, which states: “Ensure that Aboriginal peoples have equitable access to jobs, training and education opportunities in the corporate sector.” ○ Supports the Indigenous Framework’s Commitment number 7 to: “Identify and remove the systemic barriers that exist for Indigenous people in gaining employment with the City of Edmonton and create career development opportunities for Indigenous employees.” ○ Strengthens our relationships with Indigenous organizations such as Oteenow and Rupertsland. ● Women are significantly underrepresented in L1 positions at the City. Creating a targeted posting for women will: ○ Decrease the isolation of women currently in business areas dominated by men. ○ Support the Art of Inclusion: our DIversity and Inclusion Framework that commits to “Implement talent acquisition programs and initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in targeted occupations.” ● Targeted postings that aim to ameliorate historical inequalities and underrepresentation in the workforce can raise concerns that all candidates do not have access to equal opportunities. It is important to note that there will still be seasonal postings that all candidates can apply to. Kimberly Armstrong c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk 4","No",,,

By all accounts, the Symposium was very well received by the industry. Over the day, several key aspects were raised by the speakers, moderators and stakeholders: ● TOD is a change from how we’ve developed in the recent past and that means that we also collectively need to change. ● TOD is a part of city shaping and community building that is required to create vibrant, livable, and economically thriving places. To have successful TOD in Edmonton, we heard that we collectively need to think differently about various things: ○ How to strongly integrate land use policy and planning with transit infrastructure, ○ How to build for changing and new markets as our population grows. We are seeing see more millennials, ageing population, and empty nesters, among others wanting a style of living that has been less common than in the past, ○ How to program spaces to make them attractive destinations. ● We need to provide certainty of City commitment to building supportive infrastructure ● We should examine new and innovative approaches to collaborate and partner with the private sector to create more value for the community and city. The outcomes of the Symposium will help inform the City Plan and also develop a planning/policy framework in support of the TOD vision. Participants were very keen on building an ongoing dialogue on TOD and they liked the approach taken at this Symposium. Administration will consider next steps in this key stakeholder engagement.

For these sites, RAH intended to develop two duplexes and three semi-detached structures, providing a total of 10 near-market affordable housing units (46-52 bedrooms). This memo provides a progress update on the development. The pre-development application meeting with the City identified that RAH’s initial development design would require lane upgrades that would render the project financially unfeasible for the organization. RAH completed a redesign to ensure the major components of the original proposal would remain intact. In particular: ● The same lots would be transferred to RAH, simply with the consolidation of Lots 1-3 and Lots 4-5 to support the new design; ● The development will include two semi-detached houses and two garden suites. Each semi-detached house includes two principal dwellings and two secondary suites, maintaining a total of 10 near-market affordable housing units; ● The redesign enables the addition of a community amenity space (community garden and recreation use), which is a value-add for the residents and community; and ● There would be a reduction in the number of bedrooms (38-42), but the overall required unit count of 10 would be maintained. RAH presented the redesign to community members at an online meeting held on July 22, 2021. The design changes are still within the parameters of the sale agreement and affordable housing agreement approvals granted by Executive Committee under CR_8303. Administration intends to enter into new sales agreements and affordable housing agreements to reflect the above changes to the proposed development. RAH anticipates obtaining development permits by September of 2022 and completing the development by September 2023.

This generated interest from both the media and the public. TransEd Partners, the consortium responsible for designing and building the Valley Line Southeast LRT, has recently resumed train testing. This testing is part of TransEd’s commissioning process and allows them to review the operation of various train, track infrastructure, and system components. Below are some messages to respond to inquiries you may receive about this train testing: ● TransEd has been conducting dynamic train testing in the downtown core between the 102nd Street Stop and the Muttart Conservatory. Testing is also happening along 66 Street. ● Dynamic testing ensures that the train’s braking system, wheels and overhead catenary line (that powers the trains) are working properly and that the train is operating smoothly along the tracks. ● Trains will be travelling anywhere between 10km/h-50km/h, depending on the testing location. Flaggers are present at intersections within testing locations to direct traffic. ● We ask that Edmontonians please follow all signs and signals to keep everyone safe. If you see tracks, expect a train. Below are some general messages for the Valley Line Southeast: ● Valley Line Southeast LRT will run between Mill Woods and downtown, and will be a significant addition to our City’s integrated transit network. ● Valley Line Southeast is a low-floor system, and is different from the Capital Line and Metro Line: ○ Valley Line Southeast is more integrated into communities, and trains will run alongside the road with motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. ○ Due to its community design, there is no need for crossing arms, gates or bells. ● TransEd is currently anticipating service commencement later this summer. 1 ● The City is continuing to work closely with TransEd to have the line open for safe, reliable service as soon as possible. ● Edmontonians’ investment is protected through our contract with TransEd and the contract helps ensure we receive good value for tax dollars.

In advance of the meeting, we wanted to provide you with an update on the work completed to support water quality in Hawrelak Lake as part of the rehabilitation project. Expanded uses of the lake have been explored by Administration since the City first hosted the World Triathlon Championships in 2001. Such opportunities, in response to previous Committee and Council motions, have included the process to create a permanent beach on the lake in Hawrelak Park and the action required to make the lake more swimmable as presented at Community Services Committee on October 17, 2011 (2011CSR023 Outdoor Aquatic Strategy). More recently, Administration conducted a study on the expanded uses of Hawrelak Park Lake including an in-depth study of the current water quality of the lake. The findings were presented at the April 14, 2021 Community and Public Services Committee meeting (CR_8015 Expanded Uses of Hawrelak Park Lake). The report established the root causes of the poor water quality identified as waterfowl, lake sediment, surface runoff, river filling and fertilizer, all leading to high phosphorus levels; and provided a summary of an ecological and holistic approach to manage the root causes that could allow for the potential expanded use of the lake. As a follow-up to the April 14, 2021 meeting, Administration took the following steps: ● Facilitated an independent review of the City’s consultant study - Hawrelak Lake Water Quality Feasibility Study by Resource Environmental Solutions (RES) - by Ray Menard of Algae Control Canada and Dorte Koster of Associated Environmental; ● Held a subsequent meeting on June 25, 2021 with the review panel and the project team, including the project’s ecologist, to discuss the feedback provided from the review; and ● Completed additional water quality testing in fall 2021 which confirmed the current assumptions used to develop the long-term management approach. Through this review it was determined that an adaptive management approach is required to sustain the water quality of the lake. An adaptive management approach consists of a structured iterative process aiming to reduce uncertainty over time via monitoring. This is needed because it is not possible to 2 accurately predict the response of the waterbody to the measures being recommended. The approach will include the following: ● As an initial step, the best management practices presented in Attachment 1 of CR_8015 Expanded Uses of Hawrelak Park Lake will be implemented as part of the rehabilitation project to manage the water quality; ● Ongoing water and sediment testing and monitoring will take place during and after the implementation of the best management practices; ● Based on the result of the water testing, Administration will adapt its approach and learn to support the long-term sustainability of the lake; and ● If the current approach does not achieve the anticipated outcome, Administration will take further steps to adapt and try different strategies depending on the problem identified through the systematic testing. The William Hawrelak Park Rehabilitation Project is moving into Detailed Design and will continue to advance design on the lake improvements per the recommended approach.

Based on further evaluation of the hazard of COVID-19 in our workplace, effective April 4, COVID-19 workplace controls will change. Physical distancing will no longer be required and masking will be optional in all City workplaces and vehicles, except transit. The workplace controls that are continuing include pre-shift screening, isolation and quarantine requirements, staying home when unwell, reporting cases of COVID-19, cleaning and disinfection, personal hygiene practices, as well as the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy. Please review this document to understand which controls will be eased and those which will remain in place. It is critical for all leaders and employees to be aware of and understand how these changes impact their specific work location. The City has received enough COVID-19 rapid test kits from the Province for all employees to have ready access to a test at home in case they develop symptoms. Staff who develop symptoms are expected to use a test to determine whether they are COVID-19 positive and stay home as per isolation requirements. The Office of the City Clerk will coordinate distributing boxes (each box contains five tests) to the Mayor’s and Councillors’ Offices.

The City of Edmonton currently owns the building and is in the process of completing a sale of the property to a new owner, T3 Development LP By Its General Partner T3 Development GP Inc. CURRENT ACTIONS (Immediate) 1. That a Notice of Intention to Designate a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1, be served on the future owners of a portion of the property located at 101 Airport Road NW in accordance with Section 26 of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9. 1 2. That the City Manager be appointed to implement matters arising from the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Designate Hangar 11 as a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1. FUTURE ACTIONS (At least 60 days after the Notice of Intention to Designate is served) 1 On November 26, 2019, City Council passed amendments to the City Administration Bylaw, delegating approval of Notices of Intention to Designate (NOI) under the Historical Resources Act (HRA) to the City Manager, where the owner consents to the designation of their property. The NOI initiates the designation process under the Historical Resources Act ; the final decision on designation remains with City Council by way of a bylaw. 1 1. Pursuant to the provisions of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9, a Bylaw to Designate Hangar 11 as Municipal Historic Resource (the “Bylaw”) will be brought forward to Council for their consideration. 2. If approved, the Bylaw and corresponding Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will contemplate funding of up to $5,000,000 to be provided over a ten-year period from the Heritage Resources Reserve to fund City-funded work on Hangar 11, as described in Attachment 5. BACKGROUND Hangar 11 is on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton, and merits designation under City Policy C450B - Policy to Encourage the Designation and Rehabilitation of Municipal Historic Resources in Edmonton. The building was constructed in 1942 by the United States Army Air Force (predecessor to the modern US Air Force), and features International style influences. The building was one of four major hangars and several dozen other small buildings constructed on the Blatchford Field site as part of the Northwest Staging Route. This initiative, a cooperative partnership between the United States, United Kingdom and Canadian governments, channeled critical Lend-Lease aid and materials from the United States to the Soviet Union through Alberta and Alaska. Much of the aid was used by the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, after the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany through Operation Barbarossa in June 1941. It is estimated that between 7,000 to 10,000 aircraft and thousands of tons of other war materials were channeled through the Blatchford Field site between 1942 and 1944. On February 1, 2021, Executive Committee directed Administration to negotiate a draft agreement for the sale of the Hangar 11 site to Architure Inc. (reference report CR_6367 ). On June 28, 2021, City Council authorized the sale of the Hangar 11 building by the City to the applicant, Architure Inc. (reference report FCS00411 ). A condition of the sale of the building was its designation as a Municipal Historic Resource and its rehabilitation. Architure Inc. has since created a new corporate entity for the purposes of the purchase of the land and building, known as T3 Development LP By Its General Partner T3 Development GP Inc. The final Designation Bylaw and the associated Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will reference the new corporate entity. A rezoning for the future Hangar 11 site was approved by City Council on September 8, 2021, under Charter Bylaw 19837 . The future Hangar 11 site was approved for subdivision by the City of Edmonton Subdivision Authority on September 9, 2021. The future parcel is currently awaiting registration by Alberta Land Titles. The final Designation Bylaw and the associated Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will reference the new legal","description of the parcel. 2 On November 24, 2021, the owners completed the application requirements to have Hangar 11, located on a portion of the property at 101 Airport Road, designated as a Municipal Historic Resource under the provisions of City Policy C450B. If designated, any future renovation of Hangar 11 will be required to meet the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the Heritage Resources Reserve will pay the owner up to $5,000,000 for rehabilitation over a 10-year period, or up to a maximum of $500,000 per year. This would be an exception to the current practice of the program, which currently limits non-residential properties to a maximum total grant of $500,000 for rehabilitation work (up to 50 per cent of eligible costs) from the Reserve. Given the significant scale of the building and the associated rehabilitation costs, which vastly exceed what is typically seen in other non-residential properties, and the international-level significance of the building, Administration is supportive of the request from the future owner. Through the process to sell the property to the new owner, there was awareness that a potential grant request for this building could exceed the typical program limits. This type of approach was also utilized for the designation of the former Molson Brewery building in 2016, where a grant of $4,175,000 was provided to the owner, spread over a 10-year period to limit the annual impact on the Heritage Resources Reserve. The grant Agreement for the former Molson Brewery building expires in 2025. After a review of future projections for the Reserve with Finance, it has been determined that the current Reserve balance is generally sufficient to cover the committed funding, including Hangar 11. Depending on the nature of future applications for designation of other buildings, potential rehabilitation grants from the Reserve may need to be limited to ensure an appropriate balance in the Reserve is maintained. The total estimated cost of the eligible heritage rehabilitation work for the project is $12,649,162. The estimated cost of the overall project is $62.5 million. Beyond the $5,000,000 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, which is less than 50 per cent of eligible heritage rehabilitation costs, the owner is responsible for all costs of the heritage rehabilitation work and broader costs for the project. The projections for the Reserve (using current commitments) anticipate a Reserve balance of $3,579,954 at the end of 2022. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. Based on the current commitments, including the proposed annual allocation for Hangar 11, the Reserve balance is anticipated to decline to a balance of $1,348,410 at the end of 2023. The Reserve is funded by the tax levy on an annual basis ($2.3 million in 2022, including $417,500 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd.). 3 PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT Public engagement was not undertaken as part of this process, as it is not required under the Historical Resources Act . c:","No",,,

This memo provides context and information regarding the fire protection infrastructure upgrades in redeveloping communities and the Infill Fire Protection Program developed to support infill development. Historically, at significant cost, infill developers have provided the fire protection infrastructure (hydrants and watermains) required to serve a new development and/or upgrade an existing area. However, upgrades that improve fire protection in developing areas can benefit an entire neighbourhood. Following the success of a pilot project in 2020 and 2021, a program has been developed to share costs between infill developers and EPCOR water ratepayers to support infill development, improve fire protection benefits for existing neighbourhoods, and align with City Plan direction. EPCOR has allocated $20.2 million to the cost share program for 2022-2026 with program information available at Infill Fire Protection Program (epcor.com). Complementing the Infill Fire Protection Program, the City (Fire Rescue Services) and EPCOR Water have implemented a new review process to determine the level of water infrastructure for on-street fire protection required with infill development. During the review of a development permit application, EPCOR Water conditions water infrastructure upgrades based on the requirements of the City of Edmonton Construction and Design Standards which look at the highest use permitted under the Zoning Bylaw. Fire Rescue Services can complete a site-specific review to assess existing hydrant spacing and fire flows, using the methodology outlined in the Fire Underwriters Survey. This assessment process provides a technical basis to relax the upgrades required according to the Design and Construction Standards should the existing fire flows and hydrant spacing be found to be sufficient as a result of the site-specific assessment for the subject site and can potentially eliminate or reduce the large financial barriers for projects posed by those upgrades. To date this additional review process has achieved over $89 million in deferred infrastructure upgrades. The Fire flow standards currently in place were developed in the early 1990’s by the City of Edmonton based on a review of the Building Code and Fire Underwriters’ Survey recommended standards and typical building types for each land use zone. These were developed when primary development was in greenfield development where site specific details of building form is not known at time of pipe design. FRS, with support from EPCOR is reviewing the standards so that water infrastructure requirements better reflect the site specific building plans.

In many cases, retrofit projects may include updating existing infrastructure, or working within constraints. For example, retrofit projects often make use of existing infrastructure for bike lanes, reducing the cost estimate provided above. Because roadway projects require more space, they are more likely to impact utilities which can result in increased costs. The specific costs vary from project to project depending on the local context and design. There may also be opportunities to implement adaptable infrastructure similar to what was installed for the downtown bike network, which may be a cheaper alternative in some contexts. Regarding the percentage of population that use bike lanes vs cars. The most recent data available on this is from the 2015 household travel survey. This survey showed the following mode split among Edmonton residents. ● Car Driver - 57.4% ● Car Passenger - 20.2% ● Active Transportation - 12.5% ● Transit - 9.8% This survey showed that cycling was the fastest growing mode of transportation, more than doubling from 25,300 to 54,800 daily bike trips between 2005 and 2015. Note that this data was collected before the construction of protected bike lanes in the central area and other updates to our active modes network which also impact the number of users. For example, local counts showed that the number of bike trips made downtown increased from 2,796 trips daily in June 2017 to 6,501 trips daily in June 2018 after the downtown bike network was installed.

It is a prominent landmark, notable for its scale and grandeur. Heritage Value The Magrath Mansion is significant as a rare example of Classical Revival style residential design in Edmonton and for its associations with the early development of the neighborhood of Highlands, real estate developer William Magrath and architect Ernest Morehouse. Originally from Ontario, real estate developer and businessman William Magrath and his wife Ada arrived in Edmonton in 1904, attracted by the promise of opportunity in the west. By 1910, Magrath and his partner Bidwell Holgate had formed the Magrath-Holgate Company and purchased the land on what was then Edmonton’s eastern boundary, where the contemporary neighborhood of Highlands is located, with the intention of developing a suburb catering to Edmonton’s elite. Buoyed by the optimism of the pre-WW1 real estate boom, the Magrath-Holgate Company invested heavily in Highlands, which became part of Edmonton following its annexation in 1911. The Magraths took up residence in the stately mansion in 1913, just as Edmonton’s economy descended into a prolonged recession with only 50 of the more than 550 lots the Magrath-Holgate Company had subdivided in Highlands having been developed. It would take decades for Edmonton to recover and for Highlands to finish building out, and Magrath died in 1920 well before the community was fully realized. By 1931, Ada Magrath was unable to continue to pay the property taxes for the mansion and it was seized by the City. Ada Boulevard that runs along the top-of-bank in front of the Magrath Mansion is still named for her. Ernest Morehouse, who designed the Magrath Mansion, trained as an architect in Toronto before eventually moving to Edmonton in 1910. He was retained by the Magrath-Holgate Company to design the high-end residences of their ambitious new development. More than any other architect, he had a significant impact on the early development of Highlands, designing 13 of the buildings that were constructed there between 1912 and 1915. In addition to the Magrath Mansion, they included the Gibbard Block, Highlands Methodist Church and the Holgate Residence. Morehouse employed a broad range of architectural styles, which is embodied in the eclectic historic architecture of contemporary Highlands. The Magrath Mansion’s Classical Revival style architecture is most evident in the formal, symmetrical design of the south facing facade with wide central staircase and Attachment 4 projecting two-storey colonnade supported by classical columns and crowned by an entablature with a deep, bracketed cornice. It is an architectural style that was usually reserved for grand civic buildings like courthouses, libraries and post offices. The Magrath Mansion’s Classical Revival style design was intended to convey the grandeur of Magrath’s vision for Highlands and his commitment to it. Character-defining Elements Key character-defining elements of the Magrath Mansion site include: ● Sightlines to the North Saskatchewan River ● The spatial relationship between the building and surrounding grounds Key character-defining elements of the Magrath Mansion’s exterior include: ● Form, scale and massing ● The pattern, style and construction of all window and doors ● Red brick exterior with quoins and sandstone belt course above foundation ● Hipped roof with moulded red clay roof tiles and gabled dormers with returned eaves and widow's walk ● Brick chimneys with corbels ● Projecting two-storey colonnade supported by classical columns with Ionic capitals and crowned by a entablature and a deeply projecting bracketed cornice ● Ground floor porch and second storey balcony extending the full width of the south facade and wrapping onto the east facade, terminating in a on-storey circular porch and porte cochere with ionic columns and entablature ● Architectural detailing including window hoods, balustrades and classical door and window surrounds Key character-defining elements of the Magrath Mansion’s interior include: ● Wood elements including doors, wainscotting, columns, capitals, arches, mouldings, trim, window and door surrounds, ceiling beams, built-in cabinets and staircase ● Ornate finishes including sculptured plaster ceilings, plaster cornices, inlaid parquet floors, stenciled and hand painted finishes, stained mahogany paneling in the dining room and hammered brass fireplace mantel ● French chandelier in reception area ● Remnants of luxurious period conveniences including intercom units","No",,,

Edmonton residents who are interested in upgrading the energy efficiency of their homes can now  apply for low-cost financing under the City’s new Clean Energy Improvement Program.  The two-year pilot program provides access to low-cost financing to help Edmontonians make a  minimum of three energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades to residential homes. A second  pilot for commercial properties will roll out later in 2022. The process involves the City  providing $11.25 million in financing and rebates to address most upfront costs. The financing is  then repaid by the property owners through the owners’ property taxes.  The City received a $9.69-million loan from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) Green  Municipal Fund to develop and launch the program.  Alberta Municipalities will administer the pilot. The CEIP aims to advance efforts to improve  environmental resiliency as part of Edmonton’s Community Energy Transition Strategy and Action  Plan. The residential program is forecasted to support an estimated 80 residential projects over  the two-year pilot. The commercial retrofit pilot is anticipated to support approximately 20  projects when launched in 2022.

History and current state: Between 2014 and 2017 the Development Compliance Team put a greater focus on investigating non-permitted trucking operations in response to complaints received from nearby residents and property owners. Concerns raised about noise, safety, dust and damaged roads were reported across the city and the majority were from Ward 4. In addition to the concerns raised by nearby residents and businesses, non-permitted storage and operational trucking facilities present financial and environmental risks that are mitigated through the permitting process. The City is committed to working with these business owners in a fair and equitable way so that we don’t provide any advantage or disadvantage to one area or group of properties over another. 1 2. Helping operators come into compliance: There are options available to business owners, including relocating to an existing industrial park or rezoning the property to allow for the trucking operation. There are a number of existing industrial parks that provide the necessary infrastructure and zoning which are considered suitable location options for trucking operations. Economic and Environmental Sustainability (EEC) could work to help truck yard businesses find new locations if the proposed location is not able to be developed into a trucking operation. EEC is best suited to providing business support services to the business owners. If relocating the trucking business is not an option, the department can assist business owners through the rezoning process. New zones are not needed to accommodate these developments as they can already be classified under three existing uses - General Contractor Services, General Industrial, and Temporary Storage. Temporary Storage is for sites used solely for storing trucks. General Industrial is for sites where there is also a building on site. General Contractor Services allows for the storage of construction vehicles normally associated with the contractor service. Under each of these classifications, there are numerous zones that allow for trucking operations. These uses can be found in either a standard zone or Special Area, and are mainly located on industrial lands, and in specific areas in the Edmonton Energy and Technology Park and Ellerslie Industrial. A transitional zone or temporary zoning will unlikely provide a solution. A direct control or DC Provision with a sunset clause would likely result in issues with non-compliance reemerging after the expiry of the permit as the business owner would likely wish to continue to operate. It is worth noting that depending on the business’s location, a rezoning may also require plan amendments and review of a long term vision for the area. For example, accommodating truck yard businesses in areas where the City is expecting higher quality industrial development may create challenges in the longer term. The City has about 150 development permits on file related to trucking operations. 2 These may or may not be operational, as a cross reference to business licensing data has not been undertaken. 3 3. Development Standards: Non-permitted trucking operations pose financial and environmental risks that are addressed through the permitting process. Where practical, roadways used to access truck yards should be constructed to handle truck loading. In many areas of the city though, operators access their property on older rural roadways, which can cause significant damage and safety concerns. This can result in the City funding all maintenance and upgrades, and addressing complaints from other users. If the road base fails, it would become very difficult to maintain and will require reconstruction to the City standards at City cost. During the permitting process, the City can mitigate this issue by requesting a geotechnical investigation to confirm if the road is designed to carry frequent truck load. The Zoning Bylaw requires industrial developments to meet general performance standards such as locating trucking yards to the rear or sides of buildings and screening them from view from any public roadway with landscaping materials, berms, walls or fencing. The City’s Drainage Design Standards details requirements for treatin","g stormwater. Truck operations near a water body need to control erosion, sedimentation and release of contaminants such as hydrocarbons. Wastewater from washing trucks also need to be treated before being released. Truck operations near the North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine System need to address stormwater and wastewater, and there may also be natural features or habitat such as upland treestands and wetlands impacted or destroyed by illegal land developments. Several policies outline what may need to be addressed, including the Development Setbacks from River Valley/Ravine Crests Policy, Policy C531 on Natural Area Systems, and provincial legislation such as the Public Lands Act and Water Act. If an operation impacts an environmentally sensitive area, it may also require an Ecological Network Report. 4. Aligning with regional regulation of trucking operations: Surrounding municipalities, including Leduc, Parkland, Sturgeon and Strathcona Counties, and Town of Devon, as well as the City of Calgary, were contacted to determine the issues they are facing with truck yards. 4 These municipalities didn’t report facing the same scale of issues as in the City of Edmonton. It is generally not a problem in Leduc County since most truck operations are in the Nisku Industrial Area, Strathcona County confines truck operations to industrial areas and Town of Devon has not seen any issues with truck operations. Generally, Parkland and Strathcona County, and the City of Calgary have one or two investigations involving non-permitted truck operations per year. Most truck yards tend to get valid permits and comply with the respective regulations. The City of Edmonton is generally aligned with other municipalities in the way they deal with non-permitted truck yards. Most municipalities pursue enforcement in order for the truck operations to become compliant, which was deemed to be highly successful in Calgary, and Leduc, Parkland and Strathcona Counties. Enforcement is typically triggered by complaints from adjacent property owners. For development criteria, most municipalities have requirements and standards that are outlined in their Zoning or Land Use Bylaw provisions, and which depend on their location and underlying zone or plans for the area. For example, the City of Calgary allows trucking operations under Vehicle Storage - Large and Freight Yards, and requires dust treatment, parking, surface and landscaping requirements, and does not allow trucking operations under the Home Based Business use. 5. Use of Revolving Industrial Servicing Fund (RISF) to assist with costs to rezone and obtain Development Permit approval: The current policy doesn’t allow the City to assist with these costs, so pursuing this option would require a policy amendment or a new policy. Also the RISF has been replaced with the Industrial Cost Sharing Program C592. The intent of this program is to assist developers in recovering their infrastructure oversizing costs (over and above their share). When a landowner is rezoning or developing, they are typically the only party benefiting, so it is considered a cost of doing business, not an ""oversizing"" cost from which other landowners will benefit. 6. Implications of locating truck yards in the Edmonton Energy and Technology Park (EETP): A trucking operation under the Temporary Storage Use is not the highest and best use for the EETP. These types of operations in other areas of the city have created barriers to servicing and higher value development once serviced 5 development advances around them. Therefore, there is a concern trucking operations within EETP could become a roadblock for future development. The City has also proceeded with litigation to ensure that non-permitted truck storage facilities are not permitted to operate in the Edmonton Energy Technology Park (EETP) area. In 2017, City Lawyers attended the Court of Appeal to prevent truck storage facilities from being approved as Home Based Businesses. The Court of Appeal ruled in the City's favour and determined that a truck storage facility could not lawfully exist as a Major Home Based Business. Administration strives to ensure that non-permitted trucking operations are supported so that they do not negatively impact adjacent properties and residents. We continue to work closely with owners of trucking operations in a fair and equitable way and support them as we work to bring them into compliance. c: Executive Leadership Team Maria Stopainig, Acting Branch Manager, Development Services Peter Ohm, Chief Planner, City Planning Lyla Peter, Director, Development & Zoning Services Livia Balone, Director, Planning Coordination Denis Beaudry, Acting City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk 6","No",,,

Given the complexity of this work, Communications and Engagement is taking a thoughtful and considered approach across several bodies of work to ensure an appropriate balance is struck. Advertising Advertising is one tactic used by Communications and Engagement to share information with Edmontonians. Advertising is approached strategically through broader communications planning that considers target audiences and any unique requirements or considerations around communication in languages other than English. After the communications objectives and strategies are confirmed, tactics are identified within the campaign’s overall budget. Communications and Engagement manages a centralized process for advertising — this means that when the “agency of record” is engaged for advertising needs, Communications and Engagement works collaboratively with the agency and client group to determine how advertising dollars can be best spent to achieve the plan’s objectives. In the communications industry in North America, agencies of record are specialized communications firms that are typically chosen 1 Census Profile, 2016 Census, Edmonton, City, Updated October 27, 2021, https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=481106 1&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=edmonton&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Visible%20minority&TABID=1&ty pe=1 (accessed May 20, 2022) 2 by competitive procurement agreements to buy media (advertising) on behalf of a client. Using an agency of record as opposed to going directly to individual media outlets can realize considerable cost savings in overall advertising expenditures. The advertising that the agency of record can consider includes billboards, signage, print, digital including social channels, etc. When the agency of record determines the advertising plan and purchases, audience reach and cost are two significant factors. There is ongoing work in this area to determine how the City’s agency of record should consider non-English speaking media outlets. Through engagement with non-traditional, online and specialized/targeted media, administration will provide direction to the agency of record related to non-English speaking media outlets should be in place by the end of Q1 2023. This timeline is due to the in-depth engagement and conversations Administration has planned so that we can thoroughly understand how best to meet the needs of these additional media partners. In the meantime, this does not preclude any Councillor from pursuing advertising for their Ward communications matters in a language other than English, using their own budgets. Relationships with non-traditional, online or specialized/targeted media The media landscape has changed significantly over the last number of years. Today, Edmonton only has one major, daily print publisher (Postmedia, which issues both the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun) and we continue to require the services of this publisher to satisfy our mandatory legal advertising needs. Many other non-traditional, online or specialized/targeted media have emerged within this shifting landscape. These new media channels are challenging the historical definition of media, journalism and journalists and with that change, the relationship with the media also needs to be re-examined. Communications and Engagement is currently engaging with non-traditional, online and specialized/targeted media outlets to establish how working together in","ow working together in this changing media landscape could provide mutual benefit. How the City has previously worked alongside more traditional media will need to evolve to meet the needs of this new opportunity and ensure benefit for all. Multilingual Framework The decision to offer information in languages other than English is highly complex. For example, it is not simply a matter of translating materials into the languages spoken by the most populous diasporas in Edmonton, as these communities may have high levels of English speaking and comprehension. As evidenced by some major communications stumbles by multinational corporations (when campaigns were translated without sufficient scrutiny), it is important that any translation is verified to confirm that the intent of the messaging is maintained and is culturally appropriate. Additionally, we must also look at the target audiences, the subject matter and the lifespan of the particular communications product, among other factors. It is also important to consider how, if communications products are offered in other languages, there might be an expectation established of continuity of language offering to the service itself. Communications and Engagement has developed a framework to guide decisions on providing information in languages other than English. These principles will guide Administration's decisions on translating materials: ● Integrated Approach: Except in special circumstances, such as information directed only at specific language communities, multilingual services will be considered not in isolation, but as a part of a broader communication strategy. This principle is very similar to how we approach advertising. ● Inclusive of Community: Community resources will be engaged to identify priority languages, effective processes, and meaningful channels for multilingual services through the translation and/or interpretation process. 3 ● Research and Evidence Based: Opportunities and decisions about multilingual services will be informed by evidence collected through community-based research, including up-to-date demolinguistic data and lived experience provided by community resources. ● Meaningful Communication: Creating meaningful translation and interpretation are complex processes: starting with a plain language source, they require a measure of flexibility and “cultural brokering” in converting information into other languages, allowing for linguistic, grammatical, conceptual, experiential and cultural differences to convey the intended meaning of the original message. Literal translation/interpretation does not often accomplish this. ● Effective Channels: Various channels of communication will be considered, to meet a wide variety of ways in which people with language barriers access information. ● Leverage Technology: There are many technological tools that provide useful multilingual information and services. The City will review and utilize technology where useful, appropriate for the intended audience(s), and feasible. ● Consistent Application: The methods used to develop, evaluate and engage in multilingual information and services will be consistently applied as outlined in the procedures in the framework. There is a recognition that this will need to scale slowly as time and budget realities will present constraints to how much support can be provided. As work is undertaken, awareness and demand for materials and services will increase, making the use of a consistent and feasible approach paramount. ● Realistic Expectations: While efforts will be made to offer equitable access to information and services in languages other than English, budget and time constraints will impact the frequency that this will occur. In some cases, communications may be offered in a language other than English, and the associated service may only be offered in English. Multilingual communications can be costly and time consuming and the principles noted above reveal its complexity. While dedicated funding does not currently exist to offer communications in multiple languages, this framework means Communications and Engagement can more confidently provide advice to City colleagues on how best to reach Edmontonians who may be better served by accessing translated information. We also continue to encourage plain language communications (for example, avoiding complex language, colloquial terms or jargon), to allow for the best outcomes for people who rely on technology-based language translation tools. These four bodies of work noted (reaching Edmontonians, advertising, relationships with non-traditional, online or specialized/targeted media and the Multilingual Framework) are complex and nuanced. Communications and Engagement will ensure a balance of considerations as the work advances and next steps are identified and actioned. Please let us know if you have any questions.

The platform has authentic Edmonton content including downloadable, free photos, video, stories and facts that anyone can use to talk about and promote our city. The goals of the platform are to: 1. Equip partners with Edmonton content that can help them connect with their audiences and support their individual goals. These partners all have a role in making Edmonton a vibrant, prosperous and livable place, including: economic development agencies, post-secondary institutions, arts and culture organizations, business community, non-profits, etc. 2. Build awareness and pride in Edmontonians to inspire them to become ambassadors and share Edmonton stories with each other and, in the longer term, friends and family outside of Edmonton. The platform delivers on two strategies in the Place Brand Strategy (action 19 of the Economic Action Plan): 6.1. Profile Edmonton people, businesses, innovations and organizations and 6.2. Develop a library of brand assets. Over the next three months, during the launch phase, 30+ stories will be published on Why.edmonton.ca. After the launch phase, new content will be published frequently to continue to profile Edmonton and Edmotnonians. As we move into the next phase of the project there will be further collaboration with partners and new features and content themes added to the site. This is an answer to one of the questions you’ve asked us recently: “how can we get the good news out about Edmonton?”. Our goal isn’t to monopolize the Edmonton story; it's to amplify it. Multiple organizations sharing diverse perspectives will help share the more complete and authentic Edmonton story. We hope that Council will take the opportunity to explore the site, visit often and share the many stories that capture what, and who, makes this place uniquely Edmonton.

Street sweeping will run Monday to Friday, 24 hours a day. Residential roads will be the focus during the day and high-volume roads will be swept at night. Spring sweep is expected to be completed in eight weeks. Edmontonians can help do their part by moving their vehicles and providing our crews plenty of room to work as they clear sand and debris from boulevards and streets. Vehicles left on the road when our crews come into the neighbourhood may be given a courtesy tow around the block to allow room for sweeping. Residents are also reminded that if they use driveway ramps in front of their homes, they must remove them for sweeping. Leaving these ramps out could impact the completion of an area. The City has informed the Business Improvement Area (BIA) partners of this work and will continue to engage and support the BIAs. The City is responsible for sweeping all public roadways but not all public sidewalks. This is the one time of year the City encourages citizens/businesses to sweep sidewalk debris onto the road in advance of the street sweeping in their area. The City will inform citizens with a Public Service Announcement on April 8, as well as social media posts. A media event will also be held on April 8 at 10:00 a.m. to help kick off the start of this service. To alert residents in advance of clearing in their areas, we will also be placing signage in neighbourhoods. Edmontonians can check the spring sweep schedule using an interactive map available at edmonton.ca/streetsweeping .

Below are the specific details of this engagement in the form of a message that can be sent to any of your constituents who you think would like to participate. Message to Constituents Background In Edmonton, since 2019, the number of people experiencing homelessness and the number of encampment-related complaints to 311 have doubled. Nearly 800 people are estimated to be unsheltered on any given night. The City’s response to this complex problem of homeless encampments looks to balance these various priorities: ● Connecting people experiencing homelessness to safe, adequate, and culturally appropriate housing ● The safety and well-being of people living in and near encampments ● The concerns of businesses and their customers located near encampments ● Keeping public lands safe and clean Here is the current process of how the City and its partners respond when we are notified of a potential encampment. The Opportunity To ensure that the City effectively balances each of the priorities mentioned above, City Administration would like to meet with you to better understand your unique concerns and needs regarding how the City responds to encampments. City Administration will be hosting various virtual focus groups listed below. ● Tuesday, June 28, 2:30 pm - 4:00 pm ● Tuesday, June 28, 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm ● Wednesday, June 29, 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm ● Thursday, June 30, 9:00 am - 10:30 am ../ 2 - 2 - To attend any of these sessions or if you would prefer to take City Administration on an in-person site visit so that they can have a first-hand experience of your concerns, please email dallas.dyson@edmonton.ca or rebecca.visscher@edmonton.ca to make the arrangements. What we will do with this information City Administration has currently contracted M.A.P.S Alberta Capital Region to engage with individuals who have lived or are living in an encampment to better understand their particular needs and point of view. This Fall, Administration will use the information collected from both engagements to identify ways that we can enhance our current response in a way that meaningfully balances all the competing priorities mentioned above. This will take the form of: ● Developing prototypes with community members and organizational partners to improve outcomes for all impacted groups. Here is an example of how another City initiative used prototypes to address a complex problem. ● Identifying and implementing process improvements.

Eng, Deputy City Manager Subject: Community Initiated Off-Leash Parks This memo outlines the City’s mechanisms to create or enhance dog off-leash areas, including information about a review that was completed in 2019-2020 on options for community-initiated off-leash areas. Dogs in Open Spaces Strategy Since the 1990s, the majority of Edmonton’s 57 existing off-leash areas were established without standards or guidelines and were mostly in response to public requests. This resulted in uneven and unequitable distribution of off-leash areas across the city. In 2016, after public engagement and stakeholder consultation, Council approved the Dogs in Open Spaces Strategy . The strategy outlines best practices and recommendations for planning, designing and managing existing and new off-leash areas. Since the implementation of the Dogs in Open Spaces Strategy: ● Three new off-leash areas were built: Manning Village (developer-led), Paisley (developer-led), and Alex Decoteau Park (City-led). ● One new off-leash area is planned for construction in 2022 in The Orchards (developer-led). ● New off-leash areas will be built in Alberta Ave, Garneau, Pleasantview, Glengarry within two to three years (City-led). ● Six existing off-leash areas (Lauderdale, Inglewood, Buena Vista, Royal Gardens, Montrose, Hermitage) were enhanced through capital projects or in coordination with the Building Great Neighbourhoods program. ● Enhancement to Eastwood off-leash area is scheduled for 2022. ● Public engagement on enhancement of Callingwood and Keheewin/Bearspaw off-leash areas is in progress. Mechanisms for Creating New Off-Leash Areas The City currently prioritizes developing new, or enhancing current off-leash areas, in alignment with the Dogs in Open Spaces Strategy and based on community need. This includes population, density of licenced dogs, proximity to existing off-leash areas and community feedback (e.g. public engagement, 311 notifications and Councillor inquiries). Off-leash areas can be established in the following ways: ● City-led capital projects …/2 -2- ● The temporary off-leash program , currently available to Community Leagues, has received applications from seven Community Leagues for the 2022 season to-date ● Businesses/not-for-profits on private land, such as the privately run 104th Ave Off-leash Dog Park downtown, and Central Bark by the Edmonton Humane Society ● Developers can build off-leash areas through self-funded initiatives or through the City’s Shared Park Development Program. This partnership allows developers to design and construct above base-level amenities which are accepted by the City for maintenance and operation: ○ Urban Development Institute (UDI) was engaged to help create landscape design standards and an off-leash areas manual specifically for developers . ○ Developers have access to a Neighbourhood Heat Map which demonstrates priorities for new off-leash areas based on current off-leash area distribution, walking distance recommendations, community interest and dog-licensing data. Review of Off-Leash Areas to be Funded, Built and Managed by Community Groups From 2019 to 2020, in response to a motion from Council, Administration performed a thorough review of the Neighbourhood Park Development Program and Community Group Led Construction Projects program as possible avenues for community-initiated off-leash areas. The review, which included feedback from Council, Community Leagues, residents and internal stakeholders, identified that community-funded off-leash areas: ● Create inequity for residents who are unable to fund community-led projects. ● Lack ongoing operational resources for the City to maintain the off-leash areas and provide enforcement. ● Are less strategic about the location, planning, design and management of these amenities. ● Can create conflict within communities between residents who support the off-leash area and residents who do not. Administration is currently working to advance a Community Parks Strategic Framework (CPSF) as part of the 2023-2026 capital budget process. The draft framework proposes to include off-leash areas as secondary amenities. New and renewed park amenities will be prioritized using a matrix that will include service level targets and data analysis of amenity use, condition, demand and demographics. Next Steps Administrat","inistration will continue to work on priorities to enhance and establish off-leash areas through the capital planning process by working with communities and developers.

This need was identified by the City of Edmonton’s internal COVID-19 Task Team in response to specific concerns identified by City Hall stakeholders, evolving deployment models, and in the context of the City’s overall approach to Community Safety and Wellbeing. This initiative will begin the week of April 11, 2022, and includes four key areas for action: 1. Relationship Building a. The Social Development branch will have a dedicated Social Worker available in City Hall on Tuesdays and Thursdays, getting to know those that work, conduct business, and frequent the public domain. The intent is that they will be available to support the building of a more inclusive space, through the implementation of the Compassion to Action training, and model, mentor, and coach framework. This dedicated resource has already started introducing herself to the staff at City Hall and will continue to reach out to those she hasn’t met yet with each visit. 2. Training a. As part of the Excellent Interactions Resource, the provision of the Compassion to Action course will be available to targeted employees (security staff and those who frequently interact with members of the public) early in the second quarter. This one-day course explores the impacts of addiction, mental health, homelessness, and suicide on individuals and offers strategies for relationship-based connection. Participants will also learn about the wide array of social service organizations available in the immediate area that may be of assistance in engaging with marginalized and vulnerable individuals. 3. Model, Mentor, Coach: ● Administration’s Social Worker will continue to visit City Hall Tuesdays and Thursdays following the training sessions to support staff in implementing their learnings. They will lead by example by behaviour modeling and being available as a mentor and coach to anyone looking for additional support in assuring a compassionate, human-centered response is provided to all those who visit the public spaces in and around City Hall. 4. RECOVER ● In order to build a sustainable and more comprehensive approach to creating a more inclusive City Hall and contribute to an increased sense of safety for all building occupants, Social Development is leveraging work with the RECOVER process to co-create additional innovative solutions to complex issues experienced in City Hall and the Civic Precinct. RECOVER is grounded in human-centered design and spends time understanding challenges through in-depth conversations to gain the perspectives of the people at the heart of each issue.

Community gardens can be developed in these locations: ● parkland that is licensed to a community league ● parkland that is leased to other registered not for profit community groups ● open space parkland outside of an existing licensed area ○ the community must enter into a maintenance agreement with Parkland Management prior to initiating the project Community gardens developed on land that is not owned by the City of Edmonton are not required to follow the PDDM process. Best practices for garden development are provided to groups in workshops hosted by Sustainable Food Edmonton . City Operations, Community Services, Integrated Infrastructure Services, Urban Planning and Economy, and Sustainable Food Edmonton support the establishment of community gardens. Improvements Made In order to identify opportunities to expedite the creation of garden beds, Administration has been piloting pop up gardens . This pilot is entering its third year and has been successful in providing temporary community garden spaces. Additionally, in February 2020 several improvements to the Community Group Led Construction Process were implemented, including better alignment with the PDDM and scaling development requirements to the size, scope, cost and risks associated with the projects. The Community Project Manual was re-written to ensure accessible language and clarity. Employees involved in the permanent community gardens process have received training on the new manual and improved processes. - 2 - These changes have reduced project delivery times from an average of six months to one year down to an average of three to six months depending on the scope and scale of the garden. A basic garden project can take approximately 3 months from idea to reality including; forming a garden committee and assigning tasks, planning the garden, and receiving city approval. A more involved garden project can take 4 to 6 months depending on the number and type of amenities and the development of the agreement. Administration has established a community advisory group of Edmontonians, community league members and a representative of the Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues (EFCL) to provide input and feedback on processes, manuals, templates and other tools used in the development of community-led projects. In Progress Improvements ● Aligning submission dates with Sustainable Food Edmonton’s grant ● Clarifying and simplifying the standard form Community Garden Licence Agreement ● Creating a single, shared database of community-led projects that includes community gardens ● Developing Community Garden Guidelines, including requirements for edible landscaping (Summer 2022) ● Developing tools and templates to further simplify the process and increase efficiency ● Educating and supporting community groups to apply early in order to achieve their desired build date ● Implementing a timed/deadline driven application intake process for permanent community gardens ● Improving mapping of garden sites ● Improving application cycles to access funding and reduce lags ● Prioritizing applications and assigning project managers based on the community group’s readiness to move from the Strategy Phase into the Concept and Design Phases ○ Projects are currently assigned on a first come-first served basis ● Refining and delivering workshops on the community garden development process If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact David Jones, Branch Manager, Community Standards and Neighbourhoods at 780-903-3386 or david.jonescsn@edmonton.ca .

JF/mt c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Roger Jevne, Branch Manager, Community Recreation and Culture Adam Norget, Lawyer, Legal Services Tips for Communicating with a Person who is Deaf, Deafened or Hard of Hearing This tip sheet was created by individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing for the purpose of helping hearing people to communicate with any individual who is Deaf or Hard of Hearing more effectively. All of these tips are easy to do, but some may require a conscious effort at first to make them an integrated part of your communication process. DO: ✓ Face the person when speaking with them ✓ Ask the person what you can do to make communication easier. The person who is Deaf or Hard of Hearing will let you know their preferred method of communication. ✓ If the room has higher noise activity than usual, please attempt to move to a quieter area. Employ backup communication methods if there is a lot of noise or visual activity. ✓ Make sure the light is shining on your face, not behind you. Avoid standing in front of a light source when speaking. Make sure you have the person’s attention. ✓ In group settings, make sure only one person at a time is talking. ✓ When using an interpreter, speak directly to the person who is Deaf. When the interpreter voices what the person signs, look at the person who is Deaf, not the interpreter. ✓ Speak naturally and clearly, with normal expression and at a normal pace. ✓ Rephrase, rather than repeat if you are not understood. Use fewer words or shorter phrases to clarify if communication is difficult. ✓ When writing back and forth, keep your word choices simple and sentences short. If the person uses more complex sentences and vocabulary, do the same. ✓ Be patient and take time to communicate. Saying “never mind” or “it’s not important” may cause the person with hearing loss to feel that their contribution is not valued. ✓ Services such as TTY/IP Relay Service, VRS (Video Relay Service) are other communication options that empower individuals who are Deaf, Deafened, or Hard of Hearing to communicate with others via technology","th others via technology such as the telephone or cell phones. 1 DON’T: ● Don’t refer to the individual as hearing impaired (outdated and non-inclusive term). Do ask them what they prefer to be identified as - Deaf, Deafened, Hard of Hearing, Deaf-Blind. ● Do not cover your mouth or have anything in your mouth when you are speaking. ● Do not shout. A loud voice may increase distortion or give the impression you are angry, without improving comprehension. ● Do not over-speak to fill in words or finish the person’s thoughts or sentences. Tips for Communicating with a Person who is Deaf-Blind ● People who are deaf-blind have many communication methods and styles. The person who is Deaf-Blind may be accompanied by a Deaf-Blind Support Service Provider (SSP). They will let you know the best way to communicate with them. ● Stand close to the person who is Deaf-Blind. Do not try to communicate from across the room or table. ● Always identify yourself to let the person who is Deaf-Blind know you are there. Approach from the front and then move to the side. This gives the person the opportunity to use any residual central or peripheral vision available. ● A person who is Deaf-Blind may request for or arrange for a Support Service Provider (SSP) to accompany them. The SSP will provide the individual who is Deaf-Blind with information from the environment and will communicate on behalf of the individual. ● Some people who are Deaf-Blind will benefit from large print or Braille materials. Ask which print accommodations are effective. ● Avoid leaving a person who is Deaf-Blind standing in the middle of an open space, or alone in unfamiliar surroundings. Make sure there is somewhere for the person to sit, or something stationary to have contact with, such as a wall or table. 2","No",,,

The award, which was presented last weekend in California, celebrates outstanding work on educational, historical and entertainment projects. The Indigenous Peoples Experience is a transformative experience that came about as a result of years of partnership, cooperation and deeper understanding between all of the Fort Edmonton Park Management Company’s partners, including the Confederacy of Treaty Six First Nations, the Metis Nation of Northern Alberta, City of Edmonton, Elders, knowledge keepers, storytellers, artisans and volunteers. The exhibit is also possible thanks to the support of Hidden Story Productions, Stantec and Clark Builders. The Indigenous Peoples Experience explores the rich cultures of local First Nations and Métis Peoples while encouraging visitors to seek out truths lived by Indigenous Peoples before and after Canada’s founding. It is the first exhibit of its kind in Canada. The success of the exhibit was built on deep conversations with more than 50 Indigenous Elders, historians, educators, and community members who informed the content shared in the exhibit. The stories and artwork come directly from Indigenous perspectives gathered through engagement with over 40 local Indigenous nations, historical documents, and research. Music was written and composed by local, award-winning, Indigenous musicians and performers through an artist residency. Local Indigenous interpreters greet guests and impart their own personal stories and history, adding unique depth to the experience. This shared knowledge does not just exist in the past, it is here today. The Thea Awards were created by the Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) to help realize a key mission of the association: bringing recognition to achievement, talent and personal excellence within the themed entertainment industry. From a modest beginning in 1994, the Thea Awards have become internationally recognized as a symbol of excellence.

Background In 2016, Administration created an advisory group (REAC) that informs the review of City real estate holdings with the intent of providing insight to maximize the value to the City on market development potential of surplus City land. Meetings occurred regularly during the first few years but have become less frequent over time as the work related to the mandate was completed. REAC Membership is made up of individuals from industry and Administration (Appendix A - Membership and Invitees). Over the years Administration has worked with REAC to review city holdings and has obtained non-binding advice from industry relative to the following: ● Approximately 280 properties totalling over 1,000 acres of land and valued at approximately $750M; ● Major City infill development projects such as Station Pointe, The Quarters, River Crossing, Exhibition Lands; ● Plan Whyte and the Old Strathcona Public Places Plan; and ● Enterprise Land Development - industrial and residential land holdings. Administration anticipates new sites to require review in 2025 but the volume will be relatively low (surplus properties from major capital projects like West LRT and Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion). The City Auditor completed an audit of the Real Estate Branch in Q2 2021 and reported that Administration: 1. Is effectively managing City property. 2. Is effectively administering the City’s Land Inventory Database. 1 3. Is effectively and efficiently managing the City’s surplus property holdings. Overall, the audit found that the City’s internal processes related to the review and disposition of surplus or potential surplus properties were effectively and efficiently managed. Feedback from Industry Members Administration obtains feedback from industry through various means, one of which is the City of Edmonton and Industry City Building Partners initiative which leverages shared priorities to build and implement an integrated approach to solving complex development challenges. At the February 24, 2022 City Building Partners meeting, which is composed of the same member organizations as REAC, among other partners, industry members provided the following feedback relative to REAC. ● The current mandate and focus of REAC has been achieved, which has also resulted in some members withdrawing from REAC. ● There is mutual value to industry and Administration in maintaining relationships and industry is prepared to assist Administration in decision making by providing non-binding advice where requested in other formats. ● Industry members are open to the creation of an advisory committee of Council, if that is the will of Council. Next Steps Given the original mandate of REAC has been completed, combined with the audit findings, and feedback from industry, Administration is proceeding to dissolve the Real Estate Advisory Committee. Administration will continue to obtain industry advice through the City Building Partners meeting, by strengthening our partnerships with the commercial real estate brokerage community and continuing to engage with consultants. Where required, targeted and focused working committees with specific mandates and terms will be established.

You may be contacted by constituents and Ci ty staff about some of the comments in the poster and as a result, I am providing you with background information and confirming what Administration's leadership will say publicly if asked. The poster mischaracterizes the City's bargaining approach, offer, and financial position: • It alleges that the City is not bargaining respectfully. Our perspective: There have been multiple productive meetings both at the specific CUPE negotiating table and with union partners collectively. CUP E's comment in relation to the number of meetings is, in our view, an arbitrary establishment of a target for the number of meetings needed to accomplish a task. Further, their criticism of individual Ci ty representatives does not al ign with our respectful workplace initiatives, the Working Relationship Agreement, or the goal of reaching a negotiated settlement. The approach CUPE has chosen is disappointing. • It alleges that the City's offer includes unworkable scheduling arrangements. Our perspective: In fact, the proposal includes solid notice periods, is consistent with the shifts worked by contractors and other comparable 1 municipalities, and was developed to optimize resources and equipment, manage costs and ensure better services for Edmontonians. • It alleges the City's financial situation is strong enough for wage increases. Our perspective: The City is a $3-billion-a-year organization with more than half of its budget devoted to salaries. A list of specific projects the union may disagree with does not constitute an evidence based financial position. Administration is instead looking at our recent financial evaluations, the full budget, economic growth estimates, the broader labour market, the competitiveness of our wage rates, and Edmontonians' appetite for paying additional taxes. Council's mandate for bargaining was developed in light of these considerations. The poster also calls on CUPE members to take action by contacting councillors, supporting coworkers in any job action, and forwarding examples of ""mismanagement"" to CUPE for use in a public campaign. • If employees have concerns about workplace projects or spending, we encourage them to raise their concerns through established internal processes. • There are several projects underway to improve Administration performance, including the program and service review, enterprise performance management, strategic planning, and project management. • With respect to language in the poster about supporting workplace actions, employees whose colleagues are involved in a labour disruption are required to be on the job. If approached by stakeholders or media, Administration spokespeople will respond with messages that are intended to keep the focus on reaching a settlement within the Council-approved mandate: • We are negotiating in good faith at the bargaining table. This means we respect and value both the collective bargaining process and our relationship with our union partners. These are difficult and important conversations, and we believe they should happen at the table, not in the media. • Administration made a fair offer. Like many organizations, the City is facing significant economic challenges. The settlement offer holds the line on wages and reflects our current realities. The offer also includes a proposal to change shift schedules with appropriate notice, so that Edmontonians see better service for snow clearing, storm cleanup, and other outdoor services. • The City has asked for the assistance of a mediator. We believe it is an appropriate time to rely on an independent, third-party mediator to help bring the groups together. We appreciate that the conversations are difficult, and we believe that a neutral outsider can help us work through the process of reaching a common understand ing. We are committed to achieving a negotiated settlement that serves our community, our employees, and their families. 24(1)(a) Kim Armstrong Deputy City Manager Employee Services Attachment(s):CUPE Bargaining Bulletin poster",,"No",,,

To ensure fairness in considering vendor proposals, the Corporate Procurement and Supply Services (CPSS) branch has a detailed evaluation process in place that was revised in November 2021. The Evaluation Plan (Appendix 1) is used for all competitive procurements. The Evaluation Plan provides detailed information regarding the evaluation, negotiation and supplier debrief processes, as well as the involvement required from the Evaluation Committee. It also states that: “The Evaluation Team should not include individuals who report directly to another committee member in their employment. If this is an unavoidable situation, ensure at least one neutral member (who is outside of the employment reporting structure) is on the committee to avoid an employment supervisor imposing their authority over the committee’s decisions and not allowing true consensus decision-making to be achieved”. Before evaluating a proposal, each member of the evaluation committee signs an Evaluation Committee Member Obligations Acknowledgement (Appendix 2) to obtain access to the bids submitted by suppliers. Each evaluation committee has at least three members (number varies depending on scope complexity). Each member of the evaluation committee reviews the bid scores individually. After all members have scored all the qualified bids, the evaluation committee meets to conduct consensus scoring and share their reasons for scoring. In the event of a potential (perceived or real) conflict of interest, the Conflict of Interest of Employees Participating in City Procurements (Appendix 3) procedure is followed. The CPSS team reviews and escalates if necessary. The Branch Manager, CPSS, is the ultimate decision maker to assess the nature of the conflict and to implement mitigation or corrective actions. The City has a variety of processes that are purposefully synchronized with the Procurement Processes. Each City employee must sign the Employee Code of Conduct and when involved in a procurement activity also must sign the acknowledgment mentioned above. The combination of all the processes available provides an appropriate internal control structure in the management of procurement activities. We will continue to monitor opportunities for improvement. Regards, SP/tb",,"Yes","2022-03-18T00:00:00.000","6.8","Audit Committee"

City Policy 618A Councillor’s Budget and Expenses outlines the Common Budget, Ward Budget, Travel Expense Procedures, Accounting Procedures and the review process. The review process identified in the procedure summarizes Councillor’s responsibilities: a. Councillors are responsible for authorizing all expenditures. b. The Manager, Councillors’ Office Liaison Team, Office of the City Clerk, will review all expenses submitted by Councillors to determine that proper documentation is in place and that the expenditure is in compliance with the Councillors’ Budget and Expenses Policy. c. Each Councillor is personally responsible for reimbursing the City for any non-compliant or over-expenditure of the Ward budget. d. The Chair or Vice Chair of Council Services Committee may be asked to provide a final interpretation of this policy with respect to appropriateness of expenses and their allocation. Now that you're settled into your offices and office activities are being initiated, one aspect that you may be less familiar with, if you are new to the City, is how the City recovers costs for discretionary services provided to your offices. These are commonly referred to as intra-municipal services. With regards to potential intra-municipal charges that may impact Councillor Ward budgets, a detailed listing is provided below for future reference. ● Personnel costs include employee payroll, vacation, and staff replacement costs, which could include the use of staff support for short term backfill. ○ Staff support is a discretionary expense at the request of the Councillor’s Office. ■ Authorization of the expense is done at the time of request. Intra-municipal charges will be applied to ward budgets for these service requests. Payment for work performed by non-City employees are paid via a submitted invoice. ● Expenses related to community events include City facility site bookings and purchases of City provided items or services. Authorization is done in advance and ward office staff would work with the relevant City business area for the service or item, receive a costing /quote and obtain their Councillor’s approval prior to proceeding with arrangements. Note: The Councillors’ Budget and Expenses Policy C618A and Reserving City Facilities Policy 1474 provide further considerations when booking City facilities as it pertains to the use of City space and elected officials and/or political activities. ● Expenses for ward-wide mail outs: includes contract fees for mail-outs as well as postage. Ward office staff would make these arrangements with their Councillor’s approval in advance of the mailing. Approval of the postage is considered to be the delivery to the mailroom, and Ward budgets will be charged accordingly. Alternatively, Ward office staff may also wish to work directly with Canada Post to price out the postage and discuss service offerings. ● Charges for items purchased on Corporate Credit Cards: Ward office staff would seek approval from the Councillor prior to ordering or making arrangements (i.e. catering for a meeting, conference registration fees, monthly transit pass for Ward Office staff, online purchases, etc.). ● Monthly cell phone charges for Councillor’s staff: Authorization for cell phones for work purposes are subject to the Councillor’s approval. Monthly usage fees are charged monthly to Ward budgets. Copies of the usage bill may be provided to the Councillor through communication to their Telecommunications Coordinator. Also, each employee receives a report on their usage through the telecom expense management system (Cimpl). These reports could be forwarded to the Councillor for review and approval if preferred. ● City-led training: Staff enrollment is subject to approval of the Councillor. Some internal training has associated costs, and Councillors should be made aware of related charges. Ward office staff would provide the Councillor with the costing de","Councillor with the costing details prior to approval. In addition to impacts to Councillor Ward budgets, the following intra-municipal charges may impact the Councillor Common Budget: ● Personnel costs: includes Councillors’ compensation and employment benefits for everyone in the Office of the Councillors. ● Materials and equipment: includes leasing / usage charges for office equipment such as photocopying machines. ● General office repairs: includes general office upkeep and maintenance. Discretionary requests such as office space reorientation, hanging pictures, whiteboards, etc. is at the request of the Councillor’s Office. Intra-municipal charges will be applied to Ward budgets for these service requests. ● Employer-provided monthly parking stalls: for City Council members and Councillors’ Executive Assistant staff stalls at City Hall. Monthly intra-municipal charges are applied for these expenses. ● Telecommunications charges: these pertain to all office landlines and all Councillors’ cell phone usage. As you can see from the above scenarios, Councillors' staff play an important role in coordinating purchases for your Ward Offices. Per Council Policy C608, Human Resources Management for Council staff, these staff are accountable to their Councillor for the performance of their duties and responsibilities and must be familiar with City Policy C618A Councillors' Budget and Expenses, working closely with their Councillor to obtain all necessary approvals as described above.

Between 2018 to 2020, there were 13 IT contracts with a value of $1,054,680.88, filled outside of the Corporate IT staff augmentation contract within the Open City and Technology Branch. Regarding the number of contractors paid below the rate card, Administration reviewed all 41 IT contracted resources hired through the staff augmentation contracts (Randstad and Flextrack) between 2018 and 2020. In 15 cases, the rate did not match the rate schedule. In 13 cases, rates were paid higher than the rate card, and in 2 cases, paid rates were lower. Cases when the rate card was exceeded reflect occasional needs for rare and specialized skills for which the defined rate cards either did not contemplate the roles, or, the market rates were materially different. Potential for an overall cost-benefit analysis of these contracts was also raised at Committee; this type of analysis was not completed as part of the audit. The majority of contractor use is for specialized skill-sets that the City does not have a sustained need for (e.g. moving of data centres; advanced technical skills related to a one-time setup of complex technologies that are only purchased once in a multi-year period, etc.). The average duration of an IT service contract is 7.5 months. Due to the complex projects and evolving IT skills required for this specialized work, contractors would inevitably be required, regardless of the number of permanent employees brought on to do this work. Given the unique needs of these types of contracts, cost-benefit is embedded in the decision-making process, and is done on a case-by-case basis. Administration compares what it would cost to employ an individual or contract services for each specific specialized (and often sought after) skill. The immediacy of the need for the skillset is also a factor, given hiring staff generally takes more time. The City requires various IT skills to sustain a complex digital environment, but some are only required on a temporary basis. When considering the costs and benefits of hiring versus contracting, Administration takes into account the duration of the skills required, and overhead costs such as benefits, real estate, sick time, or training, all of which are not part of the City’s responsibility to contractors.

We recently mailed a postcard to all residents in Edmonton and, today, we’re excited to release our first safety video. It’s a great snapshot of the new system, and how it differs from the existing Capital Line and Metro Line. The safety video has just been published on the City’s Youtube channel, and the City will be sharing it on social media later today. Over the coming weeks, you will also start to notice billboards, bus shelters ads and digital ads popping up for the Valley Line Southeast. The campaign headline is: SEE TRACKS. EXPECT A TRAIN. Below are some messages to aid you in responding to any general questions or postings on social media: ● Valley Line Southeast (VLSE) will be a significant addition to our City’s integrated transit network. ● Edmontonians will continue to see trains along the tracks between Mill Woods and downtown as TransEd, the contractor responsible for designing and building the VLSE, continues to test trains. ● We will continue to work with TransEd to have the line open for safe, reliable service as soon as possible. That continues to be the primary goal. If asked about the delay in service commencement: ● Edmontonians’ investment is protected through our fixed-price contract with TransEd and helps ensure we receive good value for tax dollars. ● TransEd is feeling the financial consequences of the delay. 1 Valley Line Southeast is different from the existing Capital Line and Metro Line. Some of the main differences are: ● VLSE trains share the road with motorists. ● VLSE is designed to fit into our communities, so there are no crossing arms, gates or bells at intersections - this is common in many cities. ● VLSE trains are low-floor trains, so passengers will board at sidewalk-level (rather than on a higher platform like the Capital Line and Metro Line). ● VLSE stops are smaller and closer together along the alignment.

The inventory includes assets such as roads, bridges, park space and amenities, fleet, facilities, technology, streetlights and many others. The report captures a count of assets, the approximate replacement value and the condition of assets (see edmonton.ca/infrastructure). This base information is used as input into the prioritization of the 4-year capital renewal programs and supports the long-term goals outlined in the City’s Infrastructure Asset Management Policy (C598) and Strategy. Per the attached 2021 Infrastructure State and Condition report, the City of Edmonton’s assets are currently valued at approximately $31 billion. The City’s existing assets remain in good to very good condition in the vast majority of asset classes, with 52.2% in Good and Very Good condition, 38.7% in Fair condition and 9.1% in Poor or Very Poor condition. The City has a robust renewal program to manage the state and condition of its assets. Within the 2019-2022 Capital Budget, the City has allocated approximately $1.7 billion, across nearly 30 different funding envelopes to help maintain the overall asset condition.

The City of Edmonton has started design work on a new park in downtown Edmonton, Warehouse Park, to meet the needs of a growing population. The vision for this park is an urban oasis and an inclusive, multi-use green space featuring large, open areas that invite citizens and visitors to reflect and explore. This park will serve as a major public amenity for downtown residents, workers and visitors as the downtown population is expected to significantly increase in the next decade. We are planning to break ground on the new park in 2024 with an opening date in late 2025. Communication about the project will be ongoing and will include two rounds of public engagement: the first during concept design and the second during preliminary design. Concept phase public engagement will begin on May 2 and the survey will be open until May 22. The survey will be promoted on the website, advertised on social media, digital display boards, on-site signage, flyers and postcards will be delivered in the area. Engagement activities will include stakeholder meetings, visits to surrounding businesses, in-person pop-up engagement opportunities downtown, and an online public event. Details of the online public event are as follows: Date: Tuesday, May 10, 2022 Time: 6:30pm -7:30pm Location: Virtual - please visit edmonton.ca/warehousepark The online public event will include a presentation that will provide an overview of the design process and concept options, including fly-through perspectives. The design consultants, gh3* Architecture and Claude Cormier + Associés along with City staff, will be available to answer questions.

The platform has authentic Edmonton content including downloadable, free photos, video, stories and facts that anyone can use to talk about and promote our city. The goals of the platform are to: 1. Equip partners with Edmonton content that can help them connect with their audiences and support their individual goals. These partners all have a role in making Edmonton a vibrant, prosperous and livable place, including: economic development agencies, post-secondary institutions, arts and culture organizations, business community, non-profits, etc. 2. Build awareness and pride in Edmontonians to inspire them to become ambassadors and share Edmonton stories with each other and, in the longer term, friends and family outside of Edmonton. The platform delivers on two strategies in the Place Brand Strategy (action 19 of the Economic Action Plan): 6.1. Profile Edmonton people, businesses, innovations and organizations and 6.2. Develop a library of brand assets. Over the next three months, during the launch phase, 30+ stories will be published on Why.edmonton.ca. After the launch phase, new content will be published frequently to continue to profile Edmonton and Edmotnonians. As we move into the next phase of the project there will be further collaboration with partners and new features and content themes added to the site. This is an answer to one of the questions you’ve asked us recently: “how can we get the good news out about Edmonton?”. Our goal isn’t to monopolize the Edmonton story; it's to amplify it. Multiple organizations sharing diverse perspectives will help share the more complete and authentic Edmonton story. We hope that Council will take the opportunity to explore the site, visit often and share the many stories that capture what, and who, makes this place uniquely Edmonton.

CURRENT ACTIONS (Immediate) 1. That a Notice of Intention to Designate a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1, be served on the owners of the property located at 6018 - 111 Avenue NW in accordance with Section 26 of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9. 1 2. That the City Manager be appointed to implement matters arising from the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Designate the Carleton Sheldon Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1. FUTURE ACTIONS (At least 60 days after the Notice of Intention to Designate is served) 1. Pursuant to the provisions of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9, a Bylaw to Designate the Carleton Sheldon Residence as Municipal Historic Resource (the “Bylaw”) will be brought forward to Council for their consideration. 1 On November 26, 2019, City Council passed amendments to the City Administration Bylaw, delegating approval of Notices of Intention to Designate (NOI) under the Historical Resources Act (HRA) to the City Manager, where the owner consents to the designation of their property. The NOI initiates the designation process under the Historical Resources Act ; the final decision on designation remains with City Council by way of a bylaw. 1 2. If approved, the Bylaw and corresponding Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will contemplate funding of up to $97,130.72 to be provided from the Heritage Resources Reserve to fund City-funded work on the Carleton Sheldon Residence, as described in Attachment 5. BACKGROUND The Carleton Sheldon Residence is on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton, and merits designation under City Policy C450B - Policy to Encourage the Designation and Rehabilitation of Municipal Historic Resources in Edmonton. The building was constructed in 1914 in the Highlands neighbourhood, and features Craftsman style influences. On March 21, 2022, the owners completed the application requirements to have the Carleton Sheldon Residence, located at 6018 - 111 Avenue NW designated as a Municipal Historic Resource under the provisions of City Policy C450B. If designated, any future renovation of the Carleton Sheldon Residence will be required to meet the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the Heritage Resources Reserve will pay the owner up to $97,130.72 for rehabilitation over a three year term. The current Reserve balance is sufficient to cover the committed funding, including the Carleton Sheldon Residence. In 2022, the Historic Resource Management program increased the available rehabilitation grant funding at the time of designation for residential properties for up to 50 per cent of eligible work to a maximum matching grant of $100,000. The former amount, up to a $75,000 matching grant, was established in 2009. In recent years, nearly all residential designations have maximized the available rehabilitation grant. Labour and materials costs continue to increase, so it was determined that an increase to the maximum grant was needed to continue to act as an incentive for designation. The total estimated cost of the restoration work for the Carleton Sheldon Residence is $194,261.44. Beyond the $97,130.72 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, the owner is responsible for all costs of the restoration work for the project. After considering the funds committed to date, the Heritage Resource Reserve is projected to have a balance of $4,092,105 at the end of 2022, declining to $1,803,600 by the end of 2023 as of March 31, 2022. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. During this period, the Heritage Resource Re","serve is funded 2 by the tax levy on an annual basis ($2,328,584 in 2022 including $417,550 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd). PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT Public engagement was not undertaken as part of this process, as it is not required under the Historical Resources Act . c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Michelle Plouffe, City Solicitor, Legal Services Attachments: 1.

The CEIP is designed to accelerate investment in the environmental resiliency of buildings as part of Edmonton’s Community Energy Transition Strategy and Action Plan. The residential stream launched on March 29. A commercial stream will roll out later in 2022. The program provides a total of $11.25 million in financing and rebates for both streams to address most upfront costs. The financing is then repaid by the property owners through the owners’ property taxes. The Residential launch on March 29 experienced immediate and overwhelming interest by property owners. The Pre-qualification portal was closed to new submissions on April 1. Submissions sought higher than expected retrofit financing at an average of $35,000/residence (well over the anticipated $15,000/residence). This resulted in the planned funding being fully allocated and a waitlist started. A total of 127 pre-qualification files were received by the closure on April 1. The City received a $9.69-million loan from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) Green Municipal Fund to develop and launch the pilot programs. The balance of the $11.25M budget ($1.56M) is from stacked rebates via several City of Edmonton incentive programs including, Home Energy Retrofit Accelerator (HERA), Solar Rebate Program and Buildings Energy Retrofits Accelerator (BERA). Alberta Municipalities is administering the pilot program over its two-year duration. As a result of this unprecedented interest in this funding, we are redistributing funding between the two streams. The redistribution increases the residential stream to $2.8M (increase from the original $1.25M). This will allow for the original target sample of 80 homes ($35,000 x 80 homes). The diverted funds will be allocated to approved waitlisted applicants in the order in which they were received. Depending on the commercial average upgrade valuation (forecast at $500,000/project), the remaining $8.45M still allows for a reasonable sample of commercial projects. Next steps for the Residential Program ● Pre-qualifications are under review by Alberta Municipalities in the order that they were received. Pre-qualification submissions which meet eligibility will be invited to submit a full Application with a three-month deadline. ● Once reviewed, Applications will be forwarded to COE for review and rebate calculation/fund reservation. ● Upon Application approval, initial financing agreements are executed and applicants have six months to complete their upgrades. ● Once upgrades are confirmed complete, financing agreements will be finalized. ● Financing is entered manually on to each property tax bill with one line item per upgrade and a corresponding term/duration for repayment. ● Alberta Municipalities will manage the 80 file target and move as far into the waitlist as necessary. Next steps for Commercial Program ● Finalize Terms and Conditions with Alberta Municipalities ● Finalize agreement templates ● Finalize eligibility list for upgrades ● Target launch date May 31 The CEIP team has begun preparing the summary report for the pilot program finding and exploring options to scale the program. Interim and a final report will provide include recommendations regarding options for a permanent program and reference: ● Timeline options ● Cost estimates ● Funding source(s) ● GHG impacts ● Recommended updates to the Regulation.

The City remains committed to working proactively and collaboratively to increase the supply of affordable housing in all areas of the city. The City's primary role is as a limited funding partner, using City land and capital grants to leverage additional funding from partners such as other orders of government. Because the City’s priority is to incentivize the supply of affordable housing rather than construct and operate it, the City tends to be supportive and flexible regardless of built form. This approach has meant that the City remains open to alternative forms of housing types whenever appropriate and allowed by the zoning. This priority of remaining supportive and flexible to affordable housing proposals can be seen in recent changes to how the City approaches land sales to affordable housing providers. In 2021, Administration recommended amendments to Policy C437 - The Lease or Sale of City-Owned Land for Social Housing Development and proposed revisions to the City’s Land Management Guidelines (CS00211). These amendments facilitated the sale or lease of City-owned land to not-for-profit organizations for the purpose of affordable housing development at less than market value, without requiring individual approval from Council or its Committees. The Social Development and Real Estate, Financial and Corporate Services areas report back to City Council on under-market sales completed from previously approved sites as part of the annual affordable housing update. Eligible affordable housing developments can take a wide variety of forms; mixed-income housing, rent geared to income, supportive housing, or affordable homeownership. In terms of built form, the City is open to any proposals subject to the approved land use zoning. The policy amendments created a process for identifying a batch of suitable City-owned sites and seeking approval of less than market value sales or leases to non-profit housing providers approximately once per year. This process is consistent, transparent, and creates predictable land dispositions for affordable housing development that align with the City Auditor's recommendations. ../ 3 - 2 - As a result of the willingness and tendency to be flexible around built form, the City has supported a wide range of alternative housing types when proposed. Various examples are provided below. Tiny Homes/Villages During the March 4, 2019 Executive Committee, Council approved a ground lease agreement between the City of Edmonton and the Homes for Heroes Foundation (CR_6794). Homes for Heroes Foundation, in partnership with the City of Edmonton and other social agencies, developed a tiny home community to provide 18 to 25 affordable housing units for veterans experiencing homelessness in Edmonton. This project provides supportive housing for veterans facing a range of health issues including post-traumatic stress disorder and physical and cognitive disabilities. The Village officially opened on November 25, 2021 with 20 tiny homes. The lease of civic property for a nominal rate ($1 per year) continues to be a successful incentive for projects such as this. Co-operatives Similar to the tiny homes projects, the City has land leases with seven cooperatives in the City at a nominal rate. The last land lease that was before Council was the Homestead Co-operative where they were seeking a Landlease Extension (March 1, 2021 Executive Committee CS00076). This request was for a 60-year extension to their existing land lease with the City of Edmonton. The extension was approved and enabled the Co-operative to access federal funding and financing to complete a long-term renovation plan on the 34 affordable housing units they operate. Leveraging civic property is a tool Administration often uses when approached with these requests. Co-location Developments with Civic Services There are currently several developments that co-locate different Civic Services in the city, such as the Millwoods Town Centre P","ublic Library and Millwoods Senior and Multicultural Centre or Clareview Community Recreation Centre, Clareview Public Library, and Cardinal Collins High School Academic Centre. However, there has yet to be any development that integrates housing along with civic services. City Administration is currently exploring an opportunity to co-locate supportive housing above a firehall. Examples of Fire Hall and Affordable Housing co-located developments exist in different North American municipalities. Administration is exploring this option, hoping to learn from examples and to find more opportunities for future co-location developments that include affordable or supportive housing. Secondary Suites The City of Edmonton’s Secondary Suites Grant was designed to increase the supply of affordable housing by providing property owners with funding to help build new suites or upgrade existing suites. Property owners were required to rent the suites to eligible low-income tenants. The program was successful, with grants contributing to the construction or renovation of 354 suites for low-income tenants between 2017 and 2020. Amendments to the Zoning Bylaw have made it easier for homeowners to build secondary suites, leading to a significant increase in secondary suite developments. Because of the - 3 - increase in secondary suite development and the high level of uptake of the program, available grant funding has now been fully allocated and the program has ended. Modular-built As part of the first round of Rapid Housing Initiative funding from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation in 2020, the City has managed the design and construction of five permanent supportive housing sites that utilize modular construction techniques, the first the City has ever done. The City took an active role in these projects to support Homeward Trust’s efforts to leverage federal support for much-needed permanent supportive housing. Homeward Trust will ultimately own and manage these properties, selecting operators for each facility. This methodology used the opportunity to pre-fabricate residential units off-site while constructing the foundation and managing the permitting process, so that units can be added quickly. Commercial Conversion to Residential As part of the second round of Rapid Housing Initiative, the City has partnered with housing providers to acquire existing hotels and convert them to self-contained, permanent supportive housing units. Like the modular construction of the previous round, the City’s priority was to support the rapid addition of highly needed permanent supportive housing units. Three hotels are currently in development. This includes Prairie Manor (The Mustard Seed’s project at the former Days Inn at University Ave), the Sands Hotel (NiGiNan Housing Ventures), and Coliseum Inn (Homeward Trust). The conversion of existing hotels leverages underutilized assets to achieve goals faster and potentially cheaper than a new construction. Other North American jurisdictions have converted other commercial uses to residential uses to affordable housing as well, like office towers, which could be explored in the future.

The City of Edmonton provides a variety of recreation programming to meet the diverse needs of the community and ensure equitable access to Edmontonians regardless of age, gender, identity, ability, family status, ethnicity, race, religion or income level. City-run recreation programming is determined through an annual planning process in alignment with community needs, strategic frameworks (like ConnectEdmonton and The City Plan), Council priorities and existing City policies. This planning results in a range of program offerings and, whenever heightened expertise is required to support the needs of specialized groups or underserved populations, the City may facilitate delivery of these programs through partnerships. Specialized recreation programming and accommodations with an equity lens targeted to the needs of diverse groups are offered at various City facilities and open spaces including Attractions, specialty facilities, parks, recreation and leisure centres. Attractions, arts, and specialized facilities primarily utilize immersive experiences to enrich visitors through an inclusive, integrated, and accommodation-based approach. Upon request, programs can be customized to meet specialized group needs. The parks and recreation facilities focus on a LIVE ACTIVE lens modifying activities to accommodate individuals with cognitive or physical limitations. A list of specialized recreation programming and accommodations currently offered by the City is summarized below: ● Virtual fitness, arts and education programs. ● Adaptive fitness equipment at Clareview Community Recreation Centre. ../ 3 - 2 - ● Water Works, a drop in aquatic exercise program specifically for people with muscle, joint, or mobility problems. ● Accessible communication services one year pilot (American Sign Language, Interpreters, Real Time Captioning equipment). ● Persons With Disabilities (PWD) - registered and drop-in programs. ● Dreamnight at the Edmonton Valley Zoo - free event for chronically ill children. ● Edmonton Valley Zoo partnership with Edmonton Catholic Schools 100 Voices program supporting kids with learning challenges. ● Health access partnership with the Primary Care Network (PCN) to provide community-based supervised exercise programs. ● Sensory kits for Zoo visitors who may have sensory stimulation sensitivities. ● You Can Ride 2, an adaptive biking program at the Zoo for children with disabilities and their families to promote an active lifestyle. ● Mobility scooters, wheelchairs, wagons and strollers for rent at the Zoo. ● Wheelchair rentals at Muttart Conservatory. ● John Janzen Nature Centre indoor playground, designed for wheelchair accessibility for 90 per cent of play elements. ● Leisure Access Pass Program, for people with low income. ● Women on Weights (WOW) program to provide direction and confidence to women in a traditional weight room setting focusing on proper technique. ● For Girls By Girls (FGBG) sport program for girls aged 9-15 to help them gain sport skills in a positive, safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment with like-minded girls. ● Youth In Action (YIA) fitness orientations. ● Free drop-in outdoor playground programs for children (Green Shacks, Play Rangers). ● Women only swims. ● Downtown Community Arena partnership, offering Can Skate and Sledge Hockey for downtown schools meeting low income/high needs criteria. In addition, specialized requests for access to sport facilities are viewed through an accessibility lens. Although there are requirements around sport facility allocation, the City recognizes that additional challenges are posed to groups with specific accessibility needs. Because of this, facilities that can provide enhanced accessibility options are prioritized for the groups requiring these amenities. For example: ● Edmonton Adaptive Sledge Hockey has been provided with weekly arena rental time at The Meadows Arena, a facility that is designe","d with the purpose of supporting Sledge Hockey programs. ● Special Olympics has historically been provided advanced access to facilities best suited for their programming. ● Use of City gymnasiums is encouraged for wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, and related sports. - 3 - JF/rj c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Roger Jevne, Branch Manager, Community Recreation and Culture Encl.: Accessibility for People with Disabilities | City of Edmonton Pilot Project for Accessible Communication Services in Registered Recreation Programs Leisure Access Program (LAP) )","No",,,

Parks and Roads Services will be installing mobile washrooms around the city and Edmonton Transit Service will take a phased approach to reopening transit washroom facilities to the public. Parks and Roads Services - Mobile Washroom Project In anticipation of increased outdoor activities during the summer months of 2022, Parks and Roads Services will expand access to public washrooms with up to 12 mobile washroom trailers, which will be located around the city (see list below). Placement of these washrooms will start today, May 2, and they will be on-site until October 31, 2022. These washrooms will be staffed with attendants who will oversee their use and maintenance to ensure a positive user experience for both residents and visitors to the City. Mobile Washroom Locations: ● Alberta Avenue Community League ● Lauderdale Offleash Park ● Warehouse Park site ● Kinistinaw Park ● Outside the premises of Boyle Street Community Services (10116 - 105 Ave. NW, Edmonton, AB) ● Jasper Place Transit Station/Butler Memorial Park ● Remaining six locations are still being discussed with relevant stakeholders (TBA) The announcement of additional washrooms throughout our city is anticipated by a number of businesses, community partners, equity seeking groups and the public who have been advocating for more access to cleaner and safer washrooms. …/2 -3- If there are further questions regarding the Mobile Washroom Project, please contact Craig McKeown, Branch Manager, Parks and Roads Services at Craig.McKeown@edmonton.ca . Edmonton Transit Service - Reopening Transit Washrooms Concurrently, Edmonton Transit Service is set to reopen select public washrooms within transit centres and LRT stations on May 2 using a phased approach which provides ETS the opportunity to test new measures, refine and adjust as needed before reopening the remainder of the washrooms. The temporary transit washroom closures were part of the Transit Safety and Security Plan, approved by Council in February. Effective May 2, ETS will be reopening 10 of the 18 transit washrooms in this initial phase to help ensure safe, clean access to transit washrooms. The locations are: ● Northgate ● South Campus ● Kingsway ● Castle Downs ● Meadows ● Lewis Farms ● Heritage Valley ● Clareview ● Southgate ● Central * washroom attendant at this location for additional support To support this plan, ETS will implement increased security oversight and wellness checks; enhanced cleaning; signage indicating how to report unclean or unsafe washrooms; signage on overdose prevention strategies, emergency support and treatment services; and, sharps containers for safer needle disposal in all transit washrooms by the end of May. In addition, a washroom attendant will be provided at the Central LRT station once training is complete. Observations, data and key learnings will help to inform the timing and approach for opening the remainder of the washrooms. Security guards have been trained and supplied with naloxone to supplement the efforts of Transit Peace Officers and other emergency support personnel. ETS is also in the process of providing naloxone kits and training for Transit Inspectors. Further, ETS is investigating safety improvements that can be implemented over the medium to long term, such as motion detection and design adjustments to the washrooms to increase safety. For further questions about plans to support the safe reopening of washrooms on transit, contact Carrie Hotton-MacDonald, Branch Manager, Edmonton Transit Service at carrie.hotton-macdonald@edmonton.ca . …/3 -3- Communications Approach Administration will proactively hold a virtual media availability this afternoon, May 2, and distribute a news release to share messages on both of these programs and demonstrate the City’s commitment to continual improvement and providing safe, clean access to public washroom facilities. Updates will also be made to edmonton.ca/washrooms , as well as social media posts focused on the rollout of the mobile washrooms across the city. Highlighting these two washroom plans demonstrates the Cit","the City’s commitment to continual improvement to help positively impact the lives of Edmontonians. Work planned as part of the Washroom Strategy this year also includes defining a governance structure for public washrooms citywide, including processes for closing and reopening washrooms.

Highlights to Changes in the Most Recent SNIC Policy Update Council approved the SNIC Policy Refresh (C409K) in August, 2021. Below is a high-level overview of the changes that occurred from the previous policy (C409J): ● Operational content was moved from the policy to a new SNIC Procedure document. ● Updates were made to reflect clearer language, descriptions and definitions, and content was organized into additional sections. ● The two-phase parking ban was updated (previously the seasonal parking ban) ● The Active Pathways and Roadways service levels were clearly separated. ● Minor additions were made to service levels for Roadways (business district alleys, rural roads) and changes to blading timelines for residential roads. ● Changes were made to service levels for Active Pathways, specifically adding sandboxes and manually cleared areas to Priority 3 service levels Performance Management Framework and Benchmarking The 2021 Snow and Ice Audit Report recommended that Administration develop and implement a performance management framework (recommendation 4) and improve and formalize a benchmarking process (recommendation 5). These recommendations were completed and closed by the Office of the City Auditor. Administration developed and implemented a comprehensive performance management (KPI) framework and reporting structure, building on SNIC existing metrics and measures: ● % complete by priority (by priority levels and weighted average) ● Average processing time for 311 notifications ● Expenditure tracking (in SAP) ● Safety measures (through OH&S) …/2 -2- ● Total percentage of inventory cleared after a snow event (as specified by service level agreement or SLA in the snow and ice policy) by weighted average of all inventory priorities (P1, P2 & P3 routes). In conjunction with Recommendation 4, Administration developed a benchmarking process, to be conducted annually with seven other Canadian municipalities. Some examples of benchmarking measures are: ● Service level standards and level of compliance with meeting those standards ● Total area serviced by km² (for Roadways) and by m² (for Active Pathways such as sidewalks and dedicated bike lanes) ● Overall cost per km² (all Roads) and cost per m² (all Active Pathways such as sidewalks, bike lanes, etc.) ● Percent (%) of total budget that is spent on contracted services and hired equipment ● Total amount and type of abrasives used Administration reviews program expenditures and performance measures on a monthly basis as a part of prudent oversight of operations. The SNIC benchmarking developed in response to the audit will continue until a corporate benchmarking framework is established. Work is underway to complete a corporate benchmarking framework. Summary of Amounts Spent on SNIC Contract Work Below is a 2018 to 2021 summary of SNIC contract spending compared with total spending. 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total SNIC Budget $60.6M $58.8M $57.5M $55.5M Actuals $63.1M $54.0M $60.7M $44.3M Contracted Budget $5.3M $9.4M $10.1M $10.5M Actuals $8.3M $7.8M $7.2M $3.1M Administration is tracking lessons learned from existing contracts for future opportunities, such as improving equipment tracking and payment processes, adjusting contracts to support addition of new equipment dynamically and identifying corporate barriers for contractors (eg. electronic remittance systems and insurance certificate requirements). …/3 -3- Factors Contributing to Reduced Utilization of SNIC Equipment Staff availability was the most significant contributing factor to SNIC equipment utilization of approximately 57% during the 2021-22 winter season. ● Staff availability : In the 2021-22 winter season, there were not enough staff to fully utilize all available equipment for roadways. Underutilization of Active Pathways equipment was due in part to a training bottleneck for experienced operators. Operations is considering how to mitigate this bottleneck in future seasons. ● Contracted services and hired equipment: Equipment used by contractors is addition","rs is additional to the 130 pieces of equipment outlined in the Council report, and is not a contributing factor towards current equipment utilization. ● Equipment lifespan and availability: The average fleet availability in the 2021-22 winter season ranged from 72 per cent to 79 per cent, depending on the piece of equipment. Equipment utilization fluctuates year-over-year in response to weather conditions, from number and size of snow events to changes in service level expectations. Administration reviewed equipment life cycles in response to a recommendation as a part of the SNIC Audit. Types of equipment used (both owned and contracted) are informed by feedback from SNIC operators. Current lifecycles for main types of equipment are: ○ 10-11 years for sander trucks (average age of fleet is 5.9 years) ○ 6 years for sidewalk tractors and toolcats (average age of fleet is 3.4 and 4.3 yrs, respectively) Cost Breakdown of a Single Residential Blading and Windrow Removal The following information outlines a full cost breakdown of one complete residential blading cycle, including cul-de-sacs, to bare pavement and removal of windrows. Task Cost Blading roads and alleys $13.1M Full windrow removal* $35.7M Blading and hauling culs-de-sacs (including snow disposal) $14.8M Total Cost $63.6M (2.2% tax increase) * The cost estimate to remove windrows is based on the volume of snow. If windrows are only removed once in a winter season, it is anticipated that the volume of snow would be higher than if windrows were removed several times throughout the season. It should be noted that the City does not currently have the capacity for additional snow storage. A decision to remove all windrows would require additional space (and budget) to create, maintain and monitor additional snow storage sites. …/4 -4- Breakdown of SNIC Budget Impacts from 2018 to 2022 From 2018 to 2022, the SNIC budget was reduced by approximately $8M from $65M to $57M. The major contributing factors were: ● $4.4M Traffic Safety and Automated Enforcement Reserve (TSAER) Funding Reduction annually of $1.1M from 2019-2022 ● $1.5M budget reduction targets/efficiencies in 2019 as part of the 2019-2022 budget cycle review ● $1.1M budget reductions in workforce efficiencies in 2020 ● $1M accumulated reorganization internal impacts (mainly reallocations between Infrastructure Operations/Infrastructure Maintenance) in 2020 Infrastructure Impacts of Pooling Water The City does not currently have specific data regarding the impacts of pooling water and ice formation. Generally, pooling water can accelerate the deterioration of roads and sidewalks, resulting in a reduced service life of these assets and increased cost of road maintenance and rehabilitation. Deterioration may take weeks, months or even years to trigger maintenance or rehabilitation of the asset. Therefore, it may be difficult to confirm the extent of repairs required directly as a result of pooling water. Staff Retention Rates Retention rate trends for employees fluctuate year to year. SNIC employee data suggests that there is internal movement of staff within programs and the branch, and that staff may be interested in seeking related positions and opportunities. Permanent employees have a 95 per cent retention across the corporation. % Retention (same SNIC role) % Retention (any SNIC role) % Retention (within PARS) Temporary Permanent Temporary Permanent Temporary Permanent 2020-21 season 66.5% 79.2% 75.4% 86.9% 81.8% 96.2% 2021-22 season 59.0% 81.2% 70.7% 80.5% 73.9% 89.5% Turnover represents the percentage of employees who left the organization, voluntarily or involuntarily. In 2021, Parks and Roads Services had a 6% turnover rate of permanent staff, compared to the City of Edmonton average of 6.2%. Service Standards for Windrow-free Zones Adjacent to Schools The purpose of windrow-free zones around schools is to provide parents, buses, etc. with unobstructed curbside access on the school side of the street in which to safely drop off and pick up children. …/5 -5- This also helps minimize the number of children needing to cross the street during busy hours around schools. Windrow-free zones are are directly in front of the school (drop off zone) and do not extend across the street or around the school. When streets around schools are cleared , snow from both sides of the street is moved to the opposite side of the street across from the windrow free zone in front of the school. The resulting windrows across from the school are picked up 1-2 times per season based on factors such as windrow size, impacted parking areas, sightlines, current and forecasted weather. CUPE Local 30 Summary Report Administration has reviewed the report provided by CUPE Local 30. The concerns about staffing and equipment resources are similar to the feedback Administration received as a part of internal engagement, which informed the options in the report. Some concerns are also being addressed through the Snow and Ice Audit recommendations, as well as corporate projects: ● Administration is evaluating the seasonal workforce complement at both a corporate and branch level to better align staffing and hiring practices with operational needs, which may include opportunities for permanent staff to perform year-round work. ● Parks and Roads Services is working with Fleet and Facility Services and vendors for leased equipment to establish service level agreement to increase equipment availability. This work includes determining optimal life cycles of commonly used equipment. ● Regarding staff scheduling, supplemental work and equipment availability, options R1 and AP1 would greatly reduce the requirement for overtime, shifting the burden away from employees to work extra hours and allowing Administration to maximize equipment use, such as grouping grader operators. Operationally, work is underway to proceed with continuous improvements: ● A new contract for sand has been signed and was implemented partway through the 2021-22 season to provide availability for all uses, which should resolve availability concerns. Approximately twice as much sand was used this year (53.4 tonnes) compared with the last season (27 tonnes) due to road and walkway conditions. ● Overall salt use has been decreasing since 2018-19. ● A new facility at Ambleside will help reduce deployment times, but will take time to build. The integrated Ellerslie facility will help support operations in the SW while Ambleside is being built. The most recent updates to district boundaries was the alignment of Active Pathways and Roadways borders in 2019. Administration is continuously looking for opportunities to deploy staff in an effective and efficient manner. …/6 -6- Administration welcomes feedback from all employees and is committed to continuous improvement. Management and supervisors will continue to involve operational staff in work plans, routing, and other opportunities to improve the SNIC program. Next Steps Upon receiving direction from Council on May 2, 2022, Administration will return to Community and Public Services Committee in June with a programmed approach for the upcoming Snow and Ice Control season. Administration will also assess during the upcoming 2022/23 winter season and return to measure the results and work with Council to make iterative changes to the program.

VISION ZERO BY THE NUMBERS - KEY STATS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT ● Since adopting Vision Zero in 2015, crash-caused fatalities have decreased by 50%, serious injuries have decreased by 32%, and pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries have decreased by 27%. Community Activation ● In the first year of Community Activation programs: 18 community groups began planning their Vision Zero Street Lab, five Vision Zero Street Labs were implemented on street, 3,541 community signs were delivered to Edmontonians as part of the Safe Speeds Toolkit, 233 portable DFS signs (speed trailers) were deployed (honouring 315 citizen requests), and 31 schools participated in activities using the Vision Zero School Kit. Safe Crossings ● In 2021, 48 crossings and 49 schools were upgraded to support safer travel for all. 40 km/h Speed Limit Reduction ● After four months of implementation, automated enforcement data shows that the percentage of drivers complying with the new speed limit along 40 km/h streets rose steadily until it reached 88% in December. People are complying with the new, safer speed limit in residential and high pedestrian areas. ● Portable driver feedback signs","er feedback signs (speed trailers) were used at 233 locations in Edmonton of which 35 locations were selected to support the new 40 km/h speed limit. Mobile Speed Enforcement ● Total crashes at mobile enforcement sites have been decreasing since the City adopted Vision Zero in 2015. From pre-Vision Zero (2013-2015) averages to the 2016-2019 averages there was a reduction of 18% in crashes. When comparing 2021 with 2019 (pre-pandemic), there was a further reduction of 20%, indicating an overall consistent reduction trend in collision numbers. ● Between 2019 and 2021, the percentage of drivers who received a ticket decreased by 63%. ● The percentage of drivers who received a 21+ km/h ticket decreased by 63%. ● The majority of drivers follow speed limits in Edmonton. Only 0.09% of observed vehicles through mobile enforcement and intersection safety devices were issued a ticket in 2021 (483,472,868 vehicles monitored and 425,294 tickets issued). Intersection Safety Devices ● Intersection safety devices are reducing the number and severity of crashes in Edmonton. Crashes at intersection safety device locations decreased by 16% in 2021 compared to 2019; dropping from 2,143 in 2019 to 2,653 in 2021. Insights from Crash Data ● While the 2021 Vision Zero Annual Report celebrates many accomplishments, 16 people lost their lives and 259 were seriously injured on Edmonton’s streets last year. There is much more work to do ahead through the Safe Mobility Strategy and beyond to achieve Vision Zero. ● While serious injuries and fatalities involving motorcycles, vehicles, and pedestrians decreased by 51%, 38%, and 27% respectively, serious injuries and fatalities involving people cycling increased by 17% from 2015 to 2021. ● 152 out of the 401 neighbourhoods in the city had zero serious injury or fatal crashes between 2019 and 2021. This shows that by working together, Vision Zero is a realistic and achievable target. We will continue to work hard to create safe and livable streets throughout Edmonton.

The Order issued by the Chief Medical Officer of Health for the Province of Alberta included a masking requirement under Section 3.1, stating that “A person must wear a face mask while using public transit”. In Section 2.1(f) of the Order, “public transit” is defined as including “municipal buses, light rail transit, [and] stations and terminals used in connection with them” . Downtown LRT stations are comprised of two levels. City Administration has interpreted the Order to mean that the lower portion (platform level) of these LRT Stations falls within the mandate for masking, while the upper level is not part of the station used in connection with light rail transit, and should therefore be excluded from the masking requirement.

I recently received an inquiry from a member of City Council about the National Standard of Canada for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace. I am also aware that the Greater Edmonton Alliance has shared a briefing package with you on their advocacy campaign. I look forward to presenting you with a comprehensive report this Fall as an update to the information shared in 2021 (Employee Services ES00210). However, in the meantime, I am providing a brief update in relation to these inquiries. Key initiatives that we have been working on include the expansion of our peer support program across the entire organization, continued training in The Working Mind (a mental health program for all employees), and the soon to be rolled out Domestic Violence and Your Workplace mandatory training for all People Leaders. In terms of Administration’s engagement with partners and other organizations in the area of psychological health and safety at the City, I am pleased to confirm that we meet several times during the year with the Coalition of Edmonton Civic Unions, some of which are members of the Greater Edmonton Alliance. Additionally, we will be sharing the updated report with the Coalition prior to it going to Council in order to receive their input in advance. Our team held meetings with the Greater Edmonton Alliance prior to our last Council report on this matter and we welcome input and questions from them and others as part of our future collaborative efforts. As part of continuous improvement of our programs and services, we regularly evaluate our programs and scan and seek input from other organizations, municipalities and agencies in regard to psychological health and safety best practices in the workplace. .../2 -2- As you know, we recently undertook a comprehensive external audit of our occupational health and safety management system. Preliminary results included commendations for the Citys’ focus on psychological safety and social well being. We intend to incorporate any relevant recommendations related to psychological health and safety into our report to you. We are confident that our achievements and the actions we continue to take to ensure alignment to the National Standard actively meet and exceed the requirements of the 13 factors. The Standard provides us with the framework and guidelines needed to provide for the well being of our employees and, as such, is an objective assessment of our work. With that in mind, the need for formal adoption of the Standard and the engagement of a third party assessor like Excellence Canada is not necessary. Administration remains committed to ensuring the City of Edmonton is a psychologically safe and healthy work environment for all City employees and we will continue to report to City Council on our progress on a regular basis.

This memo provides further detail about these activities, how that input will be considered in the budget development process and when Administration will provide updates on what we have heard. What we will ask Edmontonians The budget is a part of the City’s strategic framework. More than 10,000 Edmontonians were engaged in building ConnectEdmonton and The City Plan. Council endorsed The City Plan after the last election, and Administration is preparing a budget that activates The City Plan. Budget engagement should not reopen decisions that have already been made using public input, but should focus on how to bring that direction to life. Our research and engagement activities will be centred around one question: how to implement that direction, how much, how fast. What kind of input we can expect The City’s capital and operating budgets encompass all the work the City does. With so many programs and services to consider, we know that opinions on priorities will vary widely between individuals and communities, and it is certain that Edmontonians’ perspectives will likely not point in a clear direction. Administration will share with Council a picture of the range of 1 .. .. opinions and perspectives. This city-wide analysis will supplement the input that Council has received (and will receive) from their constituents. The research and engagement reports are not a standalone decision making tool —they are one of the many inputs to Council’s decision-making. Other inputs will include Priority Based Budgeting, economic information, Council policies, etc. Research and Engagement Phases Phase one: baseline research on value-for-tax perceptions In progress, completion May 2022 Purpose We are currently gathering quantitative and qualitative information to help us to understand Edmontonians’ perspectives about how the City spends public money and discover any gaps in understanding and awareness about the budget. The results of this study will not have a direct impact on the budget, but will give us guidance on the engagement approach, including what questions to ask, and how we can best communicate about the City’s financial information. Perspectives on tax tolerance will also be explored. Audience This is research, rather than engagement. It is limited in scope, but findings will be further expanded on in the engagement phase. The research consists of focus groups and one-on-one interviews to help us uncover perspectives. Their perspectives will then be tested in a survey of 1,000 participants. Updating Council Administration will share insights gained in this phase when the Capital and Operating Investment Outlooks are brought forward in early June. Phase two: budget engagement Early summer Purpose Because of the size and complexity of the City’s budget, any engagement activity requires an element of education as well. It’s important for participants to understand the imperative of tradeoffs and balance in building a public sector budget. The goal of the engagement is to validate priorities for City spending, as well as tolerance for increasing/adjusting City revenue streams. The engagement process will be fine-tuned based on the outcomes of phase one research, but we anticipate we will engage Edmontonians on the following topics: 2 Civic Survey ● Input on how participants would prioritize spending on City services and capital projects, including how to balance the long-term vision laid out in our strategic planning documents with current needs ● Further exploration of property tax and user fee tolerance (current or new) ● What to consider in making changes to property tax and user fees ● Input on opportunities to adjust costs and revenues Audience Administration will work to ensure that the engagement activities are easily accessible by any Edmontonian who is interested in participating. We will launch an awareness campaign that will include providing Council","that will include providing Council members with promotional materials to use through their channels. Extra effort will be made to reach equity-denied, under-represented and systematically excluded groups. Method This engagement effort will follow the City’s digital-first, in-person with intent approach. Our experience during the pandemic showed that online engagement alleviated barriers of time and access for most audiences. Harder to reach groups who don’t typically participate in online engagement will require targeted outreach (e.g. focused conversations). Updating Council Engagement will be conducted in the early summer and results will be shared with Council after the summer break. The input will be considered by Administration during budget development work as soon as it comes in. Phase three: civic survey Summer, update to Council in Fall, 2022 Purpose Administration is conducting a survey to explore Edmontonians’ views about living in Edmonton, and their perspectives on City service delivery. This includes understanding Edmontonians’ satisfaction with City services, the relative importance of these services, and the investment in services. This research is critical to advancing the City’s approach to improving our customer experience and it is necessary to gather information for several performance measures, including benchmarking with other Canadian cities. It is also intended to inform Council’s budget decisions with a current broad understanding of Edmontonians’ perspectives on our service levels. Audience / Method This is quantitative research, using a survey of 1,200 participants, as well as an online format to be open and accessible to all Edmontonians. Updating Council Results will be shared in early Fall. 3 Phase four: public hearing November 2022 As is our practice, there will be a non-statutory public hearing after the release of the draft budget so that individuals and impacted organizations can share their views directly with Council. Budget communications While this is not specifically engagement, it is important for Council to know that there will be a comprehensive integrated marketing and communications strategy to: ● Share the proposed budget and what that means for Edmontonians (including service and tax impacts) ● Share what we heard in previous phases and how we used that input in developing the proposed budget ● Demonstrate sound financial management and service excellence ● Keep Edmontonians informed about the process, including any final opportunities to participate in it (asking questions, public hearing etc.) Council member involvement Administration will update Council as analysis on each phase of research and engagement is completed. We will also provide cumulative updates and summaries at key points during Council discussions. To encourage participation, Administration will share details of all engagement opportunities with Council for you to amplify through your channels. If Council members have perspectives from constituents to share and to add to the information being collected, please contact Jodie Graham, Director, Budget Planning and Development.

(Prairie Sky) has proposed constructing a gondola connecting Downtown to Whyte Avenue. The alignment would include five stations: Downtown, Ortona, Rossdale Power Plant, End of Steel and Old Strathcona. This proposal would see the gondola built, operated, maintained and paid for by Prairie Sky, with an initial start-up investment of $150 million. For more information on the proposal please visit Prairie Sky’s website. The gondola proposal was last at Council in February 2021, at which time Council approved the Agreement Framework. Council has provided additional direction concerning the gondola proposal as follows; each report is included in Attachments 3-6 for reference: ● June 2018: In response to an Edmonton Transit Service Advisory Board Report on the viability of gondolas as public transit, Council directed Administration to provide a report outlining (1) the cost of a feasibility/constructability study for a gondola and (2) the commitment by private investors and communities to fund/cost share these studies. ● April 2019: Council directed Administration to work with Prairie Sky as they developed a Phase 1 Preliminary Economic and Technical Assessment. ● February 2020: Council outlined key principles for the project. Attachment 1 includes a section by section update on the principles defined by Council. Beyond the Council-defined principles, the City’s primary role in the gondola proposal is twofold: ● First, the City owns the land upon which Prairie Sky proposes to construct the gondola and must complete land agreements with Prairie Sky. ● Second, the City is a regulator of development and would ultimately be the decision making authority regarding required rezonings, consideration of the North Saskatchewan River Valley Area Redevelopment Plan (River Valley Bylaw), and permitting. Council is the decision maker on rezoning and amendments to the River Valley Bylaw. Land Agreements: Administration currently anticipates advancing the land agreements for decision at the August 10, 2022 Executive Committee meeting. This memo provides an update on the work underway about the gondola proposal in support of informed decision making on the land agreements. The land agreements are currently in the late stages of negotiation. There are two primary land agreements: the first is a long term lease for the Gondola stations, and the second agreement is a license and access agreement for the other Gondola infrastructure (such as the rope lines and towers) that will be located on road and titled City lands. The agreements will contain a number of conditions precedent including requiring Prairie Sky to obtain the completion of regulatory approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities — including the City. In alignment with previous Council direction, a key consideration of the land agreements for Administration is risk mitigation for the City. If Prairie Sky does not fulfill the conditions precedent reflected in the agreements, then the land agreements would be terminated and the Gondola would not proceed. Prairie Sky intends to advance rezonings on the impacted lands should the land agreements be approved; however, there is a requirement under Section 70 of the Municipal Government Act to publicly advertise the proposal to grant a leasehold interest in public park and recreation lands before Council considers whether to approve the land agreements. Administration expects these advertisements to run May 21 and May 28, 2022 per advertising requirements defined in the Municipal Government Act. Following the advertisements, a 60 day period prior to Council making a decision will occur; during this period petitions against the City's proposal to lease land may be filed. A Council decision on the land agreements would provide reassurance on land availability before Prairie Sky initiates the regulatory process. Confirmation of land availability is particularly relevant for this project given the technical nature of the alignment. Prairie Sky noted this sequencing will allow for advancement of other work required before the gondola’s construction, including",", including regulatory approvals and detailed design — processes that require significant financial contributions. Proposed Alignment: Updates Since Council approved the Agreement Framework in 2021, Prairie Sky has proposed new locations for two gondola stations. Prairie Sky has communicated that the previously considered locations for stations on the south leg of the alignment are no longer viable because of evolving discussions with other orders of government related to the existing rail right of way located at Whyte Avenue and Gateway Boulevard. The new proposed locations, which are reflected on the alignment map included in Attachment 2, will be included in the land agreements when they advance to Executive Committee. Key impacts to the City resulting from the new station locations relate to two planning exercises. First is the Old Strathcona Public Realm Strategy which is tasked with developing a vision for the future redevelopment of this corridor, and is now advancing following delays due to impacts of the pandemic. The second relates to the Mass Transit Planning for 1.25 Million People report which identifies Whyte Avenue and Gateway Boulevard as the intersection of two future mass transit routes. Ongoing discussions between Prairie Sky and Administration on these locations will need to consider the impacts of the proposed gondola on these evolving plans. Next Steps: In addition to the work underway in response to Council’s principles reflected in Attachment 1, and the land agreements that are expected to advance to Executive Committee in August, there are a number of regulatory processes that will unfold. Administration's expectation is that Prairie Sky will fulfill all regulatory requirements for development in our city. Future Council decisions on the proposed gondola will relate to the land development application which consists of rezonings, statutory plan amendments, and consideration of the North Saskatchewan River Valley Area Redevelopment Plan (River Valley Bylaw). If you would like to schedule a time to discuss the gondola proposal further, please reach out to Bartosz Jarocki (bartosz.jarocki@edmonton.ca). We would be happy to work with your team to schedule conversations accordingly. Kind regards, SP/bj","No",,,

The 2022 net operating requirement (expenses less revenue) by department/program is available in the 2022 Budget Highlights document posted on the City’s website. The tax-supported net operating requirement by branch by year is shown starting on page 20. Included below is a pie chart that shows the distribution of net operating requirements for 2022 categorized by program. In some instances the pie chart categories reflect a combination of different branches and sections within the City. To compute the percentages, this pie chart attributes corporate revenues on a proportionate basis to arrive at the percentage allocation of the net operating requirement by category. Similar pie charts for revenues and expenditures are included in the 2022 Budget Highlights document.

The information is compiled from publicly available budget documents on the City’s website. * Note that EPS as a percentage of the net operating requirement for tax-supported operations as calculated in this table is greater than reflected in the net operating requirement pie chart. The categories in the pie chart are net of the proportionate allocation of corporate revenues across the tax-supported categories. The total net operating requirement of the City reflects the accumulation of net operating requirements of all programs offset by corporate revenues that are not directly attributed to a specific program area. The net operating requirement for Edmonton Police Services, Edmonton Public Library, and Edmonton Transit in the table above do not reflect a prorated portion of corporate revenues, and reflect only the expenses less revenues specific to each area. ** Note that 2020, 2021 and 2022 budgets reflect the one-time adjustments for COVID-19. Edmonton Public Library reduced their budget as a result of library closures and reduced expenses in the pandemic. This reduction was used to address pandemic impacts across the corporation. ***The net operating requirement for transit service does not reflect the significant decline in revenue experienced in the pandemic. ETS revenue was supplemented with revenue from the Municipal Operating Support Transfer to mitigate the impact on tax levy budgets. The information request also asked for specific information related to Waste Management, Climate Resilience, and Affordable Housing. Waste Management information is not included within the overall net operating requirement for tax-levy departments, as operations are funded through utility rates.

The High Level Line Society has developed a concept for a 4.3 km long, multi-modal corridor extending from MacEwan University (and the bike lane on 105 Avenue) to Whyte Avenue at Gateway Boulevard. It considers utilizing the old Canadian Pacific Railway right-of-way through Strathcona, Garneau, the North Saskatchewan River valley, Downtown, and Oliver. The concept describes potential infrastructure improvements along the full length of this corridor, including a total of 8 nodes that include: ● MacEwan Gateway (north end of the High Level Line); ● Railtown Green; ● Jasper Avenue; ● Legislature Junction; ● High Level Bridge; ● Garneau Tunnel; ● Strathcona Gardens; and, ● Whyte Avenue (south end of the High Level Line). Since the release of the High Level Line Society's concept plan, Administration has considered potential alignment with various open space, transportation, and public realm strategies. For instance, the Downtown Public Places Plan identifies the importance of a continuous green corridor from Queen Mary Park to the High Level Bridge and into the River Valley with a series of activity nodes and points of intersection. The open spaces of the Railtown Green will be multi-functional, supporting active transportation, recreation, and small-scale tourism. Additionally, the North Landing of the High Level Bridge is identified as one of the plan’s Big Moves because of its role as a key public place and connection node between Ezio Faraone Park, the Legislature Grounds, and the Ribbon of Steel greenway. Opportunities for alignment with the High Level Line Society's concept plan were considered with recently completed projects. In addition, new opportunities will to be considered through current and future planned work. These include: Completed ● The 105 Avenue streetscape and active-mode work west of 109 Street; ● The newly constructed segment of Imagine Jasper Avenue (109 Street to 114 Street); ● Strathcona and Garneau Neighbourhood Renewal shared pathway along the rail corridor; 2 Current ● the High Level Bridge rehabilitation project; ● the Old Strathcona Public Realm Strategy; ● Ribbon of Green and River Valley Modernization; Future ● Oliver Neighbourhood Renewal; ● Whyte Avenue Renewal; ● North Shore Promenade/Touch the Water; and ● Downtown Public Places Plan Implementation. The 2023-2026 Capital Budget development process has commenced and will confirm capital priorities including those referenced as future projects. At this time, it is not certain what additional open space projects will be advanced to support the High Level Line Society's concept plan in the next budget cycle. However, Administration will continue to consider potential alignment with the High Level Line Society's concept plan with the various projects and plans advancing. c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk IIS Branch Managers c:;!YJ-Pf",,"No",,,

The new freeway will play an important part in sustaining growth and regional prosperity as we grow towards a city of two million people. Program Overview When completed, the Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion will improve the operational capacity, safety and level of service of the corridor and supporting road network. The program is being implemented through a combination of large and small projects, including off-corridor network improvements to support the new freeway, local businesses and communities. These projects (from west to east) are: 1. 156 Street to St. Albert Trail; including the 149 and 142 Street intersections 2. St. Albert Trail to 97 Street; including the 127, 124, 121, and 107 Street intersections 3. 97 Street to 82 Street; including the 89 Street intersection 4. 82 Street to 61 Street; including the 66 Street intersection 5. Fort Road Widening (Yellowhead Trail to 66 Street) 6. East Widening (61 Street to the North Saskatchewan River) Additional information on each project is provided in Attachment 1. The design of the remaining projects is scheduled to be completed by 2023, with construction anticipated to continue through to the end of 2027. A summary of the anticipated program schedule is provided in Attachment 2. 2 2022 Project Highlights St. Albert Trail to 97 Street: Design Phase Design of the St. Albert Trail to 97 Street project is underway and is anticipated to be complete by the end of 2023. Additional engagement opportunities are planned for late May 2022 and will involve community conversations with residential neighbourhoods adjacent to Yellowhead Trail. As the project progresses through the design phase, the project team will build upon the work completed during concept planning to further define project scope, alignments and related components of the main corridor and supporting road and active mode transportation networks. A Request for Proposal for Construction Management services was recently completed and it is anticipated that an agreement with the preferred proponent will be in place by July 2022. Yellowhead Trail Rehabilitation: 107 Street to Fort Road: Design Phase The rehabilitation project includes the renewal of the roadway base, paving, and selective replacement of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. Design commenced in the fall of 2021 and is scheduled to be completed late summer 2022. Construction is anticipated to begin in late spring 2023. 2022 Construction Activities Construction of the 3-year Fort Road Widening project began in the spring of 2021 and will extend through to the end of 2023. Construction activities continued through the winter with a focus primarily on utility installations and preparations for the construction of the temporary rail bridge structures. It is anticipated that rail traffic will be transferred to the temporary bridge structures in June 2022. The primary focus will then shift to the reconstruction of the new permanent CN Rail bridge structure and the construction of the new southbound lanes. Construction of the 3-year 156 Street to St. Albert Trail project began in the summer of 2021 and will extend through to the end of 2023. Construction activities through the winter included the installation of utility and drainage infrastructure, bridge pier strengthening and construction of the south retaining wall at the St. Albert Trail interchange. Replacement of the noise wall between 142 Street and St. Albert Trail, ongoing utility works and service road construction is planned for the 2022 construction season. Construction of the Noise Wall Replacement (97 Street to Fort Road) began early in 2022 with the removal of the existing noise wall starting at 97 Street and progressing eastward to Fort Road. Pile foundations for the new wall have been installed from 97 Street to approximately 87 Street. Although the project team has experienced some challenges with panel fabrication, it is anticipated that installation of the new panels will commence in early June 2022. Public Engagement and Communications In 20","2022, public engagement will focus on the St. Albert Trail to 97 Street project The next phase of engagement is planned for late May 2022 and will involve community conversations with neighbourhoods adjacent to Yellowhead Trail. Engagement opportunities will include Engaged Edmonton input, surveys, and online and in-person stakeholder meetings. In 2022, communications will focus on sharing information related to the ongoing construction activities and upcoming engagement opportunities. Social media continues to play a key role with the dedicated @YEGYellowhead Twitter account providing timely updates on current construction activities. Additionally, in April 2022, program postcards were mailed to homes and businesses along the Yellowhead Trail corridor from approximately 170 Street to Victoria Trail, 3 and from 137 Avenue to 118 Avenue. The purpose of the postcard mailout was to continue to build awareness by sharing program information and to encourage residents and businesses to visit the project website for progress updates. The postcard mailout resulted in a noticeable increase in email subscriptions and an increase in the number of followers of the program's twitter account. Land Acquisition Efforts have been made to minimize impacts to the adjacent business and residential communities along the corridor. All land requirements have been identified and negotiations are ongoing with numerous property owners or their designated agents to work towards agreements. To ensure land requirements are secured in advance of the start of construction of the St. Albert Trial to 97 Street project, discussions with property owners directly impacted by the proposed area network changes are ongoing. However, to protect project timelines and schedule commitments a request for approval to expropriate the identified property interests is scheduled for the City Council meeting on May 24, 2022. Budget/Financial The Program overall continues to trend within budget and on target to meet schedule commitments. However, the Fort Road Widening project is currently projecting a budget shortfall as a result of a significant increase in project scope and the costs associated with the CN Rail bridge structure being higher than anticipated. To address the forecasted project shortfall, a request to increase the project budget by transferring available funds from Capital Profile CM-99-9600 to Capital Profile 21-20-9302 will be included in the upcoming 2022 Supplementary Capital Budget Adjustment report (no net budget increase).

Initiatives are being aligned with the overarching strategic guidance provided through The City Plan (2020) and the Urban Forest Asset Management Plan (2021). In 2021, the Urban Tree Canopy Expansion project leveraged provincial municipal stimulus funding, capital growth funding, and funding through the corporate tree reserve, to plant 3,000 new park and boulevard trees, and approximately 12 hectares of naturalization. This year our goal is to plant 3,000 new park and boulevard trees and approximately 5 hectares of naturalization. Public engagement, completed to inform The City Plan, showed overwhelming public support for adding new trees to the city. We have reached out to Community Leagues in the neighbourhoods noted below who have assisted in reviewing proposed designs and shared information on the existing use of the open spaces planned for planting. Stakeholder engagement with internal and external subject matter experts was also conducted in 2021. From May 2-16, a public survey is being conducted online to spread awareness of the upcoming planting season. Neighbourhoods noted below will be notified of the project schedule through the area's Community Leagues. Residents who may be impacted by the contractor work will be provided with a notification letter in the mail.

The City offers discounted and free passes for certain City services to Edmonton residents with refugee status. In alignment with our commitment to being an inclusive and compassionate city and helping everyone feel that they belong, we have decided to provide Ukrainian displaced citizens with the same passes. The City will provide those who fall under the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET) with the following, if they choose to apply: ● A free one-year membership for City recreation facilities under the Leisure Access Program. In addition, Edmonton hosts of CUAET people can include their Ukrainian guests as part of their household recreation passes, if applicable. ● A free, one-year attractions membership, for admission to places like the Edmonton Valley Zoo and Muttart Conservatory. ● A 75 per cent discount rate for city registered programs like fitness and aquatics classes. ● Access to monthly transit passes at a discounted rate through the Ride Transit low income transit pass program for a period of one year, in alignment with eligibility for refugee status. ● As part of an international movement to help children who have not fled Ukraine, both the Edmonton Valley Zoo and Muttart Conservatory are facilitating virtual programs for 250 Ukrainian school children who are currently unable to attend school for safety reasons. The goal of this growing movement is to provide a fun and educational experience for students in the Ukraine to help aid in distracting from the reality of life outside the bunker walls. These adjustments are being implemented today. We will continue to work with the Ukrainian Canadian Congress - Alberta Chapter, Red Cross Canada, Catholic Social Services and other community organizations to ensure CUAET residents and their hosts are aware of the discount passes and how to access them. Should you have any questions about these decisions or the City of Edmonton’s further support for displaced Ukrainian citizens, please contact me or Niki Anderson, Acting Deputy Fire Chief of Emergency Operations at 780-985-6549.

We encourage City Council to refer to edmonton.ca/indigenoushistorymonth and Edmonton.ca/mmiwg for up to date information. Red Dress Day, May 5 Métis artist Jaime Black who helped inspire the red dress movement. Her REDdress art installation evolved into the annual Red Dress Day and sparked a grassroots movement across North America – a visual representation of the pain and loss felt by the families of victims and their survivors – shedding light on the issues of missing and murdered Indigenous women. On May 5, people across North America hang red dresses in private and public spaces to remember missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and in solidarity with family members and loved ones. The grassroots Stolen Sisters and Brothers Action Movement planned events in Edmonton to commemorate this day. Moose Hide Campaign, May 12 The Moose Hide Campaign is an Indigenous-led campaign started by co-founders Paul Lacerte and his daughter Raven, in 2011 when they were hunting together on their traditional Carrier territory. They were close to the Highway of Tears in northern British Columbia, where many people have gone missing or have been murdered, particularly Indigenous women and girls. The ultimate goal of the campaign is to end violence towards women and children. In order to achieve this, the campaign challenges men and boys everywhere to: ● Stand up with women and children and speak out against violence towards them. ● Support each other as men and hold each other accountable. ● Teach boys the true meaning of love and respect and be healthy role models for them. ● Heal our community as men and support our brothers on their healing journey. Although the challenge was targeted to men and boys, everyone is invited to get involved in the campaign. People of all genders, ages and cultures are invited to take part and make a pledge. Administration is partnering with the Indigenous Sport Council of Alberta to host a public event at City Hall Plaza on the day of the national launch of the campaign (May 12th). This event is to bring public awareness of the issues, and to provide an opportunity for leaders in the community to publicly take the pledge. Opportunities for Involvement: ● Attend the event on May 12th (1PM to 4PM) ● Make the pledge personally and share with networks (social media toolkit) ● Register for the campaign and check out the learning workshops hosted by the Moosehide Campaign ● Tune in to the virtual National campaign event ● Fasting has been an important part of the Moosehide Campaign and there is information and guidance provided through the campaign’s website ● Donate Okisikow Way Day, June 14 Okisikow (Angel) Way was unveiled on June 14, 2011. Located on 101A Avenue between 97 and 96 Street, Angel Way was named in honour of all women and children who have experienced violence, making Edmonton the fifth city in Canada to have such a street. Artist Gloria Neapetung worked with community organizers to create the sign for Okisikow Way. The “Angel Street'' initiative began in Iqualit, Nunavut in 2007. Iqaluit Mayor Elisapee Sheutiapik challenged other Canadian municipalities to commemorate and raise awareness about female victims of violence. On June 14th, 2022 community members and the City of Edmonton will honour Okisikow Way. More details will follow. Other Events related to MMIWG2S+ Awareness include Walk a Mile in a Ribbon Skirt and Sisters in Spirit Day which occur on or near October 4, 2022. More details will be available later this summer.

Administration strives to balance public safety regulations with barrier reductions and since 2020 has made improvements related to the fireworks permitting processes to align with the requirements of the Public Places Bylaw 14614, section 9.1, which states that the discharge of fireworks requires a permit. Fireworks pose a direct risk to the safety of both those discharging them and those nearby who may be impacted. To preserve public safety and mitigate the risks associated with non-professional use of fireworks, Administration will be recommending that permits for the display of fireworks be limited to those holding valid Fireworks Operator Certificates and licenses as per the Federal Explosive Regulations, for the following reasons: ● Most private lots in Edmonton are not large enough to meet the safe discharge requirements for fireworks, and would not be eligible to obtain permits under the current Tier I process ● The limited capacity and ability to enforce the conditions of Tier I permits create additional liability for the City ● Fireworks are directly linked to fire and injury risk which can be mitigated through professional, certified discharge City administration will continue to support safe and vibrant communities through the continued use of fireworks to be enjoyed as part of large celebrations and events that meet the requirements of the Tier II permit. In addition, we have taken steps to streamline professional fireworks shows (Tier II) permits. Specifically, Fire Rescue Services has implemented the following improvements: ● Improved Fireworks web pages on edmonton.ca to make the current rules and regulations easier to understand. ● Publicly posted a checklist for Tier II permit applications to help show providers submit complete applications. ../2 - 2 - ● Developed and implemented a pre-approval process for Community Leagues for Tier II show sites to expedite permit approval. The pre-approval process provides guidance for site placement and firework product size. ● The report requests approval for reducing the Tier II permit fee from $147 to $100. To increase the accessibility of permits, EFRS created fire mitigation alternatives for permits issued to certified operators. In cases when the safety zone contains combustibles and/or any uninhabited buildings or public areas, Administration works with the applicant to review mitigation strategies that would allow the show to occur while maintaining fire safety. Our recommendations are informed by public safety implications, local injury data, enforcement gaps and liability risks to the City. Fireworks are an important part of community, festival and religious celebrations, and Administration has made it easier for show providers to continue shooting Tier II fireworks while maintaining safety. Administration has demonstrated continuous commitment to working with show providers via Tier II permits or Display Permits to approve as many community shows as possible. Administration is cognisant that the proposed changes may impact firework vendors in the city. An implementation plan will be developed, informed by stakeholder input. We look forward to the continued discussion on May 30 - in the meantime, we have signaled our intent to the local major fireworks vendors, as well as the Canadian National Fireworks Association. Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you, Joe Zatylny C: Office of the City Manager Office of the City Clerk Executive Leadership Team",,"No",,,

Much of this information will also be reflected in the public safety plan being developed in response to a letter from the Government of Alberta. In short, Administration will be expediting plans, advancing projects, increasing collaboration, and resourcing new initiatives to support community safety and well-being. Below is an overview of the actions we are taking. I will be meeting with the Chinatown and Area Business Association prior to June 3 and regularly thereafter to maintain momentum and hear their feedback as progress is made. Effective immediately, the City will: ● Provide a detailed breakdown of all resources and funding provided to support Chinatown. This will be delivered as part of the Mayor's next meeting. Written handouts will also be provided. Much of this detail is also cited in the attachment. ● Implement a public washroom plan with focus on Chinatown and clearly articulate timing, location, and operational plans which will be coordinated with the Chinatown and Area Business Association ● Provide a $300,000 grant to the Chinatown and Area Business Association to help fund private security resources in and throughout Chinatown so that businesses do not need to pay for this out of their own pockets. ● Review and clarify the powers, authorities and procedures for bylaw officers, private security and police so that businesses and community partners have a shared understanding of the types of enforcement that can be expected. ● Refrain from sending written warnings to owners to clean up properties. Instead, we will communicate directly with those owners and let them know how we can assist them to clean up both public areas in front of their businesses and private property. 1 ● Implement a Chinatown needle cleanup program. ● Commence a daily cleaning of streets and back alleys throughout Chinatown. ● Establish a dedicated Chinatown post-COVID vibrancy fund along the same model as the Downtown Recovery Coalition. Funds will be dispersed by a Chinatown Committee that will oversee priorities and decisions. We recommend that the Chinatown and Area Business Association lead this committee and that a City advisor be appointed to convene this group. It will commence with a $1 million fund to be announced by the Mayor, and approved through my delegated authority using the Financial Stabilization Reserve as the funding source. The aim of this fund is to equitably distribute resources to those who have not been able to access downtown recovery funds due to boundary constraints. ● Develop an improved streetscape plan for the core in Chinatown to assist with prevention of encampment set ups. This will be funded through the Chinatown Recovery Fund. ● Review with the Chinatown and Area Business Association acceptable mutual aid agencies they are willing to work with based on previous issues. ● Develop multilingual information materials where information needs are identified. ● Complete a safety audit of Chinatown, present findings and recommendations to the Chinatown and Area Business Association, and prepare an implementation plan to address all recommendations. ● Commence a Chinatown promotion campaign with a focus on attracting patrons to Chinatown businesses. ● When possible, provide the Chinatown and Area Business Association with a summary of actions on fires in the area. This will be subject to the completion of ongoing investigations. Over the longer term, the City will: ● Work with Chinatown on a Community Enhancement Plan for Council consideration. ● Create a 5 year plan for a decentralization of social services to limit the concentration in Chinatown. ● Consider rules and regulations within City Administration for the operation of not for profits, to address the perception that rules are unfair for profit-making business owners compared to not for profits. ● Advocate to the province for: ● a prohibition on releasing health patients into houselessness. ● a prohibition of releasing offenders from provincial corrections facilities into houselessness. ● limits to pharmacy concentration in Chinatown. ● Advocat","n Chinatown. ● Advocate to the federal government for a prohibition of releasing offenders from federal corrections facilities into houselessness. ● Consider limiting new permits for additional social agencies in Chinatown. ● Review the Boyle Street Development Plan and assess impacts before proceeding further. ● Co-ordinate with social agencies and charities to: ○ Convene a constructive and facilitated planning session between social agencies and Chinatown business owners to review and address operating procedures that negatively impact businesses and residents ○ Convene a meeting of social agencies with provincial and federal governments to focus on issues in Chinatown. 2 ○ Implement a community-wide public awareness campaign reminding charities and charitable people not to drop resources off randomly in Chinatown. The City will reach out directly to charities and provide on-site education when these incidents take place to correct this problem. The City will also enlist the support of faith-based groups to amplify this messaging. ○ As the above occurs, explore if there are permitting and bylaw rules to clarify which organizations can deliver resources to Chinatown ○ Ask agencies to re-consider methods of food distribution to minimize litter in and around Chinatown. ○ Investigate whether eating and food preparation spaces can be added at the Herb Jamieson shelter, and explore funding options through private donations, government contributions and public-private partnerships. These adjustments would reduce queues at the Hope Mission, and could reduce litter in the community. ● Hire a social agencies client co-ordinator who would work with the Chinatown and Area Business Association and social agencies to identify and resolve issues and support compliance with the Good Neighbour Plan. ● Review and improve all good neighbour agreements. Increase co-ordination with Edmonton Police Service: ● Commence integrated joint teams including EPS, Fire, EMS, Social agencies, and City Peace Officers under joint unified command. The City is resourced for this and EPS will do what they can within their resources. These teams will also closely coordinate with private security firms operating in Chinatown. ● Request EPS review their custody release procedures as described by business owners, and amend procedures where possible. ● Enhance presence of EPS, Bylaw, EMS, and private security to achieve nearly 24/7 monitoring of Chinatown. Other Actions Already Underway: ● The actions in the document attached are already underway and grouped by City department for clarity. Should you have any questions please let me know. AC/tl Attachment: Chinatown Projects and Support 3 Dept. Projects/Grants/Touchpoints OCM ● On May 24, 2022 City Council approved $300K on a one-time basis for the purpose of addressing the immediate needs of Chinatown discussions with the community are underway to allocate this funding to the most immediate needs. ● Community Property Safety Team is an active pilot project working to secure vacant properties with a concentration of effort in the north east quadrant including Chinatown. To date, no properties have been secured in the Chinatown area, but residents are encouraged to report vacant unsecured properties via 311. ● EFRS Fire Prevention will dispatch a Fire Prevention Officer to inspect any encampment that has elevated the fire risk of a nearby building. If the encampment or related fire load represents an imminent danger to a building, the Officer can order the encampment be removed to mitigate the risk. These orders will only be made in consultation with the Fire Marshal or Deputy Chief of Public Safety ● EFRS Operations staff will begin the Residential Fire Alarm program in early June which will include the offer of testing and checking for the presence of smoke alarms in residential occupancies. If a smoke alarm is found expired or faulty, or is not present, Firefighters can offer to install an alarm in the residence. CO ● Parks & Roads Services/BIA Infrastructure: ○ Cross-street lantern scheme electrical design has started, with potential implementation for Mid Autumn Festival in September 2022 or Lunar New Year, January 2023. 97 Street from 105 Ave to 107 A Ave. ○ Banner program currently in place on 97 Street from 105 Ave to 107 A Ave. Design will be changed in September 2022. ○ Temporary public washrooms - BIA is not interested in temporary locations. ○ Streetscape reporting - Summer students hired to support BIAs with reporting streetscape deficiencies. Cohen Leibel assigned to work with Chinatown BIA. Introductory meeting to be scheduled early June. ○ Spring sweep in Chinatown was completed over the weekend. An additional sweep is being performed tonight to capture any remaining loose litter. ○ Downtown Special Waste Collection is providing daily patrols of roads, sidewalks and alleyways for litter, debris, needles and biohazards, as well as supporting vacant encampment clean-up within the downtown core, including many key locations within the Chinatown BIA, such as between 97-99 Street and 100-107A Avenue. In less busy locations within the BIA, crews visit as needed and as time and resources permit (approximately weekly). Public locations that currently have people residing on them are not visited by crews until they are vacated. ● Waste Services manages contracts for the maintenance of a number of litter bins within Chinatown. CS ● On May 24, City Council approved $25K on a one time basis to fund the Community Liaison Committee collaborative (COE, AHS and community partners) to enhance educational and awareness opportunities about the crisis, provide compensation for living and lived experience, and ensure supplies are available in the community. ● On April 4, 2022 City Council Approved $1.8M to fund day services at the Bissell Centre Community Space (10530 96 Street). Those services include: ○ two meals a day and beverages for guests; ○ access to washrooms, with at least one barrier-free and gender-neutral washroom; ○ use of shower facilities; ○ use of self serve laundry services; ○ intake and referral services; ○ drop-in space for respite; ○ recreational activities; ○ housing services, including access to experienced staff on site at the facility dedicated to supporting guests on their pathway to permanent housing ○ Indigenous cultural support and trauma-informed services, such as Elder cultural support workers and access to culturally-framed counselling; ○ mental health support, including referrals to external health agencies, addiction support services, therapeutic and holistics supports ○ Note: prior to any payment of the City Funding being made, the Bissell Centre delivered a Good Neighbour Plan to the City evidencing the Bissell Centre’s commitment to maintain neighbourhood relations in respect of the Project, and containing general information about the Project, service standards, information about cleanliness and security, and contact information for neighbour concerns; ● Working with Social Enterprise vendors via Capital City Clean Up, in 2021 approx $42,000 was spent on litter removal in the Chinatown BIA. ● In 2022, Capital City Clean Up is involved in: ○ Graffiti Reduction ■ Proactive removal of graffiti from public property / EPCOR assets in Chinatown BIA ■ Increased eligibility for removal of graffiti using Professional Graffiti Cleaning - elimination of police reporting requirement and unlimited funding for private property removal ○ Litter Reduction ■ $25K is available to Chinatown BIA for social enterprise litter reduction in 2022. ■ Dedicated litter and needle removal using social enterprise is expected to start on a recurring schedule starting in June 2022. ● Municipal Enforcement Officers are conducting proactive patrols throughout the area to address untidy locations and connect owners with the supports linked in this document. Locations deemed untidy/unsightly that are a result of an encampment or social disorder will receive a notice that city resources are now available to assist the landowners / businesses with clean up of their property at no charge. ● The Encampment Response Team’s Park Ranger Peace Officers, partnered with the Edmonton Police Service, investigate complaints about encampments on public land in Chinatown. ○ Of the approximately 77 active encampments located downtown and awaiting initial investigation and assessment, 12 encampments are located in the Chinatown area. ○ Some of these encampments include multiple structures and, once investigated, they will be evaluated using our risk matrix and then scheduled for clean up. Historically, most urban encampments are evaluated as high risk and are typically scheduled for closure and clean up within 1-3 days of initial investigation and assessment. ○ Referrals to services are always shared with people living in encampments and, where the level of risk posed to the health and well-being of people in the encampment and the surrounding community allows, housing and other outreach workers engage with those experiencing homelessness to connect them with the services they need. ○ On May 25, 2022, the High Risk Encampment Team and Downtown EPS Beat members organised and supervised the City Operations clean up of an encampment site on106 Ave between 99 and 100 St. ● Representatives from Community Standards and Neighbourhoods and Social Development meet with representatives from Chinatown and other agencies and government service providers regularly as part of the provincial government’s Coordinated Community Response to Homelessness Task Force’s work on a pilot program to be delivered this summer in the Chinatown area. ● Community Standards Downtown Peace Officers are continuing to be deployed into the Chinatown community. Our Downtown Team that consisted of 14 peace officers will receive up to four officers daily to conduct foot patrols of the Chinatown community and BIA. Peace Officers will be in full uniform high visibility to provide guardianship in collaboration with other stakeholders including the Edmonton Police Service. Peace Officer marked patrol units will also be visible in the community as an additional safety presence. Key focus will be public safety, crime and disorder deterrence and high public engagement. Hours of operation - 0600 - 2200 hrs. Our Downtown team collaborates with the Transit Peace Officers as required particularly for issues that intersect with DT ETS stations. ○ The adjustment of service levels includes: ■ reducing the patrol footprint of the downtown team from 98 Avenue to 107 Avenue and 109 Street to 95 Street - the team will be solely focused on Chinatown and the civic precinct ■ peace officer overtime for Council and Committee meetings ● The Community Safety Team has a Community Safety Liaison (CSL) that supports Chinatown, we also are partners with the YEG Ambassadors which work in Chinatown. ○ The CSL works with the community to reduce incidents of social disorder and crime (including safety presentations and training, SARA projects, Safety Audits and CPTED assessments). The CSL for Chinatown just provided the CPTED recommendations recently. The CSL also sits on the safety table REACH created in Chinatown. ○ The YEG Ambassadors provide an “on-the-street” presence in Edmonton’s Business Improvement Area (BIAs). Working in the North Edge, Chinatown, and the Quarters, they connect businesses to the resources and services they need to succeed while engaging with and supporting visitors, community members, and social agencies ● Monthly community touchpoint meetings, but not just for Chinatown, for all neighbourhoods impacted by encampments and unsheltered homelessness. This was originally for the two temporary shelters and we are transitioning with the first meeting next week. ● Edmonton FCSS , Anti Racism Grants and other community grants (such as community league grants) provide funding for projects, programs and services that operate in and around the Chinatown area. ● RECOVER currently does not have any projects in Chinatown, but are exploring the idea of doing Auricle or Soloss in the Fall in that neighbourhood. ● Partner organizations like REACH operate in the space (through programs like 24/7 crisis diversion) and host a community safety table created in Chinatown. ● While some of our areas do not have direct relationships, some of our close partners do. For example: ○ McCauley School which houses the Intercultural Centre has lots of community interactions in the area. ○ Some other agencies we work with like Centre for Race and Culture and John Humphrey Centre (part of ELIP) also do work in the area. ○ Homeward Trust funds Bissell Centre Housing Outreach Team (HOPP) that connects people living in encampments to permanent housing. ○ Boyle Street Community Services operates their Community Space Monday to Friday from 8:30am-4:30pm ● There was a Community Building Social Worker assigned to the 118 Avenue area but MAPS Alberta did a vulnerability map to determine communities with increased vulnerabilities and few city resources. Multiple factors are considered in these redeployments, including: the areas with increased or increasing vulnerability scores, areas with Civida complexes that have community centres which the social workers liaise with, proximity to city recreation centres for integration, and the presence of other city supports like revitalization. ○ For Friday: The removal of a social worker was mentioned at Council so it may be a question to Admin as to why a social worker was removed. ● Bissell Centre & Boyle Street Services have city-funded Outreach Teams that do wellness checks and connect people living in encampments with housing and other supports. ○ Bissell Centre: via the 2022 Day Service Subsidy Agreement for $1.8M, FCSS funding for Early childhood Development and Family Support - $430K ○ Boyle Street: 2020-2024 contract for $2.3M, FCSS funding for 2022 includes Inner City Outreach and Liaison $545K,Community Wellness Connection Program $85K and Volunteer Program$47K. ● Boyle McCauley Health Centre Mobile Overdose Prevention Team responds to overdoses in McCauley and Chinatown neighbourhood. ● A representative from Chinatown BIA declined being a member of the committee and the Chinatown Transformation Collaborative (CTC) was a member of the Drug Poisoning Community Liaison Committee but just resigned a few weeks ago. ● The McCauley Revitalization Coordinator meets with the Chinatown representatives and stakeholders six times a year through the Chinatown Safety Council and more frequently with the Chinatown Safety Council Working Group. Revitalization meets/communicates weekly with representatives from the Chinatown Transformation Collaborative Society about project funding and communicates with the Chinatown BIA about once a month. ● Revitalization has provided the following funding in 2021 and 2022: ○ Chinatown and Area BIA - $4500 for hanging baskets to improve beautification in public urban areas and communities in 2022 and $20,000 in 2021 for the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration ○ Chinatown Transformation Collaborative (CTC) - $1850 for a case competition which is a partnership to generate possible solutions for core problems of the area - how to make Chinatown a destination for all Edmontonians (application still under review) and $1750 for a monthly volunteer cleanup of litter and needles in 2022. CTC also submitted applications for $16,710 for a Welcome to Chinatown Project and $12,960 for a 97 St Lighting Project (planning phase) in 2021 but will be submitting these both for 2022. ○ REACH - $5000 for a safety lighting project in 2021 ○ Other funding for the area includes $350 for an Art Challenge Project in 2022 and $808 for Chinatown Dining Week. IIS ● On June 15, 2022, Administration will be providing an update on progress in implementing the Chinatown Strategy’s recommended capital investments including status of the relocation of the Harbin Gate, progress on streetscaping and park improvements. ● Separate packages for implementation of the Chinatown Strategy, specifically for Planning and Design of Mary Burlie Park and Delivery of future phases of 105 (Columbia) Avenue were provided for budget deliberations, but were not approved in the 2019-2022 Budget Cycle. Opportunities were to be leveraged through renewal projects. ● Major streetscape improvements are coordinated with road renewal projects as the most cost-effective way for implementation. ● Residential roads identified in the Strategy, including 105 (Columbia) Avenue, are being coordinated with the Boyle Street/McCauley Neighbourhood Renewal project for construction in 2023-2025. ● In order to proceed with manufacturing and installation of the New Harbin Gate, approval of a capital profile with a funding source is required. The Amended Downtown CRL could be a potential funding source for the New Harbin Gate. ● 97 Street Bridge is not owned by the City but is identified in the Chinatown Strategy as an asset that needs to be addressed (ideas range from removal to retention). It will be included in the overall Station Lands agreement as part of the privately owned amenity space that will be addressed in a future phase of development. ● Mary Burlie Park improvements are being coordinated with the Boyle Street/McCauley Neighbourhood Renewal project for construction in 2023-2025. UPE ● The Chinatown Strategy was developed to provide direction and vision for various Actions that could help revitalize the neighbourhood. A key component was the creation and financial support for the Chinatown Transformation Collaborative Society (CTC) to help support and coordinate some of the action with all stakeholders. City staff help coordinate ● Neighbourhood Renewal is consulting the CTC and Business Improvement Area (BIA) on possible improvements to the public realm or road right of way (that are mentioned in the Chinatown Strategy and Chinatown Urban Interface plan). CTC has listed and advocated for various initiatives which are mentioned in the IIS section above. ● CTC are coordinating or working with other agencies (The Works or CRCs etc.) on grants at other levels of Government to try support other vibrancy initiatives in Chinatown. ● In 2021, the Chinatown BIA was provided with an Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant through the Business Association Stream of $25,700 dedicated to a litter cleanup and pressure washing project to provide some enhanced service to the area. ● The Chinatown Immersive Light Experience has been awarded $35,000 from the Downtown Vibrancy Strategy grant: this includes digital projections showcasing Chinese themed imagery, from art works to films and documentaries. The digital art will be displayed at the Downtown Farmers’ Market, storefronts in North Chinatown and non-profits in South Chinatown. ● We are aware of 2 other Downtown Vibrancy Strategy grants being applied for, both related to gateways to Chinatown, one focused on the 97 Street Underpass and one on the Capital Tower. ● Adjacent project - Station Lands development - Approved Development Permit for 504 residential units across two towers. The site is located between 97 Street and 101 Street, south of 105 Avenue. CE ● C&E takes a supporting role (to UPE/IIS/CO/CS and other business areas) with this relationship — no direct projects, grants or programs to report. ● For the 311 Contact Centre, callers (requesting service or requiring information) can be served in the language of their choice using the language translation service (languages, which include East Asian and Indigenous languages, are listed here). ● The Intergovernmental Affairs team is advancing Council’s advocacy agency, many of those advocacy items (if successful) should help to alleviate pressure on Chinatown such as providing culturally-appropriate supports for Indigenous peoples, ending drug poisoning, ending homelessness, etc. The efforts of other Communications teams like social media and storytelling amplify these needs. Examples include drug poisioning and National Housing Day. ● C&E supports the sister city relationship between Harbin and Edmonton. The most visible outcome of the relationship was the Harbin Gate located at the entrance of Chinatown. See IIS for further information.","No",,,

I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide the following information: Inquiry Response Assumptions used for CSWB, including to develop the business cases With the Strategy intended to be City-led but community driven, Administration engaged in numerous conversations with community stakeholders as part of the framework and business case development, including but not limited to using the Safer for All recommendations as a foundational informative source along with other approved City and partner strategies and initiatives. The change narratives, logic models and GBA+ work took into consideration diverse, intersecting factors that could impact how communities who are marginalized understand and experience government initiatives. It was also assumed that as the Strategy is implemented, different pillars will have different needs at different times. Lastly, the business cases were also developed with a view to ensuring the money allocated could be spent in 2022. Roadmap that includes gaps and overlaps in the ecosystem Change narratives were used to help inform the CSWB Strategy and implementation will include further analysis of gaps and overlaps in collaboration with key partners. 1 What does the governance structure look like? Administration looked at developing a strategy before a governance structure was developed. This may require different governance structures including co-collaboration for certain pillars. Administration has developed a document that outlines our definition of ‘Create,’ circumstances where it is currently used, considerations for its use, conditions for its successful use, and next steps to ensure the best use of this approach for public engagement into the future. This document will inform current areas where co-collaboration takes place and will guide Council on where it’s an appropriate engagement practice. This document will be shared with City Council in the next few weeks. How does CSWB tie into COVID recovery? During the pandemic, people experiencing homelessness in Edmonton grew by 50 per cent. A large, long-term homeless encampment and pressure on shelters/shelter spaces overwhelmed the system. Being prepared for future events by addressing root causes of homelessness while also providing an enhanced ability to triage via the actions outlined in the CSWB Strategy will help ensure gains made during the COVID-19 recovery are secured. In addition, many of the CSWB Strategy action items will address current vibrancy and safety concerns (transit safety, overdose response, greater support for those in need of social services, appropriate dispatch of services to those in need) in core communities, particularly Downtown. What can Edmontonians do/how can they participate in the plan? The Community Safety and Well-being Strategy intentionally puts community and community members at the center of its model and the seven interconnected pillars that make up the strategy (Anti-racism; Reconciliation; Safe and Inclusive Spaces; Equitable Policies, Procedures, Standards and Guidelines; Pathways In and Out of Poverty; Crime Prevention and Crisis Intervention; and Well-being). In order to progress towards outcomes, it is important each person making Edmonton home sees how they can contribute to the strategy, its pillars, initiatives and action plans. The City finds it important for anyone wanting to champion CSWB in their communities that they feel they can do so. Here are some of the things we can encourage Edmontonians to do: 1. Education and building awareness in this work are key. It is really important to educate ourselves about these issues, how they impact our communities and individuals in our city. Learning about the root causes of these problems in our society, the historical basis of why we are where we are is vital to understand the contemporary manifestations of historical and systemic barriers in our society and systems today. 2. Self-reflection: this is tied to the previous point but 2 delves deep","evious point but 2 delves deeper into ourselves, we turn inwards to think about our own biases.There are many assumptions and stereotypes that often bias work and policy making processes. We look at our own practices, beliefs, and also the communities and organizations we are part of to reflect on how we have been doing things, on how we have developed our policies and practices over time. Are there ways to shift things to be more inclusive of various marginalized experiences? Are there ways to do things differently to make sure everyone in our community feels included and like they belong? Are we creating spaces to include equity seeking communities and individuals in our organizations, our boards and decision making tables? 3. Allyship: Education and self-reflection are necessary to begin this work, but active steps are needed for meaningful change in removing systemic barriers and creating a society where marginalized people thrive. We need to practice true allyship by learning how to listen, learn, and amplify the voices and initiatives from marginalized communities. We can practice true allyship by challenging our family and friends around misconceptions related to marginalized experiences. We can contribute to the education and awareness raising within our own communities, organizations, and close circles. We can create spaces for marginalized voices to be at the decision making tables in our organizations and communities, and establish evaluation and accountability mechanisms to ensure commitment. We can amplify the existing community initiatives and create solidarity networks to challenge systemic barriers through an intersectional understanding of the problems and marginalized experiences. We can be engaged bystanders and intervene with safe measures in a situation to disrupt behaviour that harms equity deserving peoples. Finally, we can practice solidarity in our advocacy and relationships by recognizing that systemic barriers that impact one equity seeking group may also impact others and therefore solutions need an intersectional lens. 4. Please reach out to the City: It is important that diverse voices and experiences are heard in all seven pillars of the Framework. To all Edmontonians and those who call Edmonton home, please reach out to your councilors, The Mayor’s office, the City staff and the City Manager’s Office if you have further feedback, ideas, or would like to share your thoughts on the Community Safety and Well-Being strategy. We would like to hear from you and create the space for relationship building and listening and learning as 3 actions are developed for the Framework. Demonstrating true allyship starts with individual and collective initiatives and there is commitment from all leadership to thinking through all these points as part of this Framework and other initiatives linked to this work. Indigenous-led shelter proof of concept Administration has completed a jurisdictional scan of Indigenous-led shelter and programming initiatives, as well as the first phase of engagement with key stakeholders on what would be needed to develop and operate Indigenous-led shelters in Edmonton. The next phase of the project will go deeper with the engagement and research to gain further insights needed to inform and co-create the planning and design of any future Indigenous-led shelters and programming concepts. A report on Indigenous-led Shelters, Housing and Programming is going to CPSC on June 27, 2022. How much has been spent addressing/implementing the Safer for All recommendations and the cost of Safer for All Strategy (with respect to EPS funding towards implementing Safer for All Strategy) $480,000 was originally earmarked to support the Task Force with $180,000 absorbed by Community Services. Costs included recruitment of the task force by a third party firm, remuneration for task force members, external task force support resources (data and research compilation, communications and clerical support) and a 0.3 FTE temporary senior administrative staff to support project management. Unused funds were carried forward to CSWB funds held in Financial Strategies and allocated for CSWB Strategy business cases. Allocations made via Fall 2021 SOBA to REACH ($250,000), EndPovertyEdmonton ($2.1 million), and RECOVER ($250,000) also came out of recommendations from the Task Force. Impact on City budget re: dispatch Administration has defined the scope of dispatch (or 911) from calling 911 to dispatching one of the three emergency services (Police, Fire, or EMS). Alberta Health Services manages evaluating and dispatching of EMS calls. Calls into 911 are answered by EPS and dispatching of police resources are also handled by EPS. As such, EPS would need to provide additional budget details. Evaluating and dispatching Fire resources is done by Edmonton Fire Rescue Services and the budget is approximately $7 million, although efficiencies have not been factored into this number nor an OCT budget that will be required to support some of the technology. Administration is gathering additional details for City Council and will follow-up once the information is available. Can FCSS funding be used for prevention? Yes, the Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) is an 80/20 funding partnership between the Government of Alberta and participating municipalities designed to fund preventive social services. FCSS has dedicated resources 4 for primary (universal) and secondary (targeted to a specific demographic, community) prevention, focused on early actions in order to prevent escalation and the need for intervention/rehabilitative services. The program funds $20 million to Edmonton non-profits, as well as partnerships, research and educational opportunities that align with the seven pillars of the Community Safety and Well-being Framework. FCSS funding priorities are: ● Positive Mental Health ● Healthy Relationships ● Poverty Reduction & Homelessness Prevention ● Healthy Social Emotional Development The application process for 2023-25 is currently underway with assessments of applications being completed now. FCSS Committee and CSAB expect to have recommendations finalized in June and plan to notify groups so they can prepare for 2023. Additional details are in the attachment: FCSS Preventative Funding Aligned to CSWB Framework How will the strategy build out an approach to expand operational hours for social support, crisis diversion, mental health teams, etc? The CSWB Strategy encompasses priority bodies of work that address access to services and support such as social support, the 24/7 crisis diversion work, enhancing collaboration around mental health and suicide prevention. Innovative approaches like the Integrated Call Evaluation & Dispatch Centre will change how systems currently operate and respond. Administration advised the Community and Public Services Committee on May 16, 2022 that resources to support these areas may need to be considered. As the strategy’s implementation plan is formalized, Administration will look for continued opportunities to enhance and extend programs and services that are positively impacting Edmontonians safety and well-being. An example of this includes City Council approving the allocation of $1.8 million in one-time funding for the continued provision of day services at Bissell Centre Community Space. Administration will also continue to advocate that the Province accepts the City’s minimum shelter standards. Is there the possibility of federal or provincial funding related to the implementation of the Indigenous Framework? The current funding for the implementation is related to the creation of internal FTEs to support the corporate wide adoption of the framework, thus federal and provincial funding would not be available for that. However, advancing projects related to the framework, MMIWG2S+ and reconciliation may enable access to federal and provincial grants. Typically, this is done through partnerships with community organizations. Some examples include that the Federal budget outlined $10.6 billion over six years dedicated to the advancement 5 of reconciliation and to continue to support Indigenous peoples and communities. As part of the federal government’s 2021 promise, $2.2 billion over five years has been dedicated to respond to the tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Further, the Edmonton 2 Spirit Society was recently successful in receiving approximately $500,000 to end violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+, while the Alberta Native Friendship Centres Association received $200,000 to provide local community support to women and families who have been affected by violence. The City along with our community partners will continue to monitor as new funding programs from other orders of government get launched. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize that City staff value the robust discussions at Committee and Council. We have captured the feedback, including opportunities to adjust the Framework pillars, including adding Children’s Services, Justice, and economic discrimination to Pathways In and Out of Poverty. We will also ensure that various perspectives will inform the implementation plan including youth, programs and early intervention, as well as partners including EFCL and the Chinatown BIA. Partners and community were also clear that they wanted scalable outreach/enforcement, enhanced Peace Officer Training, and that they endorsed the COTT model. Should you have any questions please let me know. Council will also be provided with regular updates until we have the dashboard ready. AC/tl Attachment: FCSS Preventative Funding Aligned to CSWB Framework 6 FCSS preventive funding aligned to CSWB Pillars Summary ● FCSS funds preventive social services ● A quick alignment exercise has taken place to identify what pillar existing programs would align with. ● Many programs contribute to multiple pillars, some examples: programs led by ethnocultural community inherently contribute to anti racism efforts; Indigenous led organizations inherently contribute to reconciliation efforts; and support for homeless youth/youth in crisis inherently has an element of crime-prevention and/or crisis intervention, even when activities funded are preventive in nature (and/or youth not in crisis or homeless also attend programs) ● FCSS funded programs are all supported in the process of becoming truly equitable and inclusive in their governance, operations and programming ● Agencies funded by FCSS for 2023 and beyond are assessed for equity and intersectionality 1 Anti-racism Agency Program Name Funded Amount Multicultural Family Resource Society Family and Youth Programs in Immigrant & Refugee Communities $227,225.00 Multicultural Family Resource Society Building Anti-Racism and Equity into Community Program and Services $50,000.00 Reconciliation Agency Program Name Funded Amount Bent Arrow Traditional Healing Society Practise as Ceremony $650,000.00 Safe and Inclusive Spaces Agency Program Name Funded Amount Aboriginal Counseling Services Association of Alberta Circle of Safety Family Violence 61,602.00 Catholic Social Services Elder Abuse Resource & Supports 75,599.00 Council for the Advancement of African Canadians in Alberta Youth Resilience Building Program (formerly called - Youth Leadership Training and Mentorship) 200,000.00 Edmonton Immigrant Services Association New Neighbours 159,632.00 Edmonton Multicultural Coalition Association All Together Now 167,691.00 Family Centre of Northern Alberta (Association), The Roots & Wings 730,562.00 Free Play for Kids Inc.

Administration executed a grant agreement with the Edmonton Arts Council for the full amount, which is being utilized to launch the Arts Presentation Fund for COVID Recovery program. Opening on May 1, 2022 applications from presenters will be accepted for grants of between $500 and $10,000 per applicant, for compensating local artists at professional rates for performances or presentations in Edmonton. The program will continue on an ongoing basis until November 1, 2022, or until the available budget has been committed. In the spirit of the Council, award of the $1.2 million grants will be available to presenters, including arts organizations, festivals, restaurants, community leagues and other live venues for the sole purpose of compensating artists that reside in Edmonton and its neighbouring areas, for performances or presentations made in the City. These funds are to support artist fees and payments related to presentation and performance; to encourage downtown revitalization, and neighbourhood vibrancy; to provide opportunities for artists from equity seeking groups; and to aid in Edmonton's economic recovery from COVID-19. Through the funding agreement, $1.05 million will be allocated in its entirety to the Arts Presentation Fund for COVID Recovery program, and up to $150,000 will be awarded in its entirety to artists, directly by the Edmonton Arts Council as part of ongoing programming.

It reflects Edmontonians’ hopes for their future city — a city that has the benefits we enjoy today with new opportunities for the future. Though The City Plan comes from Edmontonians, not all Edmontonians understand how The City Plan will change the way they experience their city. To help bring people along on the journey and better understand why and how the City is changing its planning practices, Administration is launching the City’s first-ever podcast series, Making Space. The podcast explores how people engage with land and development. It will encourage Edmontonians to consider how the City’s plans, policies and regulations shape experiences and the urban environment. The episodes take conversations out of the recording studio and into the streets and neighbourhoods where the rubber of policy meets the road. There are five episodes, each featuring stories of actual people and communities whose lives have been impacted by how we plan our cities. The episodes are: 1. The Million Dollar Parking Lot , featuring Carola Cunningham, CEO, Niginan Housing Ventures; Lyla Peter, Director, Development Approvals and Inspections, City of Edmonton 2. Whose Home? , featuring Susan McGee, CEO, Homeward Trust; Colton Kirsop, former Manager for Project Development, Housing and Homelessness, City of Edmonton 3. At Your Discretion , featuring Chris Hoit, owner, A1 Pawn; Katherine Pihooja, Planner II, Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative, City of Edmonton 1 / 2 4. Connecting the Dots , featuring Cherie Klassen, Executive Director, Old Strathcona Business Association; Michael Strong, Senior Planner, District Planning, City of Edmonton 5. What Does Better Look Like? , featuring Chris Dulaba, Placemaker, Beljan Development Corporation Making Space will launch its first episode on Tuesday, May 31, and new episodes will be released every following Tuesday until June 28. The series will be available on Transforming Edmonton and on all major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple and Google. Following the last podcast release, a panel and wrap-up event will be held at the Oliver Exchange Building. The panel will feature individuals who participated in the podcast as well as community and industry members. An invitation to Council will be sent separately. Council members will receive the podcast episode every Monday prior to the episode's anticipated release, along with a promotional package which will include suggested social posts. The podcast series will hopefully inspire all Edmontonians to learn more about The City Plan and to participate in the Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative and District Planning’s upcoming engagements, which are scheduled for this summer and fall.

This is to inform Councilors of the approach and timelines associated with public engagement related to this initiative. “Mass Transit: Implementation for 1.25 million People” continues the planning work required to implement the mass transit network in support of the City Plan. ETS currently provides a broad range of transit services delivered through both buses and LRT. Currently, only the LRT network is considered part of the mass transit network. There is an opportunity to develop a more comprehensive, city-wide mass transit network by adding other forms of mass transit (mainly bus-based) to the existing LRT network. A focus of this project will be implementing semi-exclusive mass transit routes, which is a type of infrastructure and service that will be new to Edmonton. The engagement approach for the project will align with the digital-first approach outlined by the City of Edmonton’s Engagement and Communications department, with in-person events supporting outreach to hard-to reach populations or when on-site feedback is required. The project team is also working closely with other projects, including the Old Strathcona Public Realm Strategy, District Planning and outreach by Edmonton Transit, to ensure alignment and minimize overlap. The project team is also coordinating with the Edmonton Metropolitan Transit Services Commission regarding upcoming engagement on regional transit. The project will ultimately include two rounds of public engagement. The first round of engagement activities for public participation are anticipated to occur in June. The primary focuses will be to update people about the work completed so far, including sharing the mass transit network for 1.25 million people (the network map shared with Urban Planning Committee and City Council in February 2022, plus revisions as advised by Committee and Council) and providing the public with an opportunity to share feedback about their values and expectations for mass transit in the future. The first round of engagement will also be used to share different types of bus and rail-based mass transit and their appropriateness in different urban contexts. The role of the public in the first round of engagement will be to advise . The second round of engagement is scheduled in October/November. The primary focus will be to review specific candidate corridors for dedicated transit lanes and explore the tradeoffs that come with rethinking the space on our streets. This feedback will serve as an input in shaping the route alignment and corridor design evaluation process. The role of the public in the second round of engagement will be to refine . If there are any questions or inquiries about upcoming engagement activities, please visit the project website www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/mass-transit-planning-popul ation-growth or reach out to the Planning and Environment Services Branch Manager’s Office at upepesobm@edmonton.ca .

The system will serve multimodal transit systems in Edmonton, Strathcona County, and the City of St. Albert. The system design also allows for expansion to additional regional transit systems in the future. The system will encourage more transit ridership by substantially increasing customer convenience. Some key features and benefits of the system for customers include: ● Cashless travel; eliminating the need for exact change. ● Accepting Credit and Debit cards right on transit vehicles and at light rail stations. ● Online account management. ● Autoload feature to ensure funds are always available in personal transit accounts. ● Wide range of retail locations to obtain and reload accounts. ● Ability to ride multiple regional transit systems with a single account. ● Streamline the management of fare programs such as Upass and employee pass programs Some key features and benefits of the system for transit agencies include: ● Enabling progressive fare policies, such as fare capping and distance or zone based fares. ● Delivering more detailed ridership information to better plan services for customers. ● Reducing bus operator involvement in fare disputes ● Reducing lost revenue from fraudulent paper fare products ● Reducing cash handling and printing of paper passes and tickets. Over the next year, Vix Technology will work with a dedicated team of professionals from each municipal transit agency to design the Regional Smart Fare System (RSFS). Once the design is finalized and approved, Vix Technology will begin the development of various software systems. They will also be responsible for the installation of new equipment on buses, LRT stations, and terminals. Pilot trials of the system are planned for 2019, with full system rollout in 2020. Vix Technology also has the contract to operate and maintain the system for a 12 year period after full system implementation. The total capital budget for the entire program is $51.6 million, and includes: ● The installation of Smart Bus, the enabling communications infrastructure on buses, for the Strathcona County and St. Albert bus fleets. Installation of Smart Bus equipment on a portion of Edmonton’s bus fleet was also funded through this program. In addition to supporting the electronic fare payment system, Smart Bus delivers additional benefits, such as: ○ Operational control and efficiency ○ Driver/Passenger safety ○ Real-time bus tracking information ● Integration of regional bus stops, schedules, and maps. ● Research and development of a new regional fare policy. ● Development of a fully functioning test lab. ● IT software interfaces and network security enhancements. ● Project and program management. ● Modifications at bus terminals and LRT stations to support new fare equipment. ● Building a state of the art secure website that supports phones, tablets, and computers. ● Establish a regional retail network where customers can obtain and reload accounts. ● Build interfaces to institutional, educational, and employer programs. ● Establish a regional customer service center to distribute cards and manage customer service. ● Branding, marketing, communications, and customer engagement. Project Funding: ● Province of Alberta $28.1M (GreenTRIP funding) ● City of Edmonton $18.8M ● City of St. Albert $2.2M ● Strathcona County $2.5M Any additional questions concerning the Regional Smart Fare and Smart Bus Program should be directed to Tarra Kongsrude (Tarra.Kongsrude@Edmonton.ca).",,"No",,,

Anti-icer is a calcium chloride solution with an added corrosion inhibitor. It is applied in a thin layer to roadways before and sometimes during a snowfall. The product prevents the snow from sticking to the pavement, helping the roads to stay clear longer. It reduces the need for plowing and sanding. Last winter, it was applied to select arterial roads, including St. Albert Trail, Yellowhead Trail, Gateway Boulevard and Calgary Trail. The product was used in small quantities once per snow event, before the snow fell. The results of this pilot aligned with our expectations, and with results in other North American cities that use this type of product. Treated lanes stayed bare longer, road surface friction increased and stopping distances were reduced. This year, the pilot will be expanded, although the exact locations have yet to be determined. We have already established the product’s efficacy; this year’s pilot will focus on building our expertise to ensure we are using the product to maximum effectiveness. This includes developing processes, training our people and continually monitoring weather patterns. We will begin slowly, ensuring we have a solid understanding of how the product will work on our roads, before we begin to apply the product on a broader scale. There has been some recent concern about the potential corrosive effects of the anti-icing product on vehicles. Comparisons have been drawn to Eastern Canada, where many municipalities use coarse sodium chloride rock salt, which has a relatively high measured corrosion rate. In contrast, the City of Edmonton will use a liquid calcium chloride solution with an added corrosion inhibitor which studies have shown to be anywhere from 60% to 85% less corrosive than traditional sodium chloride road salt. When compared to the amount of sodium chloride road salt that has been mixed into the sand that has been used on Edmonton streets for many years and given that we expect that the quantities of products used to be minimized vs past experience, we do not expect any significant difference in corrosion rates. These effects will be fully examined during the 2017-18 winter season and reported to council at the conclusion of the pilot. This linked video provides additional information about the calcium chloride product and its benefits. Citizens have also voiced concern about the potential negative effects anti-icing could have on the environment. Calcium chloride has less of a negative impact on vegetation than sodium chloride. Calibrated, automatic spreaders can reduce unnecessary salt application, and we will continue to work with Drainage Services and EPCOR to assess and monitor the amounts of chlorides going into the storm water sewers. Enquiries had been made about the effectiveness of winter tires when compared to all-season tires and efforts to achieve bare pavement. A recent review by Consumer Reports, as illustrated below, clearly shows how road conditions affect safety. Bare pavement, as being tested with this pilot, poses significantly less risk than snow-covered pavement when using either all-season or winter tires. We will examine all factors -- financial, safety and environmental, as well as the impact to infrastructure and vehicles -- to help determine when anti-icer is the most appropriate product to use. However, we are confident that the product will help us achieve a better bare-pavement condition to help improve both mobility and safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. In spring 2018, we will conduct city-wide public engagement sessions to give citizens an opportunity to share their thoughts on proposed changes to the snow and ice policy, including the use of anti-icer. This feedback will be considered before any policy changes are brought forward to council.",,"No",,,

At that time, the project was put on hold as a result of feedback received from City Council, the Accessibility Advisory Committee (AAC) and placard holders. This memo provides an update on progress on key actions and next steps. Key Actions Update Based on feedback received, Administration identified three key actions to address concerns raised regarding implications of the VLPR roll out of curbside accessible parking. Below is an update of these actions. 1. Evaluate the current network of curbside designated accessible stalls and assess opportunities for the addition of new stalls or modification of existing stalls by mid-September. Administration has identified potential new designated accessible stall locations within the existing EPark network in Downtown, 124 Street and Old Strathcona. These potential additions will be assessed for their ability to meet road and sidewalk design guidelines, the Age-Friendly Edmonton Access Design Guide, and the needs of placard holders . In collaboration with the AAC, Administration will use feedback gained through upcoming public engagement activities to aid in this assessment process and the final determination of new stall installations. Administration is currently reviewing the location, safety and curbside accessibility of existing designated accessible stalls throughout the city to ensure the stall network enhances the experience for its users. 2. Develop a management and technology solution that will continue to allow courtesy parking in curbside EPark zones for recipients of the Provincial Parking Placard for People with Disabilities. Administration is currently evaluating options for the management of continued two hour courtesy parking for vehicles with placards in EPark zones. This evaluation includes compiling estimates for program administration and FTE costs, as well as the cost of developing or obtaining technology solutions. Citizen Journey Mapping will provide Administration with a deeper understanding of the experiences of a variety of sub-groups who currently use parking placards. Results from the Citizen Journey Mapping exercise will help to further refine management and technology solution recommendations. 3. Develop and deploy, in collaboration with the Accessibility Advisory Committee, a Public Engagement Plan to gain additional insight on stall locations and experiences related to accessible parking. Through upcoming public engagement activities, Administration will hear directly from people with accessibility placards and business owners about their needs and vision for curbside designated accessible parking. During October and November, Administration will: ● Participate in six ‘Engage Edmonton’ events hosted by the City of Edmonton ● Facilitate an engagement workshop with the AAC on October 15, 2018 ● Conduct an online survey ● Host a series of focus group sessions with accessible parking placard holders ● Conduct Citizen Journey Mapping of placard holder sub-groups Through the above activities, shortlisted solutions will be tested and validated. The results of this work will inform Administration’s next steps to managing accessible parking and, in turn, the implementation of automated parking enforcement technology. While work on the three key actions is underway, accessible parking placard holders will continue to use curbside EPark zones free of charge. The engagement results will be reviewed with the AAC in Q1 2019, followed by an update to Council with Administration’s findings in Q2 2019. Phased Automated Enforcement Implementation - Parkade Facilities As work continues on the three key actions identified above for managing curbside accessible parking, Administration plans to roll out Vehicle Licence Plate Recognition (VLPR) in Q1 2019 at City owned/leased parkade facilities (City Hall, Library Parkade, and Canada Place). Stationary cameras mounted at the parkade entrances and exits will capture vehicle licence plate images and record the length of the parking session. Vehicles that incur a violation will receive a ticket in the mail, similar to the speed photo enforcement process. The VLPR roll out will have no impact on the curbside accessible parking project work because accessible parking has historically required payment in off-street facilities.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2017, as part of the Glenora Historic Resources Inventory project. Built in 1950, the Warren Residence's heritage value resides in its association with Glenora’s explosive post-war settlement period to the north of Stony Plain Road. The portion of Glenora north of Stony Plain Road was surveyed in 1906 by Montreal real estate developer James Carruthers. He later surveyed the southern portion in 1911 with the goal of establishing an upscale neighbourhood inspired by the Garden City Suburb Movement, emphasizing garden space, walkability and streetscapes that followed the natural contours of the landscape. The southern portion of the neighbourhood slowly built out with regal homes owned by business professionals and the City's governing elites. The area north of Stony Plain Road would remain undeveloped until the post-WWII era where a population boom in the city created a surging demand for housing. While these newer developments borrowed the large setbacks of “Old Glenora,” most homes were smaller and more modest in design, intended for middle-class families entering the housing market. The Warren Residence is a good example of this period of development with its large setback, mature landscaping, and modest single storey massing. It references Modern Bungalow design, with single material cladding, large picture windows, and a low-pitched roofline. Modern-style houses could also be built quickly and they spread throughout the 1940s to meet with the increased demand for single family housing. The first owners of the residence were George and Joyce Warren. They occupied the residence from 1950 to 1964 while George worked as the Manager of the Safety Supply Company. Herman (1905-1969) and Jean (1902-1986) Siemens became the new owners in 1965. Both were active in the Northern Alberta Pioneers and Old Timers Association, where Herman served as president in 1960. Herman was the Director of Industrial Health Services for six years until his retirement in 1968, while Jean worked as a school teacher. Following Herman's death in 1969, Jean continued to live in the residence until 1974. The property is zoned (RF1) Low Density Residential Zone. The owner has applied to develop a new single detached dwelling and detached garage on the subject site. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent.

More than 9,300 people have signed as of Monday evening and the number is climbing quite quickly. However, details surrounding the death have not yet been confirmed publicly by any authority, and investigation actions are preliminary. City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton is aware of the petition, and looking into the matter. Key Messages: ● The City is aware of the petition, and troubled by its allegations. We are seeking additional information from authorities and bar owners. ● The City is saddened to hear of this person’s passing, and we await information from medical and other authorities as their investigations proceed. ● The City takes citizen concerns about public safety seriously and will follow the appropriate processes within its jurisdiction. ● The City will support the AGLC in its investigation and any subsequent processes. Approach : At the moment, Administration is gathering additional information in collaboration with AGLC, and will not proactively comment until further information is available. Once more information is available, the City of Edmonton will undertake whatever steps may be required/available to support the safety of nighttime establishment patrons and venues. Background: Almost a year to the day, on November 20 2017, there was another death connected to a patron of this establishment, deemed non-criminal by EPS. The City of Edmonton is a sponsor of the Best Bar None Program and has provided support for the event for several years. An awards ceremony is planned for the evening of November 20, 2018. Councillor McKeen and several other City staff will be attending and speaking at the event. Media are invited to the event, as they are every year. Currently, Councillor McKeen’s speaking notes for the Best Bar None event will generally allude to the news and reinforce the City’s commitment to safety: “Unfortunately, as recent events have reminded us, there are many factors that can cause a night out to take a more serious turn. So now, more than ever, it’s important that we redouble our efforts to ensure nightlife in our city is safe for everyone."" Media coverage: AGLC has confirmed to CTV that it is investigating. CTV reports that Edmonton Police Service indicates it is not considering the death suspicious, nor investigating any further. Coverage: CTV , CBC .

Identified in the City's proposed 2019-2022 Capital Budget as a transformational project, the freeway conversion will upgrade Yellowhead Trail to improve the safety, operational capacity and level of service for this key inter-city, inter-regional and inter-provincial goods movement corridor. The Program includes a number of projects in support of upgrading Yellowhead Trail to a freeway. The Yellowhead Trail freeway will consist of six core lanes with a target operating speed of 80 km/hr. The Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion Program has a budget of approximately $1 billion. Program Update - Overview ● Concept Planning for the Yellowhead Trail / 66 Street intersection is underway and scheduled to be complete by the end of 2019. Public engagement events will begin early in 2019. ● Concept Planning of the St. Albert Trail to 97 Street portion, which includes the interchanges at 127 Street and 121 Street, is anticipated to begin in spring of 2019. ● Preliminary Design of 123 Avenue (156 Street to 142 Street) and the Yellowhead Trail Widening (west of 50 Street to the North Saskatchewan River) projects will begin early in 2019 . ● Detailed Design is ongoing in anticipation of 2019 construction for the following locations; ○ 128 Avenue (St. Albert Trail to 156 Street) ○ 124 Avenue (142 Street to 149 Street) ○ 125A Avenue (82 Street to 97 Street) including the removal of the 89 Street traffic signal ● Major construction on the main corridor is anticipated to begin in the spring of 2020 with the widening of Yellowhead Trail from 50 Street to the North Saskatchewan River. Additional information regarding each of the projects is included in Attachment 1 . Project planning and design is scheduled to be complete by 2022 with construction anticipated to continue through to the end of 2026. A summary of the overall Program schedule is also provided as Attachment 2 . Public Awareness and Pre-Engagement Campaign From September to mid-November 2018, the Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion Program team reached out to people in Edmonton and across the region. The goal was to gauge awareness of the Program and gather input that will help the Program team make balanced and well-informed decisions about various projects, communications and engagement approaches. Feedback was collected through the following methods: ● 3,357 completed surveys ● 24 pop-up booths at locations throughout the metropolitan region including recreation centres, farmer's markets, the City's free admission day, and Engage Edmonton events ● Four focus groups with business owners and industrial property owners ● 23 interviews and meetings with organizations and associations including Business Improvement Areas (BIAs), Chamber of Commerce, Edmonton School Boards, NAIT and the Edmonton Police Service. ● 11 meetings with community leagues ● In total: 1,434 in-person conversations The feedback we heard will be used in planning and design considerations for each project and will also inform the development of communications and engagement activities. A ‘What We Heard’ report on our public awareness and pre-engagement campaign will be available online in January 2019. Public Engagement and Communications A newsletter updating the public of the Program’s progress will be distributed by email to subscribers and made available through the City’s website and social media. A copy of the newsletter is provided in Attachment 3. Land Acquisition To date 83 property interests have been initiated of which 36 interests have been acquired. Of the remaining 47 interests, negotiations are underway on 38 with 9 on hold pending additional planning considerations. The majority of these properties are located near 149 Street and Fort Road where concept planning is complete. As planning progresses for the 127 Street interchange and 121 Street interchange additional land acquisition requirements will be identified. To date, no expropriation has been required for any of the locations identified.

This policy will guide the development and implementation of City procedures towards civic engagement, programs and services, communications and technology, employee services and infrastructure (facilities, open spaces and transportation) to ensure full consideration of individual's needs and diverse abilities. According to the proposed Government of Canada Bill C-81: The Accessible Canada Act, currently one in seven Canadians have a disability. That number is expected to grow with an aging population. People with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed, to live in poverty and to earn less than people without a disability. These barriers continue to exist today and limit the social, political and economic inclusion of people with disabilities. Disability is defined in The (proposed) Accessible Canada Act as a physical, mental, intellectual, learning, communication or sensory impairment or functional limitation, whether permanent, temporary or episodic in nature, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equitable participation in society. Canadians all benefit from being able to fully participate and contribute to communities and workplaces without barriers. The City’s new and updated Accessibility for People with Disabilities Policy is intended to ensure all people are treated with respect, have equitable access, and opportunity to participate to the fullest extent in the city. Accessibility A concept integral to human rights that refers to the absence of barriers that prevent individuals and/or groups from fully participating in all social, economic, cultural, spiritual and political aspects of society. The term is often linked to people with 2 disabilities and their rights to access, and also refers to universal design characteristics of products, devices, information, programs, services, infrastructure that enable independent use, or support when required, and access by people with a variety of disabilities. Administration has been working closely with external Advisory Committees to research and demonstrate best practices in its ongoing work to date. Now it’s time to update the City policies to formally align with this work and the City’s 2019-2028 Strategic Plan for a healthy city, as well as to reflect current standards practiced nationally and internationally. This Policy development work includes reviewing and integrating the existing City policies that address accessibility: ● C463 Accessibility to City of Edmonton Owned and Occupied Buildings (Council approved in 1992) ● C466 Integration of Persons with Disabilities (Council approved in 1993) The new policy will also expand its scope further than buildings and integration of employees to include technology, information, communication, transportation, recreation, open spaces, engagement, programs and services. Public engagement is integral in this policy development work. Five drop-in sessions located across the city will provide people with an opportunity to provide their feedback and perspectives on a draft of the policy. In addition to the public sessions, a facilitated conversation with people with developmental disabilities has been arranged to support inclusive engagement. Public Engagement Sessions Date and Time Location February 26, 2019 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. West Edmonton Christian Assembly Church 6315 199 Street NW, Edmonton February 28, 2019 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Meadows Community Recreation Centre 2704 17 Street NW, Edmonton March 5, 2019 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Edmonton Tower 10111 104 Ave NW, Edmonton March 7, 2019 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Clareview Community Recreation Centre 3804 139 Ave NW, Edmonton March 13, 2019 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Terwillegar Community Recreation Centre 2051 Leger Road NW, Edmonton A separate engagement session will be hosted during the day on March 5, 2019 at Edmonton Tower to support City of Edmonton staff in providing their feedback. Staff are also welcome to attend the public sessions. Information about this work and an invitation to participate in the public engagement sessions will be shared broadly through various channels, and is available at edmonton.ca/accessibilitypolicy The final policy is scheduled to be brought forward for City Council consideration in Fall 2019. 3 Once the policy is final and approved, Administration w","ration will proceed with corporate directives and procedures to support staff in their day-to-day work.

Background In November 2016, City Council approved funding for three years for an interim civic services grant pilot program to provide funding of up to 50 percent of mandatory civic service costs to eligible organizations. The interim grant ran from 2016 to 2018. In September 2018, Administration presented the Festivals & Event Delivery Action Plan to City Council. The plan outlines seven strategic priorities and actions including festival and event funding model/mechanism, event classification, and City support to festivals and events. These strategic priorities and their accompanying strategic actions guide how City support to festivals and events is applied. As part of the 2019-2022 operating budget, City Council approved ongoing funding of $360,000 annually to provide eligible festivals with a 50 percent reduction towards eligible civic services costs (Civic Services Subsidy). This subsidy program replaced the interim Civic Services Grant pilot program. Based on the Festivals & Events Delivery Action Plan, festivals and events must be classified at the Signature or Foundational level to be considered eligible for this subsidy. Previously, during the 2016-2018 pilot, eligibility for the grant was tied to whether a festival or event received an Edmonton Arts Council grant. Event Classification Strategic Priority Two of the Festivals & Events Delivery Action Plan defined a set of event classifications to assist Administration in determining appropriate civic supports based on established criteria. The following provides each event classification description as defined in the plan and examples of some festivals and events classified at the various levels. ../3 - 2 - Mega Event These are “once in a generation” events that generate international interest and deliver considerable economic, social and reputational benefits to Edmonton, Alberta and Canada. These events typically require a bid process to attract. These large-scale, often multi-day events, may be hosted every 20 to 30 years in an existing indoor or outdoor space and may require some custom infrastructure. Attracting and bidding activities to bring this level of event to Edmonton would be strategically evaluated by a governance committee and approved by City Council as well as other orders of government. Examples include FIFA Men’s World Cup, Summer & Winter Olympics Major Event These events may come to Edmonton every three to 10 years and would attract an international and/or national audience. These events typically require a bid process to attract. They would be expected to deliver many economic, social and reputational benefits to Edmonton and Alberta. These large-scale events may be multi or single day and would likely be hosted in existing indoor or outdoor spaces. Similar to Mega events, attracting and bidding activities to bring these events to Edmonton would be strategically evaluated by a governance committee and approved by City Council. Examples include ITU Grand Final, FIFA Women’s World Cup, World Junior Hockey Championships, Commonwealth Games. Signature Festivals and Events These are annual or biennial festivals, events and parades that hold a national and some international profile and tourism draw for Edmonton and Alberta, deliver significant social benefits to our citizens and support the city’s economy. These events may require a bid process to attract or they may be locally grown. They align closely with civic priorities. The majority of these are high attendance, multi-day festivals and events that have been hosted in our community for many years and are produced by professional event producers. Examples include ITU World Triathlon Series, Heritage Festival, Edmonton Folk Music Festival, Edmonton International Fringe Festival, Edmonton Street Performers Festival, Silver Skate Festival, K-Days Parade & Festival. Foundational Festivals and Events / National Sporting Events These are annual or biennial existing or emerging festivals, events and parades that hold a regional and/or provincial profile and tourism draw for Edmonton, deliver social benefits to our citizens and some support to the city’s economy. The majority of these events have moderate attendance, are multi or single day festivals and events and are mainly produced by professional event producers.","t producers. This classification may include some national level sporting events. Examples include Flying Canoe Volant, Ice on Whyte, Cariwest Parade & Festival, Kaleido & Deep Freeze, Freewill Shakespeare in the Park, national-level sporting events. Niche Festivals and Events These are specialized and emerging one-time or recurring festivals, events and parades that hold a local, community or neigbourhood profile, encourage - 3 - community participation and align with civic priorities. These primarily single day events are usually smaller, homegrown and run by Edmonton based non-profits associations, volunteer groups, community leagues, etc. This classification includes local and provincial level sporting events. Examples include Sand on Whyte, UFest, Africanival, river valley runs and walks, fundraising events, provincial and local level sporting events, etc. A classification tool has been developed to ensure a consistent approach to classify events in one of the above categories. Classification identifies those events that are eligible for the Civic Services Subsidy (Signature and Foundational). Administration regularly reviews and adjusts the tool. Current criteria considers the following when classifying festivals and events: ● event recurrence (length of time the event has been in existence) / organizations capacity ● number of participants (performers, presenters, volunteers, spectators, etc.) ● tourism draw (local, national, and international interest) ● viewership (broadcast, media, and social media exposure) ● potential as an economic driver (economic impact, overall expenses, and revenue sources) ● civic pride, social impact, and community building ● corporate and council strategic alignment 124 Street Business Improvement Area - All is Bright Event Each year, the 124 Street Businesses hosts All is Bright, an annual community light-up event, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. on one Saturday in November. This event celebrates the winter season by bringing light to the community and includes live music, roving performers, firepits, light installations, craft and dancers, food trucks, and more. In 2018, All is Bright received an Interim Civic Services Grant that covered 50 percent of their eligible civic services as they had received an Edmonton Arts Council operating grant that year. In 2019, the event was not eligible to receive the new Civic Services Subsidy based on the criteria outlined in the Festival & Event Delivery Action Plan as the event is classified as a Niche Event. As the All is Bright event grows, the classification will be reviewed.

The City is striving to improve our service levels and find better ways to deliver our services to our partners. With this in mind, there was a recent story by the Edmonton Journal about the conversion of the former Enbridge Tower to a Hyatt Hotel, and the delays they are experiencing in getting the hotel opened. The owner of the building said that the project is delayed from its original timeline by about three months while applying for development and building permits from the City of Edmonton. The following information details the general background behind this situation and the next steps for moving this specific application forward. General ● The City of Edmonton reviews all development permit applications and during that process it’s common for the City to identify things in the original application that need to be addressed. Applications are reviewed to ensure they meet all safety regulations, design and other considerations such as how the development impacts transportation routes. ● In this case, a development permit application was received and several items needed to be addressed, including the impacts of the development on adjacent roadways. When changes like this are needed, it can take the applicant some time to explore viable options to address concerns, decide which path they wish to pursue, and then re-submit an updated application to the City. ● No building permit application has been submitted. ● City staff have been communicating with the applicant (the architect on the project) however, the owner may not have been aware of what was required. Next Steps ● A discussion took place with the applicant who confirmed a revised development permit application, including updated plans, still needed to be provided. The applicant is targeting to submit application details within the next week. ● The applicant also noted that it has taken longer than they expected as they encountered some challenges with the built form of the building and reconstruction required to repurpose the building. ● The team will be scheduling a meeting with the owner and the applicant to discuss this process, ensure everyone is aware of what has occurred, and to understand the next steps in obtaining approvals. ● The safety codes and development and zoning teams are ready to process the application as appropriate with the goal to help get the project completed within expected timelines. ● We will continue to work with the applicant to advance the project.

This memo and the attached report contain information on the successes and challenges in the first year of operation. The 100 Street Funicular opened to the public on December 7, 2017. Since opening, the funicular has become a landmark while also improving access to the river valley. While the funicular is the prominent feature of the site, the project also included the development of stairs, viewpoints, pedestrian bridge, artwork and an elevator. First Year of Operation The funicular and elevator are open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, which generally aligns with other amenity hours in the river valley while the surrounding park site is open during standard park hours, 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. As of November 25, 2018, the funicular had made 114,038 trips, either up or down the track. Staff recorded as many as 135 passengers using the funicular in an hour and as many as 28 trips in an hour. Throughout the first year of operation, there were some disruptions to these hours of operation as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance and repair activities as well as user and system errors. There has been some negative publicity during times when the funicular has not been operating. As previously noted in the November 9 memo, enhancement work scheduled for the end of December was completed and has improved the operations, safety and accessibility of the funicular and site. The original projected annual operating budget for the project was approximately $480,000 to $960,000, which was between 2 to 4 percent of the total project cost. During the first year of operation, the total operating cost for the funicular and site was $716,468, which is 3 percent of the total project cost. These costs include utilities, maintenance and operations. Public Engagement Results Over the last year, Administration collected and listened to the public’s feedback via 311, social media and through market research conducted over the last several months. To help the City understand perceptions and opinions around the funicular, Banister Research conducted a phone survey with 400 Edmontonians, an on-site survey with 182 users of the funicular, and an online survey with 2,206 responses. Key findings include: ● The funicular has helped cyclists and individuals with disabilities access the river valley and downtown. ● Overall perceptions of the funicular are moderate to positive; however, some respondents expressed negative feedback. ● Edmontonians and visitors see the funicular as a destination attraction. ● Satisfaction among users is quite high. ● The biggest area for improvement is overall maintenance and lighting. Over the next year, Administration will continue to proactively manage the funicular, engage with citizens, and explore opportunities to increase operational efficiencies. Attached you will find a comprehensive report regarding the results of the first year of operation. Administration is working to release the attached report to the public in the upcoming weeks.

The EAB determined that the Director’s decision to issue Emergency Enforcement Orders was “incorrect and unreasonable”, and that “more work needs to be done, but it is not an emergency”. In cancelling the Emergency Enforcement Orders, the Minister issued in their place two new Environmental Protection Orders outlining a detailed timeline of actions for Cherokee Canada Inc. (CCI) and Domtar to complete within the next year. The requirements involve delineation of the contamination, and the implementation of measures to remediate or prevent exposure to contaminants of concern. The City of Edmonton is not named in either of the two new Environmental Protection Orders. However, the new orders do compel Cherokee Canada Inc. and Domtar to take action on the City-owned Greenbelt and Verte Homesteader Park. This decision does not change the release of information by Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services last week. City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton will continue to work collaboratively with the Province and the other parties involved in this matter to ensure the safety of its residents and a timely resolution to this matter. Key Messages: ● Our primary focus is to ensure the health and safety of residents in the affected community. The City has followed, and will continue to follow, the Province’s environmental and health recommendations and requirements for this site and the surrounding area. ● The City, as the landowner of the Greenbelt and the park in Parcel C, will work with the Province and other parties to ensure appropriate measures are taken to satisfy any safety concerns. ● The fences around the Greenbelt and park site in Parcel C will remain in place. The City will update residents if those plans change. Approach : Communications will arrange an interview if media outlets call the City looking for information. Background: While the previous Emergency Enforcement Orders covered Parcels, X, Y, the Greenbelt and the Parcel C Berm, the two new Environmental Protection orders also include the developed portion of Parcel C. Unlike the Emergency Enforcement Orders, full and immediate removal of contaminated material (including the Parcel C/Y berm) will not be required, but rather a plan is to be developed to ensure that any contamination poses no unacceptable risk to human or environmental health. In the new orders, Cherokee Canada Inc. and Domtar are to immediately begin taking steps to manage dust control (within 7 days), delineate the contamination (within 150 days), complete a conceptual site model of the sampling results (180 days), conduct a further human health risk assessment (210 days) and complete site specific risk assessments (210 days). Based on the human health risk assessment, the conceptual model, and the site-specific risk assessment, Cherokee Canada Inc. and Domtar are to develop and carry out site specific risk management and remediation plans. These plans are required to be approved by the Approvals Director of Alberta Environment and the Provincial Chief Scientist. The new orders also direct Cherokee Canada Inc. and Domtar to keep the neighbourhood apprised on all activities on a bi-monthly basis. The Alberta Health Order, which is still in place, required that fences be put up around open spaces to protect public health. In compliance with that order, the City erected a fence around the Greenbelt to restrict access. It will remain in place until Alberta Health indicates that it can be taken down. The City is involved in its role as the regulatory body for land development and the legal landowner of the Greenbelt and park in Parcel C. The City accepted an application from Cherokee Canada Inc. for Parcel Y on September 21, 2015, requesting rezoning to a mix of residential and related zones. Administration required further information to be submitted prior to advancing and supporting the September 21, 2015 rezoning application. The City has communicated to the developer the requirements to determine site suitability prior to rezoning and those requirements have not changed. Since March 14, 2018 when the original Emergency Enforcement Orders were issued, the City has not advanced the rezoning on Parcel Y, nor has it advanced two add","vanced two additional rezoning applications on Parcel C. The City will examine what approach to take on these and other potential applications as the work directed in the Minister’s new orders takes place.

Eng., Deputy City Manager","Response to Anonymous Employee Letter",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-aoDXXLiC4jiny349XRC-L08CS8LBths)","We understand you have received a letter from a group of Parks and Roads Services employees. They also sent a similar letter to a local media outlet. Understanding that this letter may raise some questions or concerns about our winter road maintenance practices, we wish to provide you with a response . Winter road maintenance is one of the core functions of the City of Edmonton and is central to our commitment to maintaining a safe and reliable transportation network for Edmontonians - whether they are travelling in a vehicle, on a bike lane or a sidewalk. Over the past decade, we have seen significant changes to Edmonton’s weather patterns, including more freeze-thaw cycles and more freezing rain. This past winter, for example, has been the coldest since 1979 and we in fact put more sand down in February than we did during the same period last year. The winter season was also marked by dramatic swings in temperatures and conditions throughout the season. These changes have required Edmonton to pilot alternative approaches to effectively ensure safe and reliable transportation networks. The focus of our winter road maintenance is to support Vision Zero’s goal of safe travel. We achieve this by removing snow and ice from roads, bike lanes, bus shelters and bus stops, and public sidewalks using any number of tools - including sand, plows, salt, chip and anti-icer brine. Simply put, our focus is on ensuring the right tool is used in order to reach bare pavement conditions as quickly as possible. Bare pavement remains the safest condition for commuters. This approach is based on extensive and ongoing research into best practices across Alberta and other North American jurisdictions, as well as a review of existing research on snow and ice control techniques. Every tool we use for snow and ice control aims to create safe conditions first, while balancing environmental and other impacts. This is why we are conducting a thorough review of the impact of our snow and ice program on our environment, infrastructure and vehicles. Once we have completed our research on the pilot, we will report back to Council in June. We recognize that any change in work, habits or practice can be hard for some employees. We are disappointed when employees choose to raise concerns publicly rather than directly. Our City Operations leadership team always has and continues to meet with employees regularly, and answer their questions and listen to any concerns they may have. We encourage City of Edmonton employees to share their perspectives, insights and observations at work. The facts around snow and ice are clear: For one, anti-icer works in our northern climate and is used in nearby jurisdictions, including by the Province on the Anthony Henday, and by Strathcona County and St. Albert as part of their pilot projects. Second, sand, salt and anti-icer all continue to be used depending on conditions; it’s about using the right tool for the right condition. And finally, for any of the major snowfalls this past winter, we completed our plowing of priority roadways (arterials, collectors and bus routes) within 48 hours. We value transparency and will continue our engagement with employees to ensure their wisdom is part of our winter road maintenance program development. Administration will be providing a comprehensive update on Alternative Practices to Snow and Ice Control in June. We are confident that our updates in both June and August will provide you with the information you need to make an informed assessment of the snow and ice program in the best interest of Edmontonians. Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly. c: Linda Sahli, City Clerk Executive Leadership Team",,"No",,,

Integrated Infrastructure Services (IIS) is responsible for managing all substantial capital infrastructure projects within the 2019-2022 Capital Budget except for those projects related to land, equipment, and information technology. IIS works with business partners across the organization to deliver on capital projects to accomplish the following: Balance Capital Investment - Key work within the Project and Asset Management program balances the infrastructure investment required to maximize the value of City assets while supporting ongoing growth needs. The capital program invests in the renewal of roads, neighbourhoods, parks, and City-owned buildings while planning and delivering new infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of citizens in a growing city. Supporting the City Plan/ Big City Moves and Council’s Goals - The City Plan is an invitation to join in building a version of our city that respects and preserves the things we value today while also creating a city to attract and inspire its next million residents. Big City Moves are an invitation to work together as a community to build our future city. They define bold, transformative priorities to create a different set of opportunities for Edmonton, including Greener as We Grow, A Rebuildable City, A Community of Communities, Inclusive and Compassionate and Catalyze and Converge. Growth and renewal infrastructure projects contribute to and build on City Council's goals, specifically having a Rebuildable City as one of our big moves - respecting our past but planning for the future, continually reimagining our city and how we serve residents. We are delivering on this through our capital program. With every project, we are reimagining our streets, our open spaces and our residential neighbourhoods to accommodate more change, more business and more people, ensuring they can adapt over time. This strategy will be accomplished by balancing short-term economic recovery by creating over 13,000 construction-related jobs and long-term growth to accommodate an additional one million people. The 2021 fiscal year is the third year of the 2019-2022 Capital Budget, balancing the infrastructure investment required to keep existing City assets in good condition while supporting ongoing growth. Approximately 41 percent of the 2019–2022 capital investment is for renewing roads, neighbourhoods, parks, City-owned buildings and transit vehicles, with the remaining 59 percent supporting planning and delivery of new infrastructure such as the LRT expansion and Yellowhead Trail Conversion Program. The 2022 fiscal year is the final year of the 2019-2022 Capital Budget, bringing the start of a new budget cycle with the opportunity to reevaluate the priorities for future investments. Even with the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have been consistent in delivering projects on time, on budget and on purpose. In Q3, IIS actively worked on 275 projects, with 92 percent of projects trending on budget and 79 percent on time. As mentioned during Council orientation, projects following the Project Development and Delivery Model (PDDM) have trended well when measured against on-time and on-budget benchmarks. Of the significant profiles reported in the November 22, 2021 Council Report (FCS00829 - Capital Financial Update - September 30, 2021), 37 are significant infrastructure standalone capital profiles; 27 of these profiles are being delivered from their inception under PDDM. For these 37 significant infrastructure projects, the performance of projects based on project counts is reflected below: Q3 2021 Active Significant Standalone Project Performance Projects not approved under PDDM PDDM Projects Change with PDDM On-Budget 71% 100% 29% On-Time 85% 96% 11% Further information on the Department’s project performance and new projects initiated in Q3 are noted in Attachment 1.

In 2014, Edmonton City Council approved a business case to redevelop the former airport site for up to 30,000 residents. Council saw the Blatchford lands — 536 acres just north of the downtown core — as an opportunity to leverage an existing asset to build a stronger Edmonton. They chose a development approach that prioritized density, design and long-term resilience. In October 2020, the neighbourhood reached a milestone with the first residents moving into the community. Blatchford is designed as an amenity-rich neighbourhood in the heart of Edmonton, a catalyst for transformational land development, and a path towards a more resilient future. It combines the best of mature neighbourhoods ⁠— central living, connected streets, vibrant public spaces ⁠— with sustainable features to strengthen the community for generations, including renewable energy and low-impact design, paths and public transit, high building standards and a diversity of housing. The City of Edmonton’s Blatchford Redevelopment Office (BRO) is the master land developer of the Blatchford site. As the developer, the BRO can implement Council’s guiding vision for the community, while also aligning the community with the City Plan, the Community Energy Transition Strategy and Action Plan and other guiding documents. Community Staging: Planning, Engineering and Construction Blatchford is roughly the size of downtown Edmonton. Depending on market conditions, full development is expected to take roughly 25 years. Working with consultants, the BRO rezones and subdivides land and creates fully serviced lots by installing infrastructure, including storm and sanitary sewers, water, district energy, power, roads, sidewalks and parks. Serviced lots are then sold to private sector builders aligned with the Blatchford vision. As part of their sales contracts, builders are required to comply with architectural, district energy and green building codes. Stage 1: The majority of the parcels in the first stage have been sold or are currently pending, and public infrastructure is largely complete, including Littlewood Park and a stormwater pond. In addition to the initial fee-simple townhouses on the site, builders will soon begin adding other housing products, including multi unit townhouses and apartment style condos, providing more options and a wider range of price points. Stage 2: Construction is well underway on stage 2, including the completion of grading and removals, underground utility installation and surface construction. Power is planned to be completed before the end of 2021 and landscaping in 2022 to align with anticipated home construction. Stage two land is for sale and the vast majority of parcels are sold or pending. Stage 3: The BRO has rezoned the site, received subdivision approval and detailed design is underway. For efficiency, site preparation work (grading and removals) was completed with the stage 2 work. Underground construction is expected to begin in 2022. Stage 4: The zoning and subdivision are approved. Stage 5: Rezoning and subdivision applications have been submitted to Development Services. The rezoning application is scheduled to be at a Public Hearing on November 23. NAIT campus expansion: NAIT has purchased 33 acres of land on the east side of the site to support their campus expansion. As part of the sales agreement, the BRO has rezoned the site, received subdivision approval and is currently completing detailed design. Construction is planned to start in 2022. Hangar 11: In February, City Council directed Administration to investigate the opportunity to sell the historic Hangar 11 to a private developer who has agreed to designate and repurpose the building. The sale agreement has been signed and rezoning and subdivision have been approved. Blatchford Market (Town Centre): There has also been increased interest over the last several months for land in the Blatchford Market commercial area as well as land surrounding the future LRT stations. If market conditions allow, our plan is to have this are","e this area activated with development underway when the LRT is operational. This aligns with the next phase of the District Energy Sharing System, which is planned for the area.","No",,,

Examples include community halls, playgrounds, spray parks, seniors centres, and soccer centres. The park and facility development process supports community groups through all phases of a community project. The process is used for all community-initiated projects and the level of detail for the business case and other key components is scaled to reflect the complexity and cost of the project. Community groups that initiate projects go through either the Neighbourhood Park Development Program (NPDP) or the Community Group Led Construction Process. The project process selected depends on whether the amenity will be developed on open space parkland (NPDP) or in a neighbourhood park on an area of land that is licensed or leased to the group (community-led). The NPDP includes a funding component for groups to apply for $15,000 to $250,000 depending on the size and scope of the project and other criteria. Process Improvement In 2018, the City Auditor conducted a review of the City process for community projects in neighbourhood parks. The audit resulted in three key recommendations: ● Determine the program owner to determine who is accountable for the program ● Develop a performance management framework to measure performance of the program ● Work with community stakeholders to address challenges and make program improvements Administration accepted these recommendations and, at the same time, established a community working group to provide recommendations on process improvements. As a result of both the audit and the feedback from the community working group, Administration made a number of improvements, including: ● a streamlined park and facility development process ● a scalability matrix to help ensure that the level of detail, rigour and oversight of projects is proportional to the complexity and cost ● redefined the steps Administration takes to review and support projects and project proponents ● piloting a small business area to implement these and future improvements ● created a user-friendly Community Group Led Construction Projects Guide and Neighbourhood Park Development Program Guide .../2 - 2 - ● provided training for all staff involved in the process Park and Facility Development Team The Park and Facility Development team is currently in a pilot phase until the end of March 2022. The team is tasked to maintain and enhance processes, procedures and communications with a community development lens. This builds upon the knowledge, skills and talents of citizens. The team is a single point of contact with the City. Staff assess project proposals and readiness, track projects, support issues management, undertake research, develop and improve internal practices, operating policies and procedures, and gather feedback from internal and external stakeholders as part of the evaluation and continuous improvement. Following the completion of the pilot phase, an evaluation and assessment of the team will be undertaken. Next Steps: Over the next six months, Administration will advance a number of initiatives including: ● establishing an external advisory group to provide feedback on the improvements to date and provide recommendations for additional improvements on an ongoing basis, including citizens that were part of the initial community working group as well as other partners that have undertaken projects within the last few years ● developing a training framework and schedule for community partners and City staff to enhance understanding of the process and working relationships ● further developing a tracking system to provide high-level updates so that community groups can see the progress and status of their projects For further information on the park and facility development process, please contact David Jones, Branch Manager, Community Standards and Neighbourhoods, at david.jonescsn@edmonton.ca.

Key Messages ● Generally a RF1 to RF3 entails an increase of 5 to 8 units, that would add three to six trips during the peak hour. This represents a negligible increase to the overall capacity and won't impact current traffic operations on the local road. ● C ommon concerns such as speeding, high demand for on-street parking, and safety in school and playground areas may be valid but not necessarily related to a rezoning application. Administration endeavours to follow up on these concerns and link residents and communities with programs designed to assist them at a neighbourhood level. Examples include: School Zone Safety Reviews, Vision Zero Street Labs, Speed Toolkits, Parking Programs, among others. ● Increase in densification in existing neighborhoods will be essential to meet the goals of the City Plan. Historically low density and primarily residential neighbourhoods will (continue to) slowly transition to more dense, mixed-use neighbourhoods. These changes will ultimately help achieve many of the intersecting targets of City Plan: 50% of new units added through infill, 15-minute districts, reducing household transportation expenditures, reducing and eventually eliminating our per person GHG emissions. Transportation System Analysis Administration uses a number of different tools for assessing the performance of the transportation system and individual development applications. Policy C569 guides this assessment which requires a multi-modal approach for assessing the performance of a transportation infrastructure, including modal priorities and land 1 / 2 use characteristics of the surrounding area. Also, ConnectEdmonton and The City Plan provide a blueprint for a significant portion of Edmonton’s future growth to occur within the Anthony Henday Drive. These include ambitious targets for how we move about the City using a variety of travel modes - walking, cycling, transit and vehicles - and how Edmontonian’s should be able to complete their daily needs locally. The tools Administration uses include the Regional Travel Model and Traffic Impact Assessments where appropriate. ● Regional Travel Model: Cumulative impact of densification at a neighbourhood level is assessed as part of long term planning through many analytical tools, such as, the City of Edmonton’s Regional Travel Model (RTM). These look at how the transportation system functions into the future and is used to evaluate where and when improvements are made. ● Administration reviews the transportation impacts presented by land development applications. ○ For smaller scale development applications, Administration completes an analysis that traditionally includes vehicular capacity of roadways and intersections, and whether improvements are required to provide additional capacity. In addition to reviewing vehicular impacts, Administration conducts a much broader review that includes active transportation and transit connectivity and safety, qualitative and contextual feedback from engagement and site visits, alignment with recent or planned capital improvements, opportunities to shift modes and other policy goals, among other aspects. ○ For larger scale applications (major amendments to the area neighbourhood structure plan or major rezonings) a Transportation Impact Assessment is required. In addition to the considerations mentioned under smaller scale development, the analysis includes a longer term horizon (typically 30 years), infrastructure requirements and may include a staging analysis to determine development thresholds and corresponding required upgrades to adjacent infrastructure.

Administration’s Approach to Automated Enforcement Safety i s our priority. Administration l ooks forward to continuing to work with the Government of Alberta on ensuring openness and accountability i n using automated traffic enforcement as one of our tools for traffic safety. As part of our focus on making our streets safer and more livable, Edmonton was the first city i n Canada to commit to Vision Zero—the goal of zero traffic related fatalities and serious i njuries. Revenue generated through automated enforcement i s reinvested i nto traffic safety i mprovements, and we remain one of the only cities i n Canada with a stand alone policy on the use of automated enforcement reserve funds. These i mprovements have i ncluded the i nstallation of crosswalks and traffic signals, introduction of l eft turn l anes, and re-engineering of i ntersections to make them safer. Administration’s approach to speed management and enforcement i s to be as transparent and accountable as possible. Government of Alberta Announcement Impacts At this time, Administration has made no commitments to purchase new automated enforcement equipment i n 2020 (this i ncludes both mobile devices as well as i ntersection safety devices). We are currently working on development of the Safe Mobility Strategy which, i n concert with direction from the Government of Alberta, will i nform how and what we deploy in relation to traffic safety measures past 2020. We respect the Government of Alberta’s decision to put i n place a moratorium on allowing municipalities to deploy existing automated traffic enforcement equipment to new l ocations and will adhere to this directive while the provincial review takes place. We will work with the Edmonton Police Service (EPS) and communities to consider automated enforcement alternatives and safety improvement options, if and when new safety concerns arise. Speed Enforcement Vehicle Visibility As part of our continued focus on strengthening accountability and transparency i n the speed management and enforcement program, Administration will be making speed enforcement vehicles more visible. All City-owned enforcement vehicles (19) will be wrapped i n vinyl material, and l eased vehicles (9) will have a decal on each side as well as a safety whip (flag). See appendix for illustrations of the wraps and decals. Installation will occur i n December, with full i mplementation expected by January 2020. Furthermore, enforcement vehicle parking l ocations have been adjusted so drivers can see the vehicles more easily. Safety whips (flags) will enable vehicles to be more easily spotted when their position may be less visible from certain directions. A public awareness and education campaign has been developed, i ncluding outreach through news media (a formal media announcement i s planned for December), social media, and the brochure included in speeding tickets mail outs from the City of Edmonton.

At this meeting, a group of residents expressed concerns around the construction/permitting process and builder/developer standards, and further requested that UPC consider 13 suggestions (Attachment 1) for improvements. Councillor M. Nickel moved the following motion: (excerpt) Moved by Councillor M. Nickel: 2. That for the 2020 Infill Compliance Team Annual Report to Urban Planning Committee, Administration: ● Consult with stakeholders for input on infill construction practices. ● Work with stakeholders to explore their suggestions in response to the April 23, 2019, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development report CR_6140, and provide a memo to Council in November 2019 with a progress update. ● Explore options to introduce an excavation inspection and approval progress on infill projects. This memo fulfils Bullet 2 within the above motion — providing an overview of the steps undertaken to date to explore the suggestions raised. In the spring of 2020, Administration will incorporate recommendations that emerge from ongoing discussions with stakeholders as part of the Infill Compliance Team Report to Urban Planning Committee. Engagement with Stakeholders City of Edmonton Administration has met with the four community members who brought forward the aforementioned suggestions, collectively known as the ""'Residential Infill Working Group."" This group is not an endorsed committee of the Edmonton Federation of Community of Leagues but consists of volunteers who have expressed concerns about construction practices. Administration has also convened meetings with internal City of Edmonton stakeholders, and external groups such as the Canadian Home Builders' Association (CHBA) and Infill Development in Edmonton Association (IDEA). Administration has also worked with Occupational Health and Safety on areas that involve their jurisdiction. Conversations with these stakeholders has resulted in a review of the suggestions raised, and exploration of approaches and strategies. Suggestions were organized under the following categories: Construction Practices; Referrals and Inspections; Data Collection; Notification and Signage; Community Outreach and Capacity Building; and Infill Compliance Team Report. Administration is actively reviewing the 13 suggestions with support from stakeholders. Ongoing engagement with all stakeholders will continue into 2020 to help inform recommendations which will be housed in the annual Infill Compliance Team Report. Some suggestions, such as amending education material (per Suggestion 12) are actively being reviewed for 2020 implementation, but are dependent on budget considerations. Administration's Infill Liaison Team remains dedicated to working with all members of civil society, public institutions, businesses/industry, and residents, to provide clarity on the City's infill goals, actions, and initiatives.

The topics of these discussion papers are: ● Climate Resilience and Energy Transition ● Nodes and Corridors ● Special Area Zones ● Economy: Supporting Small Businesses Stakeholders, industry, special interest groups and the general public have until September 18 to review the papers on Engaged Edmonton . Participants can provide feedback on the proposed regulatory approach and the associated tradeoffs through a survey and share ideas on a forum. About the Discussion Papers The discussion papers’ proposed actions are informed by the intentions and directions articulated in The Draft City Plan to achieve ConnectEdmonton’s strategic goals. The papers were developed in collaboration with specific City departments and were peer reviewed by a variety of staff from across the corporation. It is anticipated that the Nodes and Corridors and Climate Resilience and Energy Transition papers will garner the most attention and feedback with the second round of discussion papers. It is important to remember that the discussion papers themselves are preliminary thinking intended to generate discussion on the possible approaches and tradeoffs and direction for the new Zoning Bylaw’s regulatory framework. The draft Zoning Bylaw that Administration presents to Council will reflect these conversations and, ultimately, Council will determine if the proposed direction strikes the right balance between reducing regulatory burden and ensuring we are taking action to achieve the Draft City Plan’s vision. 1 Prior to engaging with the discussion paper topics of their choosing, participants are encouraged to read the Philosophy of the New Zoning Bylaw and Overview of the Discussion Papers documents. These papers were posted on July 13 with the first batch of discussion papers and help participants better understand how to engage with the papers, why the new Zoning Bylaw is needed and what outcomes the new Zoning Bylaw will support. The Nodes and Corridors Discussion Paper The Nodes and Corridors paper outlines how the Draft City Plan’s concept of nodes and corridors will translate into development regulations in the new Zoning Bylaw. Nodes are centres of activity that feature a variety of land uses including housing types, recreational opportunities and employment. They are places to gather that serve a broad catchment area where mobility networks converge. Corridors are places for movement, living and commerce that are anchored by the mobility systems that connect most nodes. The Draft City Plan's approach to nodes and corridors is intended to direct investment, infrastructure enhancements and services to support greater density of people and jobs in a more sustainable way. Implementing this concept requires creating new mixed use zones to encourage walkable, transit oriented development, with specific density and builtform requirements. Through the paper, Administration proposes using context modifiers to create levers that will increase land use intensity based on a site's location within the network. These include height, active frontage requirements, urban design and transitions between sites. Bonus provisions are being considered under certain conditions, where additional public amenity contributions are provided as a trade off for additional height, floor area ratio, and/or dwelling units. The Climate Resilience and Energy Transition Discussion Paper Climate Resilience and Energy Transition paper proposes adding various measures in the new Zoning Bylaw to reduce carbon emissions and prepare the city to adapt to different climate impacts, such as flooding and wildfire. It recommends creating a development point system to provide applicants with options on measures to implement, and to gradually implement zoning regulations (after the development of the new Zoning Bylaw) to align with other projects such as wildfire risk modelling and Energy Neutral Buildings research. This staggered approach would allow Administration and industry time to create the necessary processes and build capacity. The Next Round of Discussion Papers The final discussion papers will be released in October. Their topics are: ● Parks and Civic Service Zones ● Residential Zones ● Notification and Variances ● Signs 2 If you have questions on the Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative, please reach out to Livia Balone, Director",", Director of the initiative, by email at livia.balone@edmonton.ca, or by telephone at (780) 686-0212.

There have been some inquiries about the work of the committee from the community and we wanted to ensure that you were aware of the underlying philosophy and direction of how this work is being completed and who is contributing to this historic effort. Through the excellent facilitative leadership of the Circle Keepers, Terri Suntjens and Rob Houle, the pathway for establishing the committee began with a pipe ceremony. From this ceremony came two important guidances: 1. Confirmation of the name of the committee - iyiniw iskwewak wihtwawin (ee-new-skwew wee-ta-win) translates to Indigenous women’s involvement/movement/action. iyiniw encompasses all those who come from the land, representing the first peoples. Iskwewak is “women”, and the word wihtwawin implies our being and the way we do things and our involvement in that process. 2. Direction from co-chairs and Elders that we should honour traditionally matriarchal Indigenous cultures and actively uplift Indigenous women's voices by creating a committee made up solely of Indigenous women. The committee consists of 17 women representing the variety of Indigenous peoples who gathered on and cared for the land where the city of Edmonton is now located. These women represent First Nations from Treaty 6, 7, and 8 territories, as well as the Métis and Inuit. Edmonton, traditionally a gathering place, is reflected in this diverse membership. Each of these women has had the opportunity to access and invite other Knowledge Keepers as guest speakers to share information as well. Within this group of distinguished women, multiple generations and languages are represented, and all have connections to their broader community in order to consult along the way. Given the challenge of a very short timeline to do this work, the group has been a model of openness, cooperation, good relations and consensus. .../2 - 2 - Aside from the six regular Thursday evening meetings this group has participated in, they also took part in a full weekend gathering, including a Nightlodge ceremony to determine an honourable pathway to arrive at the 12 Indigenous ward names. Additionally, the group is working on creating educational information on the significance of each name and pronunciation guidance.

According to CBC News , the camp's media liaison, Shima Robinson, said that ""The new demands are more narrow scoped, are about more immediate responses that our municipality can act on, as well as being in general actionable in the ten weeks we have or so until deep winter hits."" On Wednesday (September 2) City Administration met with the camp organizers to clarify and ask questions about their demands. Also on Wednesday, Park Rangers and City Operations proceeded with the cleanup of a new encampment in the greenspace to the west of Camp Pekiwewin. Collaboration between Park Rangers, organizers and campers was very good with one of Camp Pekiwewin's organizers assisting in communicating with the additional campers to help the cleanup go smoothly and without incident. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION NEIGHBOURHOOD SERVICES Following the Provincial Stage 2 relaunch, activities, events and citizen-led parkland projects have resumed and the demand for small neighbourhood-level events has increased as more people are at home and spending greater time in their community. Requests for staff to assist with establishing informal networks of care and assistance so that neighbours can support one another in remaining safe, returning to work, and caring for isolated seniors/vulnerable people have also increased. To assist with requests for service, Neighbourhood Services staff that were temporarily laid off in May have been approved for return to work in September.

Cllr. Stevenson - Why does Waste Services provide only residential collection? The decision to cease commercial collections was part of the 25-year Waste Strategy ( City Operation report CR_5829 ). Administration recommended the following: That Utility Committee recommend to City Council: 1. That the 25-year Comprehensive Waste Management Strategy, as set out in Attachment 2, of the August 29, 2019, City Operations report CR_5829, be approved. 2. That the cessation of new Commercial Waste Collection services be effective October 1, 2019, including commencement of the wind-down and transition of existing commercial collection accounts, and that wind-down exceptions be made for those commercial organizations that are willing to move to three-stream source separation (organics, recyclables and residual garbage) as part of an Early Adopters Program. The rationale for the recommendation is noted below and summarized from the August 29, 2019 City Operations report CR_5829, Attachment 4, page 10. The City’s involvement in direct collection of waste from the ICI sector was inadequate in its efforts to impact waste diversion in the non-regulated sectors. While the business line had successfully grown a modest client base, its impacts were only felt on approximately four percent of the industry. In addition, the City’s direct participation in the marketplace was seen as a barrier to cooperation with the waste industry, which perceived conflict with the City’s dual roles as regulator and market participant. It was clear that the City could have a role to play in ensuring the success of a mandatory Source Separated Organics Program. …/2 -2- However, operational constraints, industry resistance and limited market success all underlined the recommendation that the City move away from direct market participation. Instead, the City could play a larger role as a regulator, providing rules, facilitating market development and providing resources and educational support. Committee amended the recommendation (see below) and it was approved by Council. The committee removed the Early Adopters Program from the recommendation as it was determined that the City should be out of the Commercial Collection space entirely. That Utility Committee recommend to City Council: 1. That the 25-year Comprehensive Waste Management Strategy, as set out in Attachment 2, of the August 29, 2019, City Operations report CR_5829, be approved. 2. That the cessation of new Commercial Waste Collection services be effective October 1, 2019, including commencement of the wind-down and transition of existing commercial collection accounts. Cllr. Salvador - Potential opportunities for revenue generation. Waste Services maintains stable and consistent utility rates as per the Waste Services Utility Fiscal Policy C558B . This is through service delivery transformation and by pursuing opportunities to generate additional revenue through the sale of waste byproducts. New revenue opportunities that Waste Services is pursuing include the following: ● Landfill Gas to Renewable Natural Gas - Waste Services has secured a $10 million grant from Emissions Reductions Alberta to develop the Landfill Gas to Renewable Natural Gas project for landfill gas generated at the Clover Bar Landfill. The scope of the project includes upgrading the collection system, and construction of a new flare and a landfill gas to renewable natural gas conversion plant. The project is expected to be operational in 2023, and to produce approximately 325,000 GJ of marketable renewable natural gas annually, with associated total emissions reductions averaging 149,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. ● Advanced Energy Research Facility (AERF) - Waste Services has arranged a license and partnership agreement with a major industrial partner. Over the next five years, the AERF will continue to drive innovation in bioenergy and renewable resource areas with the objective of fully recovering costs and generating additional revenue for the City. The industrial partner intends to invest $6 million in 2021 to upgrade the facility and about $50 million over the next five years to operate the facility. …/3 -3- ● Sales and Marketing Plan for Aggregate and Compost Products - To aid diversion efforts, compost products and recycled aggregate products will be marketed with a focused intent of inventory turnover, cost recove","er, cost recovery and profitability. The continuous marketing efforts will secure beneficial reuse of the products created from waste materials. ● Alberta Clean Energy Technology Accelerator (ACETA) - ACETA is a leading renewable fuels technology accelerator that offers technology developers turnkey access to infrastructure, waste gases, fuels (liquid and solid) and residual materials through a unique R&D partnership. It is funded through a partnership between the University of Alberta, InnoTech Alberta, CanmetENERGY-Devon and the City of Edmonton, with partial funding from Alberta Innovates. The virtual hub will help innovators, from academia to entrepreneurs in the private sector, to accelerate technology development through scale-up, and position Alberta for success in clean energy technology and renewable fuels innovation. ● Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) - The MRF processes residential blue bag and blue bin material by sorting the materials into separate streams. The separated streams are then sold on the open market to recycling organizations, generating a small revenue that helps offset the costs to sort the materials. Cllr. Rutherford - Data on how many calls were received for missed pickups. During the weeks of June 29 and July 6, of the 250,000 city-wide homes serviced, approximately 13,000 homes in southwest Edmonton participating in the cart program had their waste pick up delayed by a couple days. This was due to the contractor facing fleet and staffing challenges during the introduction of automated waste collection. Waste Services took a collaborative approach to resolve these missed collection issues and ensured waste collection services were delivered to all Edmontonians. Collection vehicles from the waste fleet and waste collections staff assisted in providing collection services to the affected communities. The Waste Services Customer Support Team provided exceptional service during trying times of high call volumes (approximately 1,000 calls) by concerned and upset residential customers due to missed collections. Waste Services also effectively maintained a positive relationship with the contractor by providing additional training and support. Waste Services has mechanisms within the waste collection contracts to penalize for delayed or missed collections and to recover full cost if the City steps in to provide the service. Waste Services continues to penalize for any missed or delayed collections and the costs for collection provided by City staff. …/4 -4- Cllr. Cartmell - Process diagram of where things go. The process flow diagram below shows the various waste streams, the facilities where they are dropped off or processed at and where the waste materials ultimately end up. Process Flow Diagram Cllr. Paquette - What is the cost of additional yard waste pickups? The single unit business case from August 2019 ( City Operations report CR_7173 ) outlines a series of yard waste options and the projected costs to implement them over a 30 year timeframe. The approved option of two yard waste collections in the spring and two in the fall was projected to cost $8 million in capital and $86 million in operating over the 30 years. Actual costs following implementation through the Edmonton Cart Rollout in 2021 are aligned with what was presented in the business case. An alternate option of 15 bi-weekly collections in the spring and fall was also presented in the business case (schedules with six and eight collections per year were eliminated from analysis because they have the same resource and fleet requirements as 15 collections per year). The projected cost of 15 collections was $49 million in capital and $245 million in operating, representing an additional $79 million in net present value costs over the approved option over the 30 year timeframe. …/5 Set out for collection Drop off at the Eco Station / / ' 0 t} Il:J 0 (!)

Changes to the yard waste collection dates, and adjustments to the marketing and communications materials for the program, are intended to make the program more accessible to Edmontonians and help ensure that the approved collection frequency is meeting the needs of residents. Administration will present a report on the Edmonton Cart Rollout, including separate yard waste collection, to the Utility Committee in the first quarter of 2022. Although additional program adjustments can be considered at this time, the performance of the program will be difficult to evaluate before it is fully rolled out (major service changes require an adjustment period, and most homes have not yet had access to spring yard waste collection). Mid-year changes to the program may also be more costly than forecast and are likely to exacerbate the challenges that residents had keeping track of their yard waste collection dates in 2021.

CURRENT ACTIONS (Immediate) 1. That a Notice of Intention to Designate a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1, be served on the owners of the property located at 10126 - 100 Street NW in accordance with Section 26 of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9. 1 2. That the City Manager be appointed to implement matters arising from the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Designate the Canada Permanent Building as a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1. FUTURE ACTIONS (At least 60 days after the Notice of Intention to Designate is served) 1. Pursuant to the provisions of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9, a Bylaw to Designate the Canada Permanent Building as a Municipal Historic Resource (the “Bylaw”) will be brought to City Council for consideration. 1 On November 26, 2019, City Council passed amendments to the City Administration Bylaw, delegating approval of Notices of Intention to Designate (NOI) under the Historical Resources Act (HRA) to the City Manager, where the owner consents to the designation of their property. The NOI initiates the designation process under the Historical Resources Act ; the final decision on designation remains with City Council by way of approval of a designation bylaw. 1 2. If approved, the Bylaw and corresponding Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will contemplate funding of up to $112,620 to be provided from the Heritage Resources Reserve to fund City-funded work on the Canada Permanent Building, as described in Attachment 5. BACKGROUND The Canada Permanent Building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton and merits designation under City Policy C450B - Policy to Encourage the Designation and Rehabilitation of Municipal Historic Resources in Edmonton. The building was constructed in 1910 and features an Edwardian Baroque Style of design. On November 18, 2021, the owners completed the application requirements to have the Canada Permanent Building, located at 10126 - 100 Street NW, designated as a Municipal Historic Resource under the provisions of City Policy C450B. The Canada Permanent Building was designated as a Provincial Historic Resource on January 3, 1995. If designated municipally, it will benefit from dual historic designation. Rehabilitation work on the Canada Permanent Building has already been initiated. The property owners have worked closely with Provincial and Municipal Heritage Planners to ensure that the work complies with the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . If designated municipally, a rehabilitation grant as described in Attachment 5 will be provided to the property owner for work completed in advance of the designation. The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the owner will be provided up to $112,620 for rehabilitation from the Heritage Resources Reserve. The current Reserve balance is sufficient to cover the committed funding, including funding for the Canada Permanent Building. The total estimated cost of the restoration work for the project is $225,240. Beyond the $112,620 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, the owner is responsible for all costs of the restoration work for the project. The projections for the Reserve (using current commitments) anticipate a Reserve balance of $4.2 million at the end of 2021. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. Based on the current commitments, the Reserve balance is anticipated to decline to a balance of $2 million at the end of 2022. The Reserve is funded by the tax levy on an annual basis ($2.3 million in 2021, including $418,000 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd.). 2 PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT Public engagement was not undertaken as part of this process, as it is not required under the Historical Resources Act .

On January 25, 2021, City Council approved Policy C625: 2021 Edmonton Economic Recovery Construction Grant Incentive Policy with funding of up to $22.9 million. The Policy was amended at the November 30, 2021 City Council meeting to extend the construction start date to March 31, 2022. The intent of the grant program for qualifying Centre City projects is to support short-term job creation in the current economic conditions and longer-term City Plan goals. The program is on a first-come, first-served basis for qualifying projects that will provide at least 50 new residential units, have a construction value over $10 million and have an approved development permit. The successful Applicants will receive a grant payment each year for a period of five years (2022-2026) that is equivalent to the increase in municipal taxes over the 2021 ‘baseline’ taxes paid. This program is now closed for new submissions. The 2021 Edmonton Economic Incentive Construction Grant Program began accepting applications in March of 2021. To date, there are nine projects with signed Grant Funding Agreements that have met the eligibility criteria (and one additional application currently under review) for an estimated total amount of $19.3 million. The estimated grant amount assumes 2021 tax rates and assessment increases based on construction timelines provided by the applicants, which could change if construction is slower than expected. An allowance of $3.6 million has been made to cover potential increases that may arise from increases in tax rates and market values. Collectively the nine approved projects represent $535,970,023 million in private investment, the addition of 2,079 new residential units and 62,336 square feet of commercial space to the Centre City. This construction activity supports an estimated 4,042 jobs. This level of residential construction is higher than typically observed in the Centre City area. Based on building permit data, the core neighbourhoods of Downtown, Oliver, Westmount, Queen Mary Park, Central McDougall, McCauley, and Boyle Street had an average of 765 new residential units per year from 2010-2020. Further details are provided in Attachment 1 , which is to remain private until the contracts are signed, and then become public information, pursuant to Section 16(a)(ii) of the Freedom of Information and Protection and Privacy Act.

Eng. Deputy City Manager Subject: Edmonton Transit Service Medical Response Protocol Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) has protocols in place to respond safely if a medical emergency takes place on a bus or LRT. All Transit Operators are trained in how to follow these protocols and related escalation procedures. These processes are similar across transit services in Canada and regularly reviewed. In addition, over the last three years, Operators received continuous training in how to manage difficult and dangerous situations, using training materials from the Canadian Urban Transit Association. Once an Operator is alerted of a medical emergency, they are instructed to safely pull their bus over until instructed to depart post-incident, and contact the ETS Control Centre (Control) via the on-board technology to notify them of the emergency. Control then connects with 911 to have the appropriate response coordinated. The trained staff in the Control Centre are able to provide critical information such as location and severity quickly; while on calls, they can activate a live look-in using cameras on board the bus or LRT to give real-time information to 911. ETS Control is in regular contact with 911 and as a result these calls are responded to very quickly. The 24/7 Control Centre manages service on the road, the movement of buses and LRVs, support for Operators and riders, and they help to keep Operators safe. In addition to emergency response resources, the Control Centre may also dispatch service supports such as a Transit Inspector to assist with the service disruption. In the case of reported overdoses, Transit Peace Officers are trained and supplied with naloxone to assist. Administration is in the process of getting Transit Inspectors as well as contracted Security Guards trained and supplied with naloxone, to enhance the response to reported overdoses on transit property. …/2 -2- They carry the appropriate personal protective equipment, are throughout the City, and can respond quickly to assist. If a person is revived and is agitated and/or upset that naloxone was deployed, these resources are in a position to respond. By going through Control for all emergency situations: ● Control Centre staff can get resources dispatched quickly; cell phones are not permitted to be used in the Operator compartment and are not as accessible as the on board technology ● Control knows the exact location of the bus and can quickly get mobile and emergency resources to the location to respond to the situation ● Control is able to dispatch multiple resources through the single call from Operators (Emergency Responders, TPOs, Inspectors, Peer Support) ● Control is able to relay information internally to inform escalation protocols Lastly, the Employer’s responsibilities related to occupational health and safety include hazard recognition and assessment, as well as implementing related control measures. To reduce safety risks for Transit Operators, they are instructed to stay in their seat and communicate through the on board technology with the Control Centre for any activity on board that is problematic or disruptive. A recent incident was shared with ETS about how a Transit Operator responded to a reported overdose on board a bus. The investigation is complete and in this instance, protocols were not followed correctly. ETS works closely with Employee Services and ATU Local 569 when instances like this occur, and will be following up with the Operator.

The State of Local Emergency will terminate by lapse of time at midnight unless further action is taken. The notice was posted online at edmonton.ca . Following the EAC meeting, Mayor Don Iveson and Interim City Manager Adam Laughlin held a media availability to answer questions from journalists. A news release was issued with additional details. The news release also highlighted new relaunch activities such as new Shared Streets openings and 500,000 non-medical masks to be distributed through ETS. ● Daily Update Format: This Council Daily Update will undergo a transformation starting Monday, June 8. We will be reducing the Update from five days a week to three days a week. As we are transitioning to the relaunch/recover phase from the rapidly-changing response phase, reducing the frequency will help ensure the updates remain meaningful to Council and will reduce the resources required to maintain these updates. There will also be a new look and feel to the updates. ● Provincial Guidelines: Today Alberta Health released new guidelines for outdoor events , outdoor fitness classes and gondolas, trams and chairlifts and updated guidance for restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars and golf courses and driving ranges . We will evaluate these new/updated guidelines for any impacts to our operations. ● Domestic Violence Data: The Edmonton Police Service Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. The number of reported Domestic Violence cases has now been below the three-year average for the past three weeks. The number dropped off sharply between Week 18 (ending May 3) and Week 19 (ending May 10). ● Animal Care & Control Centre (ACCC): The number of visitors to the ACCC has increased to an average of 31 in-person visits per day primarily related to pet licensing inquiries. As of June 1, 2020, the Centre is at 30% capacity for dogs.

While national figures show some recovery, Edmonton is showing continued job losses, with the number of unemployed residents now topping 100,000. Media may contact Councillors for comment on the current economic situation. City of Edmonton Position: The City is concerned about unemployment, because of both its social impact on people and families, and its economic impact on the community and City programs. Key Messages: ● We recognize that high unemployment rates are difficult for people and the economy. ○ More than 106,000 of our neighbours want to work but don’t have a job. Others have had their hours reduced, been temporarily laid off, or have seen their incomes decline. ● There are indications that these numbers will improve, because these statistics reflect the early weeks of the province’s first phase in their relaunch strategy. ○ Information was gathered in mid-May, and relates to the previous week’s work. ○ Alberta began phase 1 of relaunch on May 14. With many businesses beginning to reopen, we expect next month’s numbers to show increased economic activity. ○ Employment had declined in restaurants and retail, and these sectors are beginning to return. ○ Other data sources, like employment levels in other provinces, are also pointing towards recovery. ● Edmontonians can play a part in turning these numbers around. ○ More than 675,000 Edmontonians do have jobs, and we are relying on them. ○ By shopping locally, and safely participating in public life, residents can help sustain jobs and businesses. ○ By being innovative and entrepreneurial, Edmontonians can create opportunities in difficult circumstances. Many have already been ingenious in finding ways to support their customers, and that ingenuity will be needed as circumstances change again. ○ As a community, we are connected, educated, determined and innovative. We have talents the world will need as we move past this crisis. ● The City is taking action to support people and jobs. ○ A five-part effort to help businesses is working to improve the local economy. Measures include business licence fee reduction, grants for companies and associations, business advice, government process improvements, and specific measures like patio expansions. ○ A new energy rebate program is supporting energy-efficient building upgrades and purchases of electric chargers and bikes. ○ Important decisions about City programs lie ahead as we deal with the ongoing economic challenges that COVID brings. Approach : While the City will not actively seek media attention on this issue, a statement will be provided to those reporters seeking the City’s perspective. Background: Edmonton’s unemployment rate was 7.9 per cent in March, 10.0 per cent in April, and 13.6 per cent in May. Compared to last month’s statistics for Edmonton, there were fewer people with jobs, more unemployed people, and fewer people who are hopeful enough to be looking for a job. Employment fell by nearly 50,000 in May (from 723,600 to 675,400) — the largest single month decline since local data became available in 2001. The number of unemployed residents increased by 20,000 (from 80,000 to 106,100). The increase in the unemployment rate was mitigated by the fact there were 20,000 fewer people in the labour force, meaning they were not actively looking for work (from 803,600 to 781,500). More than a third (34.8 per cent) of the national labour force remained underutilized, meaning a significant percentage of people were unemployed and looking for work, wanting to work but not looking for a job right now, or working less than half of their usual hours. Though the underutilization rate in May came down from the previous month, the estimate remains considerably higher than the 11.9 per cent observed in February. The national underutilization rate for youth (aged 15-24) was 51.8 per cent. Though comparable data on youth underutilization are not available at the local level, the Edmonton youth unemployment rate is 30.9 per cent. This will have an impact on the City’s ability to retain young people. The COVID-19 pandemic has played out differently for employment of females and males. In Edmonton, the year-over-year decline in employment was greater for females with a loss of 75,900 in May, compared to a decline of 47,500 for males.

Concerns have been expressed that the City will be more permissive about cycling in this area through projects like the Ribbon of Green renewal. This information is not correct. The Whitemud Nature Reserve is a highly valued natural asset within the North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine System. Through both the 2004 South Whitemud Planning Study and 2018 draft Ribbon of Green SW+NE, the Whitemud Nature Reserve has been classified as “Preservation,” the highest level of ecological protection. This Classification limits access to foot-based travel and prohibits cycling in ecologically sensitive areas. Administration has no predetermined intentions of reversing that strategic direction. To further illustrate, the South Whitemud Planning Study addresses the portions of the Whitemud and Blackmud Ravines extending from Fox Drive to 41 Avenue SW (Attachment 1). The draft Ribbon of Green SW+NE modernizes the portions of the Whitemud Nature Reserve south of the Ogilvie Ridge/Westbrook Estates (Attachment 2) and further expands the preservation classification and limited access. As Administration initiates a full renewal of the 1992 Ribbon of Green, the project objectives are to produce one modernized, comprehensive strategic plan for the river valley and ravine system. The Ribbon of Green renewal is underway in preliminary stages, and will build on the assessment methodologies and strategic oversight of the draft Ribbon of Green SW+NE. The Ribbon of Green renewal will address the areas of the river valley and ravine system not 1 examined in the draft Ribbon of Green SW+NE, including the northern portions of the Whitemud Nature Reserve (Ogilvie Ridge / Westbrook Estates to Fox Drive). Public and stakeholder engagement will be a critical component of the project. Final recommendations will be a product of informed decision making through environmental and cultural assessments, recreational and celebration assessments, and extensive Indigenous, public and stakeholder engagement. The public and interested stakeholders can sign up to receive project updates at edmonton.ca/ribbonofgreen. Administration is aware of existing challenges with cyclists continuing to access Whitemud Nature Reserve, and recent years have seen an increase in unapproved trail development throughout the River Valley. Work continues, as resources permit, to further partnership engagement, education, and enforcement to address these issues.

Please bear with us as we will continue to make updates to the layout, format and content in the coming days. Provincial Update: The Province currently remains in Stage One of its relaunch strategy. Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health, and Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, did not make any public updates at today's media availability regarding timing for Stage Two of the province's strategy. Details of relaunch stage updates are expected later this week. Dr. Hinshaw did highlight that they are following a number of COVID-19 cases linked to the Sofina food processing facility in Edmonton with 6 confirmed cases now in self-isolation and site-wide employee testing being arranged. She also encouraged anyone who attended recent protests to go for COVID-19 testing even if they do not have symptoms. Dr. Hinshaw has also allowed the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers to resume practices in their home arenas. Public Service Announcement: As the City relaunches we are inviting community input on mobility, washrooms, and developments in Garneau, Oliver and Downtown.

The recruitment, screening, and training process for a DATS operator take approximately three months. The training of a DATS operator from classroom work, driving training, and training with an auxiliary instructor takes approximately 5 weeks. Because of this, DATS hires in advance for projected retirements, so there are never vacancies greater than three months. In the past six months, DATS saw excessive retirements and responded by expediting its normal spring recruitment to January, with Operators scheduled to be in service in April.

The approved 2016–2018 Operating Budget does not include funding for additional transit service hours. Therefore, ETS will provide service improvements in 2017 by reallocating two per cent of service hours (about 1,000 hours per week) from underutilized routes that do not meet the performance standards set by City Policy C539. This plan was previously outlined in a report to Council: CR_3449 2016 Transit Service Reallocation Plan . Last year ’s reallocated hours have effectively improved on-time bus performance , addressing many of the observations released in the 2015 City Auditor’s Annual Report . On-time weekday arrivals at transit centres have increased from 57.9 per cent in December 2014 to 65.4 per cent in December 2016. On-time weekday departures also increased from 77.5 per cent in December 2014 to 81.4 per cent in December 2016. Our target is to achieve a performance standard of 90% of trips arriving and departing on time and we are committed to continual improvement to close this gap. The trips that were added in 2016 to address overcrowding have better ridership than the previous trips that were cancelled. Cancelled trips had an average of 9 passenger boardings per hour while the trips that were added have an average of 42 passenger boardings per hour. Frequency improvements on Route 3, 33, 133 and 322 resulted in increased ridership of 27, 9, 136 and 34 per cent respectively in the affected time periods. In the 2017 Reallocation Plan, service reductions will be implemented on 70 routes on July 2, 2017, while service additions and schedule improvements will begin in September 2017. Some underused routes will be cancelled entirely, while other routes will only see cancellations in specific time periods or of particular trips. The transit services that were selected for reallocation in 2017 have an average of 12 passenger boardings per hour. A list of the affected services is attached for your reference. Extensive, proactive communication to transit riders will begin in mid-May with passenger notices on affected trips and details on takeETS.com/news. The second phase of communications, through a variety of channels, will occur in mid-June for the service reallocations and mid-August for the service additions. Bill Sabey, Director of Planning and Scheduling for ETS, will be sending out meeting invites to each of you in order to discuss the overall changes, as well as those specific to your ward. He will also provide you with supporting documentation that can be shared with your staff who may be fielding inquiries from the public.

City of Edmonton Position: At this time, the City has not received a formal proposal from any proponents regarding the Henderson Estates surplus school site at 3408 Riverbend Road . Key Messages: ● The City of Edmonton continually manages and leverages its resources and investments in land and infrastructure to achieve its city-building goals. ● The City routinely receives proposals from organizations to purchase City-owned land, including surplus school sites, which are all evaluated on a case-by-case basis for technical and alignment with city building objectives. ● In the event Administration determines a proposal has merit, it is then brought to City Council for their consideration. ● Currently, the Henderson Estates site is designated for a mix of market and aôﾀﾃﾗordable medium density housing under the Building Housing Choices initiative (Policy C583). The consideration for use of this site for any other purpose will require City Council direction. Approach : The City responded to Elise Stolte via email statement advising that the City has not received any formal proposals regarding the Henderson Estates surplus school site at 3408 Riverbend Road , and outlining the City’s standard process for evaluating proposals to purchase city-owned land. A copy of that response is included in this brieôﾀﾃﾒng. Background: The City has collaborated with school boards on the planning and decision making for these school park sites since 1959. This relationship is governed by a Joint Use Agreement (JUA): Land . The agreement contains a well-deôﾀﾃﾒned process that the joint use partners must follow when school sites are declared surplus by local school boards. Declaration of surplus school sites is at the discretion of the school boards (Catholic, Francophone and EPSB) - not the City. School building sites are only acquired by the City and considered for other uses, such as housing, after they have been declared surplus to school needs by the school boards. The current J oint Use Agreement (JUA): Land , which came into eôﾀﾃﾗect in 2009, requires the local school boards to review vacant school building sites every three years to conôﾀﾃﾒrm if the sites are still needed for school purposes. This agreement will be renewed again in 2019. Once a site has been declared surplus by one school board, the two other local school boards are notiôﾀﾃﾒed and given an opportunity to acquire the land. If the other local school boards decline the oôﾀﾃﾗer, the JUA: Land states that the school boards must then oôﾀﾃﾗer the City ôﾀﾃﾒrst right of purchase on surplus school sites . Once the school site been declared surplus and acquired by the City’s as part of its land inventory, the City then conducts a corporate-wide review to determine if the site is needed for civic purposes, such as ôﾀﾃﾓood mitigation, transportation rights of way, or open space. If no civic need is identiôﾀﾃﾒed, the City will then look at other possible uses that align with Council direction and leverage existing infrastructure investments. Since 2006, City Council has directed Administration to use sites not required for civic purposes to create new housing choices to meet current and future housing needs in Edmonton. Of the 46 vacant school building sites the City has acquired from the school boards since 2006: ● 20 have been approved for townhomes under the First Place program ● 8 have been approved for a mix of market and non-market medium density housing, ranging from townhouses to low-rise apartment buildings, as part of the Building Housing Choices program . ● 8 have been approved for seniors sites ● 3 have been retained for civic purposes ● 2 are being considered for sale to an independent private school (Evansdale & Kiniski Gardens South) ● 3 sites are in the City’s inventory and are awaiting new use decisions ( Oleskiew, Ozerna, and Klaravatten) and ● 2 sites have been claimed by the Francophone school board Statement Provide to Edmonton Journal - as per reporter request (Monday, July 17 at 4:15 pm) At this time, the City has not received a formal proposal from any proponents regarding the Henderson Estates surplus school site at","verbend Road . The City routinely receives proposals from organizations to purchase City-owned land, including surplus school sites, which are all evaluated on a case-by-case basis for technical feasibility and alignment with city building objectives. In the event Administration determines a proposal has merit, it is then brought to City Council for their consideration. Ultimately, Council provides direction to Administration on the use of surplus school land that is not needed for civic purposes, such as ôﾀﾃﾓood mitigation, open space or transportation right of way. Since 2006, the direction from Council has been to use sites not required for civic purposes to create new housing choices to meet current and future housing needs in Edmonton . Currently, the Henderson Estates site is designated for a mix of market and aôﾀﾃﾗordable medium density housing under the Building Housing Choices initiative (Policy C583). The consideration for use of this site for any other purpose will require City Council direction.

As described in the report, the intent of the Evolving Infill project is to build on the momentum and conversations sparked by Edmonton’s Infill Roadmap in an effort to welcome more people and new homes into Edmonton’s older neighbourhoods. The Evolving Infill project can be broken down into five stages: Stage 1 – Startup Stage 2 – Listening and Learning Stage 3 – Putting the Draft Together Stage 4 – Public Review and Discussion Stage 5 – Implementation The Evolving Infill project is currently in the “Listening and Learning” stage. During this stage, there will be opportunity to discuss this exciting project with the public, which will include five open workshops located in each quadrant of the city and in downtown. These engagement opportunities are open to Edmontonians of all ages and cultural backgrounds to attend. In addition, there will be opportunities for smaller, more focused workshop sessions with various stakeholder groups that will provide an opportunity to have deep conversations about residential infill in Edmonton, especially in the context of medium and high density developments.

The bike facility construction began on April 5, 2017. The following provides key points on the progress of the project: 1. The preliminary design of the bike facility has been completed and under review by an independent Road Safety Auditor, with a report due back to Administration by April 15. 2. Construction activities commenced on April 5, 2017, on segments of the bike facility where Administration is satisfied the Road Safety Audit will not identify changes. 3. Two specific locations along the recommended bike grid have construction/operational conflicts with other planned 2017 capital projects. As a result these locations will be re-examined and integrated at a later date: a. 99 Street between Jasper Avenue and 102A Avenue as a result of: ● Valley Line Stage 1 construction ● The Stanley Milner Library reconstruction b. 103 Street between 103 and 104 Avenues will be impacted as a result of ongoing construction activities in the Ice District and will not be available until 2019. Due to the robustness of the network, this is accommodated by other north/south corridors. 4. The interim shared use path on 104 Avenue was suggested in the initial Downtown Bike Network concept as the north boundary of the Downtown Minimum Bike Network. This was initially proposed based on the understanding that the ultimate bike route would be permanently located on 105 Avenue as part of the future reconstruction of that avenue. 5. Current sidewalk operations have been flagged at Rogers Place (104 Avenue, between 105 and 101 Streets) and MacEwan Campus (104 Ave, between 110 St and 105 St) as a potential conflict between both bike, pedestrian/transit and facility operations. 6. Administration is currently developing a connected two-way, on street bike facility on 105 Avenue from 116 Street to 101 Street on the north side of 105 Avenue. This would connect the current bike facility in Queen Mary Park with an adaptable, on street route until such time that the planned 105 Avenue bike facility is completed as part of reconstruction of 105 Avenue in the future. 7. Implementation period for this change to the network is anticipated for Summer 2017. This will not affect opening of the remainder of the bike route south of 104 Avenue as there are no changes affecting that portion of the bike network. 8. While Administration is not currently conducting public engagement in relation to location and configuration, a communication and education plan is being developed as a component of the project. Communication to businesses and stakeholders began in March. A media launch is expected for early May. Information signs are currently being used along segments on the bike grid advertising of the upcoming construction and directing users to the City Web for more details. 9. The project team has assembled an external group of individuals and businesses to help identify how the grid fits and integrates successfully into the community. The group meets monthly to provide feedback on project implementation and issues. In addition to this memo to City Council, a project update has been posted on the City’s website and can be found here: https://www.edmonton.ca/projects_plans/downtown/bike-network.aspx Should you have any further questions or inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact Olga Messinis, Project Manager at (780) 944-5658.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton by Sustainable Development in 2016 as part of the Glenora Historic Resources Inventory project. Originally constructed in 1929, the Marshall Residence is significant for its representation of the nature of residential development in Glenora during the inter-war period, just prior to the start of the Great Depression. The home is valued as a well-designed example of an Arts and Crafts-style residence, with distinctive clinker brick cladding. The choice of clinker brick cladding was likely in part due to original owner Charles Marshall’s employment as an accountant at Edmonton’s Acme Brick Company Ltd. Clinker brick was a characteristic construction material in Edmonton in the 1910s and 1920s. The material had formerly been discarded due to its discoloured and often distorted appearance (when compared to conventional brick), but was sought after by Arts and Crafts proponents for its dramatic and hand-crafted form. The home’s one and one-half storey height, front-gabled roof with a front-gabled projection, projecting eaves, exposed rafter tails, clinker brick and stucco cladding and multi-assembly windows are all hallmarks of the Arts and Crafts design. The Marshall Residence is also significant for its association with prominent Edmonton building contractor Robert H. Rae (1892 – 1959), who constructed numerous dwellings in the Norwood, Calder, Highlands, Glenora and Virginia Park neighbourhoods. He arrived in Edmonton in 1907 and established RH Rae Contractors, which would later become RH Rae and Sons in the 1950s. Rae was an active community member, serving as president of the Alberta Avenue Community League, Canadian Home Builders Association, Edmonton Construction Association, and as a member of the Edmonton Public School Board. Many of Rae's distinctive clinker brick houses are still standing today, a testament to the integrity of his work. The owners have been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The owners have informed the Heritage Management Unit that they do not wish to designate the property. The existing house has had moderate water damage through the deteriorated brick foundation. The owner has also already removed the original clinker brick cladding from the exterior for future re-use. An application for subdivision to create two new 25-foot lots from the existing parcel was approved by the Subdivision Authority in October 2016. To date, the new subdivision has not been registered at Alberta Land Titles. The owners have advised that their intention is no longer to subdivide the parcel, but to develop a new single detached dwelling on the subject parcel instead. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires in that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value. For your information, this will be the eighth demolition of a property on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2017. A total of 12 properties on the Inventory of Historic Resources were demolished in 2016. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Sustainable Development will issue the permit following a period of one week. c: R.

The essence of the Valley Line LRT project is encompassed in the Project Agreement with TransEd and addresses most of the items that have been requested in the memo. The Project Agreement document is available for reference online at: https://www.edmonton.ca/projects_plans/valley_line_lrt/value-for-money-project-agreement.aspx Alternatively, if a hard copy is required, we can provide one, on request. 1. Project Agreement Sections The Project Agreement has separate sections for performance requirements (metrics) throughout the Construction Period and Operating Period. The attached list references the schedules and sections in the Agreement for many of the specific areas of interest that have been raised in the memo. 2. Finalized Design Packages With a P3 project the process and associated schedule for producing design packages is led by the proponent. TransEd is building the design packages based on the Design Guide created by the City and available online at: https://www.edmonton.ca/documents/RoadsTraffic/2014_valley_lrt_design_guide.pdf Engineering design packages are typically grouped by subject matter (e.g. drainage, structures, systems, etc) and are submitted for review, in stages, to Administration for specific pieces of infrastructure. During the revision stage Administration may request changes to the design packages, which sometimes results in the need for TransEd to modify their designs so that they are compliant with the Project Agreement. At this time TransEd has not yet produced a complete set of final design packages covering all of the engineering disciplines. For this reason the current state of overall design for the project is not considered “final” and will not be final until all drawings are produced for the various elements of infrastructure. However, design plans and renderings illustrating the design of the project will be produced for many elements of the project and they will be provided to council as they are made available to the City. 3. Davies Park & Ride Although not finalized, the initial parking plan may result in a minimum of 25% of the stalls (325 stalls of the total 1,300) being committed for reserved status on opening day of the new park and ride facility. This is based on the current allocation of paid park and ride stalls on existing lots. The final allocation of stalls at this facility will be determined by the demand that will be generated when the request for reserved stalls is completed three months (or 90 days) ahead of opening day. The percentage of reserved stalls will adjust over time with the life of the park and ride as demand warrants. In closing, Administration is currently creating a repository for Valley Line construction information so that information like the design plans can made available for Council as it is produced. It is expected that such a process could be in place by Quarter 2 and Administration will advise Council as soon as it is in place.

The City of Edmonton and Greyhound Canada have reached an arrangement that will allow Greyhound to provide a connection between their station (1 2360 - 121 S t.) and the City’s Kingsway Transit Centre ( 10560 Kingsway), starting September 17. A Greyhound coach will shuttle passengers between the bus station and the ETS transit centre 5-6 times per day, from 6:25 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. City Administration has worked closely with Greyhound to ensure scheduling alignment. The service transfer between the two facilities is free for passengers with a valid Greyhound bus ticket. Greyhound has signed a two-year renewable contract, effective August 14, 2017, for exclusive use of a City bus bay in the Kingsway Transit Centre. Greyhound is being charged a nominal fee because the arrangement is beneficial for passengers, City of Edmonton and Greyhound. Regular ETS bus operations will not be impacted by this sharing arrangement. Currently, the nearest ETS bus stop is located a kilometre away from the Greyhound bus station, which is situated in an area that lacks the infrastructure to provide transit service. The coach shuttle solution will now provide Greyhound passengers with a seamless connection to the ETS bus and LRT system at no cost to the City. More importantly, it ensures regional connectivity for passengers travelling locally, provincially and nationally. Greyhound and the City will jointly announce the arrangement. Greyhound will take the lead on communicating the new shuttle option to their passengers. The shuttle schedule will be posted to Greyhound’s website on September 17. Information will be posted online at takeETS.com . Should you need any further details, please contact ETS Branch Manager, Eddie Robar. DJ/CHM/mc c: Linda Sahli, City Clerk",,"No",,,

Multiple elements of the project ensured that Edmontonians can be confident that we are: 1. Ensuring a safe network . A road safety audit of the preliminary design of the bike facility was completed by an independent safety auditor. This ensured that the selected route provided the best protection possible for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. 2. Providing prompt access . Construction began in April. Because construction and opening were phased, sections of the network were opened on June 16. The majority of the network opened by June 23, and an additional segment opened on August 25. The remaining section (see below) is expected to open in October. 3. Responding to community concerns . One section of the network, 105 Avenue between 109 and 116 Streets, was adjusted to reflect residents’ concerns about accessibility. There are no sidewalks on 105 Avenue in that area, so the bike path has been built wider (3.25 metres instead of 3.1 metres) and designated as a shared use path. This section is expected to open in October in co-ordination with the Queen Mark Park neighborhood renewal. 4. Encouraging community participation. The Cycle in the City Bike Party was held on August 26, 2017. More than 700 people came to celebrate the work that the community and City have accomplished together, and the opening of bike network. The event provided opportunities for the community to learn about the changes on roadways to downtown, and to connect with bike related businesses and organizations. 5. Teaching cyclists and drivers how to navigate the network. Street team members have been educating cyclists, pedestrians and motorists about safe travel on and beside the bike network. This has included popups along the network providing demonstrations and information, interactive ride-along tours, and outreach and presentations to businesses and organizations in the downtown. Staff are also gathering feedback as part of the ongoing evaluation and monitoring program. 6. Raising awareness about the network. Online ads, social media, elevator ads, and pavement decals near downtown parking lots are in place for additional outreach to drivers and residents. 7. Evaluating citizen feedback. An online survey at Edmonton.ca/BikeDowntown is gathering feedback on pedestrian, cyclist and driver satisfaction on the Downtown Bike Network. It will continue until September 30, 2019. 8. Monitoring use and evaluating effectiveness. A third-party consultant is evaluating the effectiveness of the network, and will continue to do so through 2018. Early results show that usage is high and continuing to grow. Statistics are publicly reported online at Edmonton.ca/BikeDowntown . Two visual sign display counters showing ridership at the selected points are scheduled to be in place by late fall. 9. Maintaining a clear network. The bike lanes are regularly swept clean in conjunction with cleaning of downtown roads. Winter maintenance activities are planned so that the bike network is free of snow and ice and available all seasons. 10. Accountable . The project team will report back to Council in early 2018. Ongoing project updates and information will be posted at Edmonton.ca/Bikedownt own Should you have any further questions or inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact Olga Messinis, Project Manager at (780) 944-5658.

ETS’ 2016 annual Customer Satisfaction report will be released through the City of Edmonton’s Open Data in the coming weeks. Results show ETS continues to maintain an overall customer satisfaction at 76 percent. This puts Edmonton on par with, or higher than, other major Canadian cities offering public transit. Based on the latest publicly available customer satisfaction reports, Calgary had 72 percent satisfaction in 2015; Toronto Transit Commission had 76 percent satisfaction in 2016, and Vancouver averaged 67.5 percent satisfaction between bus and skytrain service in 2016. ETS does particularly well when it comes to on-board safety and customer service. Over 90 percent of customers said their bus or LRT operator was skillful and safe. Further 87 percent were satisfied with the customer service of operators, while over 85% felt safe while in transit though 79 percent felt safe waiting for transit. The top opportunities for improvement identified by customers in 2016 include better connections, bus on-time reliability, trip duration and bus frequency. As you may recall, following the 2016 City Auditor’s report, ETS has already taken significant steps to reallocate service hours in order to address some of the concerns about on-time reliability and trip duration. The first major reallocations changes took place in September 2016, followed by a second round in July 2017. These changes involved moving service hours from significantly underperforming routes to those experiencing overcrowding and regular delays. ETS plans to provide more real-time information such as bus arrival and departures times at transit centres to improve customer satisfaction. Further changes will be based on continual customer feedback along with findings from the Transit Strategy public engagement. The report also provided insight into the changing demographics of our customers. People aged 15 to 34 make up more than 50 percent of ETS customers and have higher expectations of transit service while seniors make up 8 percent of our riders and are highly satisfied with transit. This information is helpful for future outreach and public engagement strategies. A summary of the 2016 customer satisfaction report is attached.

Multiple City departments have been planning these changes over the past several years, as we look to revamp and enhance amenities in the heart of our City. High-profile changes will include the introduction of the Valley Line LRT, the new Stanley Milner Library, the rehabilitated pool and park area, new infrastructure and pedway solutions, and many other improvements that will take place between now and 2020. Attachment 1 provides an overview and map of the capital Civic Precinct Projects currently anticipated between 2017-2019. The City has received formal notice from TransEd that they intend to occupy the contractually agreed-to portion of Churchill Square and surrounding roadways beginning October 2, 2017 for construction associated with the Valley Line Southeast. This area will be fenced off and closed to the public, and includes: ● the southeast section of Churchill Square ● 99 Street from 102A Avenue to 102 Avenue lanned for this year includes: This closure will enable TransEd to construct the Churchill Connector (the building housing the vertical link between the Valley Line LRT and the Metro/Capital Line - see Attachment 2 ), an underground LRT power substation, and related works. This continuous closure is scheduled to last until April 30, 2019. The public will also notice some impacts to the underground LRT pedway area but access to the Churchill Station will remain open throughout construction. During the period of the identified closure for Valley Line Southeast, the City and external stakeholders are expected to deliver an additional eight projects, of varying scopes and scale, in and around the Civic Precinct. All projects in the Civic Precinct are being delivered through a coordinated effort to reach the goal of reopening Churchill Square by the summer of 2019, in time for festival season. Two of these projects include the Civic Precinct Surface and City Hall Fountain Rehabilitation. To maintain the physical condition and function of the site, the surfaces in City Hall Plaza and 102A Avenue will be replaced. The City Hall Fountain will also undergo construction in 2018 to addressing legislated safety and accessibility improvements.

The plan incorporates recommendations from a broader City Hall security audit completed in 2016. This security update serves to make an already safe environment even safer. The context for the update is that security breaches and threats to government buildings and elected officials have increased in urban locations around the world. Consequently, there is greater awareness of heightened risk. Administration reviewed many possible enhancements to broaden the focus of security from being primarily behind-the-scenes to being more preventative. The assessment included a review of security enhancement projects completed by other provincial and municipal jurisdictions. A two-phase implementation of security upgrades is planned for introduction at the first regular Council meeting on November 1st and the first regular Committee meeting on October 31st. The upgrades are: 1. In Council Chambers, a four-foot half wall will be added to separate Administration and Council from the public seating area. Access behind the wall area will be controlled via card access. The barrier is currently under construction and will be fully functional in November 2017. For the November 1st Council meeting, the card access feature will not be operational. The addition of a further glass half wall to the wall is an option that will be considered in the future. 2. Metal detectors and a screening program will be introduced at public entrances to Council Chambers beginning November 1st and the River Valley Room beginning October 31st, when Council or Committee meetings are in session. Initially, the time required for the public to enter Council Chambers and the River Valley Room may increase as citizens learn what items are prohibited from Chambers. A communications campaign to increase public and media awareness of the security enhancements will launch post-election. An issue briefing with key messages will be provided to Council in advance of the campaign’s launch. LDMC/plz c: Executive Leadership Team",,"Yes","2017-03-21T00:00:00.000","6.9","City Council"

The inquiry, which includes a large number of questions spanning many years, comes as a third party review into the June 16, 2017 boxing match between Adam Braidwood and Tim Hague is underway. Administration does not know when the story may air. City of Edmonton Position: In 2011 and 2012, based on Council's direction, the City of Edmonton made significant changes to the oversight of the ECSC, which have resulted in standardized operations that support the City and Commission's commitment to safety in combative sports. The City highlighted these changes in governance in providing a written response to CTV. Key Messages: • The City of Edmonton has made significant changes to the oversight of the ECSC which have resulted in standardized operations that support the City and Commission's commitment to safety in combative sports. • Allegations referenced by CTV are not consistent with the ECSC governance model now in place. • The City and ECSC are looking forward to the completion of the third party review into the boxing match between Adam Braidwood and Tim Hague. The review will examine the relevant facts pertaining to the incident and to identify any recommendations to improve safety at future combative sports. Approach: In seeking to maintain a positive relationship with CTV and to ensure CTV is informed of the significant background and efforts of the City on this issue, Administration provided an extensive written response. Administration declined a request for an on camera interview. Background: CTV News Edmonton requested a response from the City after it interviewed five individuals who have either worked for or with the Edmonton Combative Sports Commission. These individuals made a number of allegations against the ECSC, Executive Director Pat Reid 17(1) and Acting Executive Director David Aitken, spanning from 2010 to 2017. Although CTV did not provide dates or names for some of the allegations made, Administration made great efforts to be as responsive as possible within a short time period. We found that the allegations referenced are not consistent with the governance model now in place and shared this response with CTV. We were unable to provide answers relating to questions about the Hague event as doing so would affect our desire to allow the third party review to take place independent of City comment. The City and ECSC selected MNP LLP to conduct a third party review into the June 16, 2017 boxing match between Adam Braidwood and Tim Hague. Hague died two days after the fight. The review will be complete later this fall. The City and ECSC will release the recommendations to the public, subject to any legislative requirements to protect the privacy of any affected individuals.

The Audit is conducted every two years by News Media Canada on freedom-of-information programs at all levels of government. It is conducted anonymously and our Corporate Access and Privacy staff were not aware of which requests were sent by News Media Canada. This is a tremendous result for the program as it demonstrates our commitment to one of the pillars of democracy: the right to access records of government. In addition to receiving an A on this audit, over the past three years the Corporate Access and Privacy Program has successfully responded to a significant and continued increase in access requests.

Hyvar® X-L is a federally regulated herbicide that sterilizes the soil from vegetation growth. While it poses no health risk to people and animals, the herbicide has adverse affects on plants with root systems that come in contact with soil that has been sprayed with it. City staff used Hyvar® X-L between 2014 and 2016 for controlling weeds on hard surfaces including traffic meridians, LRT track, and industrial areas. The use of the herbicide was discontinued after June 2016. Pathways at Todd Landing/Todd Court in Terwillegar Towne and Hector Road in Haddow will be closed temporarily for remediation work, starting November 6. Crews will excavate, dispose of and replace portions of soil along the pathways. Work will take up to three weeks depending on weather and ground conditions. Residents closest to the pathways may experience noise and dust during daylight hours, and heavy equipment may be present in the streets. Both pathways will be usable when reopened, but additional landscaping work may occur in the spring. Four private properties may have experienced negative impacts related to the product.

As the project was initiated under the previous Council, this memo is intended to inform new Councillors and update returning members of Council. Background West Rossdale is primarily City-owned land whose future has been discussed for many years. In 2011, Council approved the West Rossdale Urban Design Plan and related amendments to the Rossdale Area Redevelopment Plan. The thrust was to redevelop West Rossdale into a mixed-use urban village with 1700 - 2100 dwelling units. Implementation was initiated, but later curtailed as a result of costs and concerns that the Urban Design Plan had not addressed important conditions for the success of the redevelopment, including altering the transportation network, assessing whether the baseball park (now called RE/MAX Field) should remain, and determining an appropriate future use for the Rossdale Power Plant (a designated Provincial Historic Resource). In 2015, Council held a special workshop that resulted in a new vision for West Rossdale as a unique place in Edmonton and directed that a project called River Crossing be initiated to inform the vision. Council requested two deliverables: a Heritage Interpretive Plan to guide how history and culture will be reflected as the area evolves over time and a Business Plan with an updated redevelopment concept and supportive business case factoring in both financial analysis and city-building considerations. Current Status The Heritage Interpretive Plan is now complete. After extensive consultation with the general public, and Indigenous communities and related organizations, it was approved by Council on July 11, 2017. Administration is now working on the Business Plan. Stantec has been retained to prepare the new redevelopment concept and a second consultant is being engaged to assist with the business case aspects. Public and stakeholder engagement is also commencing. A drop-in workshop is being held November 29, 2017, to publicly kick-off the business planning process. A Community Advisory Committee has been established with representation from Edmonton’s economic development, tourism, heritage, design, arts, conservation and trail user communities plus the Rossdale Community League. Meetings with the project’s Business Advisory Group have resumed after a hiatus resulting from a change in project personnel and a renewed focus on project governance. However, some members of the Business Advisory Group have expressed their concerns in this regard. Administration is now working to review and consolidate the prior work of the Business Advisory Group to develop draft objectives and principles for review by both the Business Advisory Committee and the recently formed Community Advisory Committee. Once validated, the objectives and principles will be used by consultants to prepare redevelopment scenarios that will be shared with the committees, and the public in Q1 2018. Through the above, Administration is seeking to optimize the time and quality of the planning process while ensuring engagement is inclusive and appropriate to the scale of a transformational project. Administration continues to be committed to engaging Indigenous communities and related organizations and will be reaching out to communities about the Business Plan this year, with formal engagement planned in Q1 2018 to talk about concept options. Internally, River Crossing is being overseen by a director-level steering committee with representatives from across Administration. Conclusion River Crossing is at the heart of our city. It is a place of deep Indigenous significance. As the birthplace of Edmonton and Alberta, and the site of early community and economic activity, it is also a place of historical interest to many Edmontonians. It has the potential to become an important part of our future as well; a future where we collectively (re)define who we are as a community; a future that honours the past and shapes a cherished, welcoming and beloved place in our iconic river valley. We look forward to working with you as this important project continues. If you have any questions, please let me or the project manager, Erik Backstrom, know.

In both cases, train routing occurred which caused a situation preventing either train from moving to the next station. In these cases, safety was not an issue, however, it did result in delays to some customers. LRT Operations have taken steps to help prevent any reoccurrence and the signal contractor (Thales) is actively investigating these situations. City of Edmonton Position: The safety of drivers, riders, and pedestrians is a top priority when it comes to operating the LRT system. ETS regularly makes operational decisions throughout the transit system to account for changing conditions and operational issues that arise. Key Messages: ● Operating a safe and efficient LRT system is a top priority for the City of Edmonton. ● There were two incidents today where track signals failed, preventing trains on the Metro line at the NAIT station from moving to the next station. In neither incident was safety compromised. ● Thales, whose signalling system the LRT uses, is on site investigating. ● The City of Edmonton continues to deal with Thales to address ongoing deficiencies on the Metro line. These deficiencies are quality issues, not safety issues. ● The Metro Line will continue to operate at a slower speed until these issues are resolved. Approach : The City will respond to media and citizen inquiries. ETS does not generally publicize operating instructions that have minimal impact to service. Background: The City of Edmonton has a number of consulting firms overseeing the installation and testing of the Thales signal system and also brought in Rail Safety Consulting (RSC) as a Third-party consultant to provide auditing services on the safety case. Incident #1: at approximately 6:30 am today, a train signal failed. Both trains stopped, with one reversing until it reached the switch to get back on the other track. There was no delay in service. Incident #2: at approximately 2 pm today, a track signal failed and two trains were delayed by 7- 9 minutes in both directions. They were back on schedule within approximately 30 minutes. In neither incident was safety compromised.

Transit users are being informed that Capital and Metro Line trains will run every 20 minutes, instead of the regu lar 15 minute service on this day. Metro Line trains will operate between Bay/Enterprise and NAIT stations only, so customers will need to use the Capital Line to transfer at Bay/Enterprise station. This temporary service adjustment allows crews to safely complete work at track-level. Trains will also use Track 1 at Corona and Bay/Enterprise station, and Track 2 at Mckernan/Belgravia for both travel directions while crews complete work. The LRT arrival signs wi ll be turned off. However, schedule information is available through 311 , the Transit Trip Planner on takeETS.com, and third-party apps.

ETS completes a series of projects throughout the year to maintain the functionality of the almost 40 year old Capital Line LRT system. These projects typica lly include track-level maintenance work and/or cleaning. In order to minimize service impact, track work is usually scheduled on weekends where there is lower ridership demand or no major events.

The final recommendation will also identify the location of the connecting roads, land requirements, cost estimates and recommend necessary updates to area structure plans. In 2016, the City of Edmonton, Alberta Transportation, Strathcona County, City of Fort Saskatchewan, and Sturgeon County identified the need to conduct this study expeditiously, although the planned construction schedule is likely 25 or more years from now. The City of Edmonton, Alberta Transportation and these municipalities are joint planning and funding partners. Study Process and Schedule In September 2016, the City of Edmonton retained a planning consultant to conduct this study. The study commenced in October 2016 and is on schedule for completion by December 2018. The study includes the following phases: ● Phase 1: Study Appraisal (October 2016 to April 2017) - Understand study area conditions, constraints and opportunities (COMPLETED) ● Phase 2: Option Development (May 2017 to February 2018) - Develop and evaluate potential bridge crossing and roadway options ● Phase 3: Recommended Alignment (February 2018 to December 2018) - Identify and develop the recommended bridge crossing location and roadway alignments Phase 2 is underway and five roadway options have been developed - three in the City of Edmonton and two in Strathcona County. Any combination of the City of Edmonton and Strathcona County roadway options is possible. In Phase 3, one combination of these options will be identified, along with the bridge crossing location. The draft roadway options are attached for information. Public Engagement Public engagement is being conducted to gather input from those directly impacted by the study, including landowners and residents, as well as the public, businesses, community groups and non-profit groups. Opportunities to provide input have included one-on-one meetings with residents impacted by the study, and two public meetings. Input is being used to inform our understanding of the study area, to inform the development and selection of options, and will be used to refine the recommended plan. Upcoming Meetings On November 20, 2017, draft alignment options will be shared with residents directly impacted by the draft bridge and roadway alignments. The attached options address a variety of input from these stakeholders differently, and impacted stakeholders have requested the opportunity to meet directly with the project team to share their concerns and input prior to the general public. To help ensure this meeting is successful, we request the attached options be kept confidential until November 20 . Two public meetings are planned on November 21 and 22, to share the draft options and gather input to inform the selection of a recommended alignment.

The enclosed attachment is Arts Recommendation #2; the four actions listed were completed by 2012 . Since 2012, Administration has advanced work related to the Zoning Bylaw and Business Licenses as noted below. Zoning Bylaw ● Arts Habitat held consultations in 2010 to 2011 with the arts community and other key stakeholders which resulted in Zoning Bylaw amendments being prepared that addressed issues identified in “Review of Art Space Issues in Edmonton” , a summary report prepared by the Arts Habitat Association and is available at: https://d10k7k7mywg42z.cloudfront.net/assets/507f29d4dabe9d7acc001da6/aolreport_ fulljul2011.pdf . ● The proposed amendments approved at a public hearing on September 10, 2012; Zoning Bylaw 12800 was amended. T he amendments included two main changes: the modification of existing use class definitions to acknowledge arts-related uses, and the addition of arts-related use classes to commercial and industrial zones where appropriate. ● Recent Zoning Bylaw changes that have benefited arts groups include: ○ A reduction in parking requirements in established main street and transit areas will remove barriers for artists and cultural groups wishing to move into these areas (September 11, 2017, Public Hearing, Bylaw 18171). ○ Removal of parking requirements for any adaptive reuse of heritage buildings in the downtown, and for changes of use from commercial to live-work units downtown (September 11, 2017, Public Hearing, Bylaw 18171). Business Licensing Reduction of Fees ● In 2011 Arts Habitat and Administration met regarding Business Licensing as a result fees were reduced: ● Minor Home Based Business fees were reduced from $172 to $50. ● The total cost for a Minor Home Based Business was reduced to $270 per year (prior to 2011 it was $392 per year). ● Non-profit organizations also qualified to have their business license fee reduced from $220/year to $41/year. Decision Guide ● In 2012 a new online process, called a “Decision Guide” was explored to provide clearer information on who needs to obtain a business licence and how to obtain one. Administration worked with Arts Habitat to ensure that artists and arts definitions would be included in this guide. ● In June 2015 a full re-evaluation of eService occurred and the Decision Guide was dropped from the program scope; instead, a new initiative called ""Open Window"" was created to help small businesses (including art production, performance and sale) understand requirements/fees to opening businesses and to help explore location options. Information on Open Window is located on the City’s website at: www.edmonton.ca/business_economy/business_resources/starting-a-business.aspx Processes and Regulations ● Administration is working with small market coordinators and vendors to update business licensing processes and regulations. A Council report is scheduled for first quarter of 2018. Live Music Initiative ● On May 23, 2017, an overview of the City’s Live Music Initiative and consideration of potential pilot initiatives by Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission to extend operating hours was provided to Executive Committee (Report CR_4336). Further changes to regulations to support the arts will be considered as part of the Zoning Bylaw Renewal project (scheduled for January 2018 - Spring 2021) and the B usiness Licence Bylaw 13138 updates (scheduled for 2018/2019); consultation with arts groups as well as other community stakeholders will be included as part of the process.

Respectful Workplace Administrative Directive CA1127) This directive out lines appropriate behaviours and behaviours considered harassment and discrimination, along with a process for receiving and resolving complaints. Administration has prepared a visual representation of the process for responding to employee complaints. This roadmap (Attachment 1) represents the process as it existed prior to the November 20 Audit Committee. Following the November 20 Audit Committee meeting, Administration has now put in place an interim process for responding to harassment and discrimination complaints and concerns. The memo to Council ""Update on Information on Harassment and Discrimination Process"" (Attachment 2) outlines the interim process that is now in place. Fraud and Whistleblower Protection Administrative Directive CA1464) The purpose of th is directive is to prescribe procedures for the prevention, detection, reporting and investigation of suspected fraud, as well as the processes for reporting and re solving complaints of retaliation. Fraud Reporting and Investigation Reports of suspected fraud can be made orally or in writing by employees to a variety of recipient s, including the City's fraud and misconduct hotline. Once reports are received, the Office of the City Auditor conducts a review and either directly investigates or refers to the appropriate administrat ive unit for investigation, which includes, but is not limited to, Human Resources (Labour Relations) and Corporate Security. Whistleblower Protection Should an employee believe that retaliation has occurred, a written complaint must be submitted to the City Manager, who will assign an Independent Reviewer to investigate. Should the complaint implicate the City Manager, the employee should submit the written complaint to the City Auditor. For more detailed information, see Attachments 3 and 4, which outline the procedures related to whistleblower protection and fraud reporting and investigation. These directives and processes (Fraud Reporting and Investigation and Whistleblower Protection) have not been altered following the November 20, 2017 Audit Committee meeting. Employees may also use the City's hotline, which is available 24 hours per day, seven days a week and all year round. If a report pertains to potential fraud or misconduct that requires investigation by the Office of the City Auditor (OCA), the investigation will be conducted in accordance with investigation standards. Reports related to harassment and discrimination were previously sent to Labour Relations for investigation. They will now be sent directly to the external resource supporting the interim process for harassment and discrimination complaints and concerns outlined in Attachment 2.

The Project is divided in two phases: Corridor Identification Phase and Concept Design Phase. Presentations to City Council will occur for both phases as part of a non-statutory public hearing process. The Project will include information on the preferred route selection, stop locations and concept design of the LRT and the roadway. A short overview and update are provided in the Attachment . The starting points for this study are: ● The need for a central LRT route as identified in the City’s Long Term LRT Network Plan (2009) that will connect Downtown with Strathcona/University, Bonnie Doon, and eventually east Edmonton ● The route will connect with the Valley Line in both the Bonnie Doon area and Downtown ● The LRT system will be low-floor urban style The public engagement process is strategically designed to involve the public in the conversation before key decisions are made. This allows the public the opportunity to provide input on the route selection in the earliest stage. Since June 2017, the project team has held three open houses and met with a number of community, business and industry stakeholders. Based on the level of stakeholder feedback received during this first phase of the Project, the Project timeline has been adjusted to allow for additional stakeholder engagement and technical analysis. Administration will recommend the route to be on Whyte Avenue instead of 76 Avenue, however additional technical analysis is needed for the river crossing and tie-ins with the Valley Line LRT areas of the emerging route. As part of this additional analysis, the impacts of building the Centre LRT route in stages will be reviewed. The preferred Centre LRT route is planned to be presented in February 2018 for public feedback (postponed from November 2017 due to the requirement for further analysis) and at an April 2018 City Council Public Hearing. Next, the project will enter into the concept planning phase, which will provide additional opportunities for the public to be involved in the process to shape the design , including providing feedback on stop locations and alignment (i.e. where the tracks fit within the recommended route). The concept plan will be presented for public feedback in fall 2018 and to City Council for final consideration and approval in Q1 2019. As key milestones of the Centre LRT Study are reached, the project team will continue to provide City Council and key Committees important information. We trust this will provide you with the additional information you may need to understand the current status and proposed approach for this project. The Centre LRT Bulletin will be shared via maildrop and will be posted on the website as a project update.

This memo is relevant to a service package for Downtown District Energy within the Supplementary Budget scheduled for Council December 5, 2017. Members of this committee will register to be available for questions as required on December 6, 2017 at the Non-Statutory Public Hearing. While the sub-committee meeting held November 23, 2017 from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. was useful there were insufficient details provided for the subcommittee in several significant areas which were viewed as material to the project. In addition, specific examples of local and recent projects were provided by the subcommittee members that suggested a very different approach be taken as a first step for the buildings targeted in Phase 1 of the District Energy system buildout. The subcommittee would be comfortable with a recommendation to proceed with the proposed $1.6M Downtown District Energy detailed design investment provided the following concerns are addressed as part of that work: 1. Explore the costs and benefits of deep energy retrofits combined with an evaluation of the costs and benefits of on-site combined cooling, heat and power systems, for the buildings identified in the proposed Phase 1 of the Downtown District Energy system (assess both City-owned and privately owned buildings). 2. A clear assessment and confirmation that the mechanism employed to account for the carbon reductions associated with the District Energy system will accrue to the City of Edmonton at the building level for those buildings that they own. 3. An evaluation of rate structures for the District Energy system to confirm they will account for (and allow) any future energy savings initiatives that are undertaken at the building level in the franchise area, without financial penalty. 4. A complete and transparent evaluation of the franchise agreement for the downtown District Energy system to confirm it will not restrict or economically hinder any future community energy systems that may be introduced or pursued by other market actors (for any shared heating or cooling within a group of buildings as well as at the individual building level). 5. That the Downtown District Energy system agreements and design be revised to incorporate findings of the above elements as applicable. 6. That an independent review of the findings be prepared for City of Edmonton as part of the final evaluation process. Below are additional details that led to recommendations in the short list above: 1. It was identified by a number of subcommittee members that the buildings identified are cooling dominated, and therefore the greatest opportunity for emissions reduction must include a cooling component. The subcommittee acknowledges that there is a long history on this project, but suggests that consideration of this District Energy system only be contemplated after the costs and benefits of investing in building envelope improvements and on site combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) generation are better understood (for both public and private buildings). It was suggested that the same (or greater) energy savings and emissions reductions could be achieved with a single project for one of the City buildings with an improved economic return. This concept could be proven out by formally evaluating one of the City owned/leased buildings in Phase 1 (Shaw, Winspear, Citadel) for its energy retrofit and on-site, building level CCHP potential. Additional support programs for the private sector to pursue building level retrofits and CCHP should also be explored (e.g. Property Assessed Clean Energy financing). 2. There is a potential monetary value associated with greenhouse gas reductions initiatives (reduced consumption, alternative energy generation); however, it is not clear how this value has been incorporated in the calculations for return on investment. With respect to the City of Edmonton owned assets, any carbon reductions would need to be accounted for at the building level and applied towards its own greenhouse gas inventory. It is likely that any value proposition of the District Energy system for other building owners in the franchise area would be similar. 3. The subcommittee was also concerned that the","rate structure for the District Energy system could possibly ‘lock-in’ a minimum level of energy demand and create a disincentive for the pursuit of potential future energy efficiency improvements. The rate structure cannot be allowed to hinder those energy reductions or future energy cost savings. The advantage stated for many District Energy systems is the use of co-generated heat and power fueled from either a renewable or very low carbon energy source (e.g. geothermal system such as one would find in Iceland where thermal energy for heating is readily available, or a combined heat and power or CCHP system). The proposed Edmonton Downtown District Energy system is missing both the components of renewable energy and combined heat and power (at least in the early phases) as well as also missing the cooling element which makes the proposition similar in emissions profile to traditional sources of heat. Any business case for a District Energy system would need to address these deficiencies if it is to be seen as as significant emissions reduction initiative. 4. The subcommittee members were extremely concerned with the potential situation whereby the City of Edmonton grants a franchise area for District Energy (or smaller community energy systems) to any single party and thereby remove the potential for a property developer to create their own shared system within a group of buildings (the campus style District Energy is becoming more common where buildings share mechanical systems on smaller scale than a typical District Energy system). 5. The ETAC subcommittee was not provided with an analysis of alternative approaches to District Energy to reduce greenhouse gases, minimize energy use and realize cost savings in Edmonton’s downtown. It is suggested that, at a minimum, the cost savings and greenhouse gas reductions associated with retrofitting (with building level CCHP) for the City owned buildings in Phase I be evaluated and this compared to the the cost and benefits associated with the proposed District Energy system. It appears that not improving the efficiency or resiliency of the buildings is critical to a supportive business case for District Energy. A complete analysis of the emissions differential between the installation of high efficiency condensing boilers and/or CCHP vs. the connection to the District Energy systems is critical to understanding the value case at the building level. This analysis may already be available, but the subcommittee would like to reiterate that it is critical in determining the emissions advantage (if any) of the District Energy system. 6. The subcommittee recommends the use of an independent third party reviewer. Such a thorough review would assess not only the new material recommended above but also those details not available to the ETAC subcommittee (proprietary, competitively sensitive, etc.). The City of Edmonton has committed to the creation and use of a District Energy system for the Blatchford project, and this has been supported by the Energy Transition Advisory Committee. The ETAC subcommittee on Downtown District Energy supports this approach as well. One of the biggest differences between the downtown District Energy system and the one serving Blatchford is that the structures in Blatchford will be new and built to a much higher standard than the existing City buildings in the downtown core. The buildings in the downtown core should be improved first (e.g. building envelope improvements), reducing the demand for heating and cooling while delivering increased energy and emission savings and resiliency, per dollar invested. cc: Linda Sahli Gary Klassen Adam Laughlin Todd Burge Brian Latte Paul Ross ETAC Members ETAC Webpage on City of Edmonton Website https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/energy-transition-committee.aspx","Yes","2017-12-06T00:00:00.000","6.2","City Council"

All Civic Precinct adjacent projects are being delivered through a coordinated and integrated effort in order to reopen Churchill Square in time for festival season in summer 2019. This update is a follow-up to the September 22, 2017 Notice of Partial Closure memorandum, which provides additional background information on the efforts around rehabilitating this important public space. Background - Civic Precinct Surface and Fountain Renewal In 2015, the project was initiated with the consideration to: rehabilitate the failing surface surrounding City Hall; resurface the 102A Avenue roadway (between 99-100 Street) in order to integrate City Hall Plaza and Churchill Square; and renew the East Garden by replacing the turf with a durable surface treatment that could sustain the heavy use by festivals, events, and public activity. In 2016, an additional objective was added to rehabilitation the 25 year-old City Hall Fountain in order to repair infrastructure at the end of its lifecycle and to upgrade the mechanical systems to current Alberta Health Services standards. Project Goals The project goals include: providing a safe public area; creating barrier-free spaces; increasing pedestrian access; installing durable and timeless materials; maintaining the urban tree canopy; considering child-friendly opportunities; and providing vibrancy during all four seasons while maintaining activities such as skating, wading, programs, festivals, and events. Project Budget The current approved project budget is $13 million for Phase 1, which includes the design development of the fountain renewal, the surface areas around City Hall Plaza and perimeter, the integration of 102A Avenue, and the East Gardens. Phase 1 also includes construction delivery of the fountain rehabilitation, the City Hall plaza surface renewal, and the integration of 102A Avenue. Phase 2 construction is currently unfunded and includes the completion of surface renewal for City Hall perimeter and the East Garden. Schedule and Stakeholder Engagement Construction work on the City Hall plaza resurfacing and fountain renewal will be coordinated with adjacent projects to minimize public impacts. Construction completion is expected in 2019. The City has been and remains in communication with area stakeholders, multi-day festivals, and events that license the square and surrounding areas. All parties are aware of the upcoming construction impacts. Stakeholder meetings are held quarterly and additional updates are provided when new information becomes available. Phase 1 Project Details (funded) 1. City Hall Plaza: ● Replace existing pavers. ● U niversal accessibility is a primary design feature. ● Improve the sub base to support the diverse use of the Civic Precinct area. ● Install new granite pavers and bring in the colour pallet from City Hall’s red granite columns and floor within the doorways. The colour will gradually shift from a deep red granite at City Hall to a light grey towards Churchill Square. 2. City Hall Fountain: ● The current fountain was not designed as a wading pool and does not currently meet Alberta Building Code requirements. ● The rehabilitation priority is to retain wading use in the summer and skating in the winter. ● The new fountain basin will be flush with the surface of the plaza to allow barrier-free entrance from the north and the south ends. ● The new pool depth will be six inches to limit safety and maintenance issues, and to increase the programing potential of the pool space. There will also be a new mechanical system for water treatment to meet Alberta Health Services requirements for public wading pools. ● The arch fountain fixtures will be maintained along the pool edge but will be flush with the paving surface. ● The fountain will retain its function as a natural ice rink during the winter months. Additionally glycol lines will be reinstalled within the fountain base to support an opportunity for chilled ice in the future. ● Seating will be included along both sides of the fountain. 3. Tree Colonnade: ● Replace trees in ill health along the pool. ● Move the placement of new trees away from the pool for ease of movement, to reduce the impact on trees from fountain over-spray, and to keep tree debris from the fountain. Phase 2 Project Details (unfunded) 1. City Hall Perimeter: ● Re","Replace existing pavers. ● U niversal accessibility is a primary design feature. ● Install new granite pavers and align with new colour pallet from City Hall and Phase 1 Surface Renewal. 2. East Garden: ● Wood decking and wooden benches will maintain the feeling of soft landscaping and increase usability while requiring less maintenance than sod. ● Create a barrier-free shaded location for a more intimate experience of the civic space. ● Maintain all healthy existing trees. ● Increase accessibility and refine the edge condition to better connect 99 Street to the central plaza area. Other Information Input from the Child Friendly Edmonton Committee was gathered during the development of the concept and schematic design phase. The project is exploring elements to be incorporated into the East Garden Surface rehabilitation that may introduce play and interpretive elements. Opportunities for child play can be provided in many ways and is not limited to play structures or formal play opportunities.

As a result, we recently received notice that two builders’ liens were registered against title of the Blatchford lands. On December 1, 2017, Norwood Waterworks and EMCO Corporation registered liens. We have also been advised by the general contractor that two other builders’ lien are in the process of being registered, Lafarge Canada Inc. and Canwest Concrete Cutting & Coring Inc.. A builders’ lien is a charge against a parcel of land. It is designed by legislation to provide contractors/subcontractors, who supplied labour or materials to improve that land, with a form of security. It secures amounts that have not been fully paid for the work supplied. Builders’ liens in construction projects are not uncommon. The contract with our general contractor contains a number of provisions that are designed to protect the City’s interests in the event that a lien is filed. As contemplated in our contract, the City maintains a builders’ lien holdback to limit the City’s exposure to claims such as this. Further, payments to the general contractor have been suspended until the liens are removed. Presently, these issues are being investigated and work towards having these liens removed is underway.

Protocols were updated this year, thanks to the collaborative effort of the Winter Emergency Response (WER) committee, which includes Homeward Trust, several local service agencies and the City of Edmonton. Homeward Trust will take the lead on calling an Extreme Weather Event. They will identify the need for expanded shelter space or use of alternative shelters and potentially request Central LRT station to be opened from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. This year, the procedures and client guidelines at the Central LRT station shelter will better align with those of local shelters in order to help keep users safe and secure. There will also be resources at Central LRT to provide support, including: ● 24/7 Crisis Diversion, ● Emergency Medical Services, and ● Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) Peace Officers. Churchill LRT station is not accessible this winter due to major construction. It’s anticipated local shelters will be able to handle demand for beds during most extreme weather events. Based on data collected during the winter last year, Edmonton shelters were not full during the nights of extreme weather. People will be encouraged to first go to a local shelter because they offer more warmth and support services than alternative shelters. The Winter Emergency Response committee has shared the changes in protocols with service agencies and shelters, along with updated reference materials. Those groups are passing the information along to people in need of shelter. ETS will follow Homeward Trust’s lead on when to open the the Central LRT station as a shelter. In addition, to help people get to a local shelter during an extreme weather event, fares can be waived for those who self-identify as needing to get to shelter. ETS’ existing protocols include having most express buses pick up/drop off passengers at every bus stop during extreme weather events.

During this stage we have spent time synthesizing the results of our public engagement in the spring (captured in the What We Heard report) with the findings from our three technical reports. The technical reports include a market study, a historical report on Edmonton’s neighbourhood and housing evolution, and a municipal tools report. Our internal working group made up of colleagues from multiple branches and departments has been instrumental in helping us integrate all of the data and findings into a first set of potential infill actions. We will be publishing documents online by the end of December in an effort to provide at least one month for the public and stakeholders to review all of the project materials before we initiate the second round of public engagement in January. Included in the publication package will be: ● Draft list of potential infill actions ● Draft What We Heard - Phase 2 Stakeholder Engagement Results ● Draft Edmonton's Urban Planning, Neighbourhood and Housing Evolution Report ● Draft Municipal Tools Review ● Draft Market Housing and Affordability Study Stage 4: Public Review and Discussion will be launched in mid-January, with engagement events beginning in late January. We expect to have engagement opportunities of various kinds, geared towards diverse groups with varying degrees of knowledge on infill issues. To be clear, this stage of engagement will be iterative and is about building upon the feedback to refine and improve the potential list of infill actions.

This contribution is authorized through the Transit Fare Assistance Program Strategy Report (2001TS0998) dated October 19, 2001 and approved by City Council on November 27, 2001. According to The City of Edmonton’s Chief Corporate Economist, the 2018 population forecast for Edmonton proper is 969,000. The 2017-2018 ticket contribution is therefore calculated to be 58,140 ETS adult tickets. This results in a 2,700 (4.9 per cent) increase from the previous year’s campaign. Typically the Donate-a-Ride Steering Committee makes the ticket allocation decisions in March or April. Marvin Babiuk, ETS Business Integration, will make arrangements to access these tickets and to package them according to the approved allocations. The growth in demand for this program reminds us of the value and importance DONATE-A-RIDE has to the community who require help in accessing public transportation services.

Edmonton was the first Canadian city to adopt Vision Zero and has long been committed to traffic safety as part of Council's traffic safety initiative. Vision Zero initiatives in other Canadian and USA cities continue to grow and has attracted local interest in developing greater involvement in the private sector. Lafarge Canada Inc. and ATS Traffic, two companies with strong local connections have asked the City of Edmonton to host a Vision Zero Symposium to determine interest from other corporate and industry entities who may also support building momentum and advocacy for Vision Zero. Thirty to fifty companies who are interested in learning more about Vision Zero and have local, provincial, national and international business interests will participate in a one day event which will be hosted on the 21 February, 2018 by the City of Edmonton. International, national and local presenters will share the Vision Zero principles, identify locations where Vision Zero has been successful, share leading research on connected vehicles and plattooning of commercial vehicles and facilitate discussion on the creation of a corporate and industry entity to advocate and support Vision Zero. Many of the invited companies and industry participants have strong corporate safety cultures and practices which they are willing to share to increase leading and best practice on corporate safety programs.

Media Release - Research Edmonton: Safe City (UN Women Program) On April 21, 2016, City Council approved a motion to apply for membership in the .United Nations Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces Flagship Programme. With that decision, and in partnership with the Government of Alberta's ministry of Status of Women, Edmonton became the second Canadian city to be part of this program. Member cities begin their work by conducting a scoping study to develop a clearer picture of sexual violence in public spaces. A robust qualitative study is complete, complemented by quantitative research. The three theme areas that emerged from the research are: 1. The ways people move including but not limited to public transit, taxis and ride-sharing services as sites for sexual violence 2. Indigenous women and girls as a group that is particularly at risk 3. Responding to and reporting sexual violence Citizen Services has shared the research findings with internal lines of business most impacted including Edmonton Transit Services and Edmonton Police Service. A joint public release with Status of Women on Edmonton's research is planned for March 2018. Additionally, the United Nations Women Global Forum event will be announced at that time. Administration is already responding to the three theme areas. Examples of this work are included below. Transportation • Recent safety awareness campaign Respect All on transit. • Ongoing public safety programs such as Transit Watch and Stop Request. • Security measures including Transit Peace Officers & Closed Circuit Television. • Sexual violence awareness training for Transit Peace Officers. Indigenous Women • Administration supported the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in November 2017.

After consulting with my staff in Edmonton Transit Service (ETS}, I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide the following information: As you know, the Ride Transit Program was approved by City Council as a pilot program in May 2017 with funding coming from both the City of Edmonton and Government of Alberta until December 2018. Both parties worked together to establish eligibility for the subsidized monthly transit pass. The grant agreement states approval for the pilot program will be based on the annual Low-Income Cut Off levels as defined by Statistics Canada. The Ride Transit Program primarily accepts an income tax statement or Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) health card as valid proof of income. Minister Sabir requested the City also consider the provincial Income Support health benefit card as proof as income for the Ride Transit Program. Provincial Income Support provides monthly financial assistance to Albertans who do not have the resources to meet their basic needs, like food, clothing and shelter. Program participants are assessed and issued a monthly health benefit card by the Province. Assessing Ride Transit eligibility on a monthly basis versus an annual basis is expected to significantly increase demand. Approximately 9,800 Ride Transit subsidized passes were sold in December and this amount has been increasing each month. Therefore, on sales alone, the program cost is expected to exceed its budget of $8.0 million in 2018, which was based on a maximum of 10,800 Ride Transit passes per month. Administration supports expanding the scope of the Ride Transit Program to include individuals on the Provincial Income Support program as funding permits. Administration is bringing a report on this matter to Council in February 2018. Administration also recognizes that Ride Transit customers with disabilities have expressed a desire to receive the Ride Transit pass in a manner that is safe and easy for them. Our procedures require that the Ride Transit pass eligibility is verified and payment is made prior to the issuance of the pass. There are a number of agents throughout the city that are authorized to verify eligibility and issue passes. Regardless, those users with mobility challenges often face difficulties in accessing these agents. Administration is exploring solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens, though an answer on how to verify eligibility remotely remains a challenge.

The Energy Transi tion Strategy ca lls for increased electrification of Edmonton's transportation system with passenger vehicles, buses, light trucks and trains powered by clean electricity. Electri fying transportation takes advantage of a greening Alberta electricity grid, helping to reduce Edmonton's community greenhouse gas emissions. At the September 28, 2016, Urban Planning Committee meeting a motion was passed that directed Administration to develop a strategy for electric vehicles, including an infrastructure plan and relevant metrics, targets and outcomes. Although the strategy has been developed, to ensure proper alignment with other developing policy documents, it will be presented to Council in 2018 at the end of the third quarter, in conjunction with the Smart Transportation Action Plan coordinated by Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development (being developed in response to the Urban Planning Committee motion made on September 6, 2017). The Smart Transportation Action Plan will provide direction on an integrated City response to emerging transportation technology, including automated, connected, shared and electric vehicles. Update on Curbside Electric Vehicle Charging Station Demonstration Project In an effort to continue to advance the goals of the Energy Transition Strategy, the City has partnered with ATCO Electricity to install up to 10-Level 2 on-street electric vehicle charging stations in high density, retail and commercial areas in Edmonton (this was previously conveyed to Council in a September 18, 2017 memorandum). Prelim inary design work is underway and a list of proposed host sites has been developed. Key stakeholders, including businesses, organizations and associations have been identified and will be engaged once sites are prioritized and vetted for technica l feasibility. A Communication Plan is being jointly prepared by ATCO and the City of Edmonton that identi fies the key messages and the methods to be used to communicate to Edmontonians about the project. The target date to begin construction is early 2018 with installation of all of the stations targeted for completion by the end of the second quarter of 2018.

ETS ticket packs remain valid if they were purchased prior to February 1, 2018 and have not expired. Cash fares, the Route 747 monthly pass, the Ride Transit Program subsidized monthly transit pass, and the Universal Transit Pass (U-Pass) remain the same. The new fares represent an average increase of approximately three per cent. Details on fare adjustments are in the attached document. On December 6, 2017 City Council approved new fares for the Route 747 between Century Park transit centre and the Edmonton International Airport. Effective February 1, 2018, a one way fare can be purchased with $10 cash or four adult ETS tickets. The $10 cash option allows passengers to travel from the airport to Century Park and then transfer to another ETS bus or LRT service without paying an additional fee. Customers with a valid ETS transfer or an ETS bus pass will pay $7.50 or three ETS adult tickets. This is the first fare adjustment for Route 747 since the service was introduced in 2012, and it brings Edmonton’s airport fares in line with other municipalities offering public transit service to airports. ETS will be informing and reminding customers of these fare adjustments with various communication tactics throughout the month of January.

The petition's creator, 17(1) has stated his intent to speak to Councillor Ben Henderson about bringing the petition to City Council. In May 2008, Administration presented a report to Council regarding the regulation of single-use plastic bags in other jurisdictions. At the time the report was presented only two small Canadian municipalities (Leaf Rapids, Manitoba and Huntingdon, Quebec) used bylaws to regulate the use of plastic shopping bags. Plastic bags account for a relatively low volume of Edmonton's recycling stream. Film plastic, which includes bags, accounts for approximately 0.6% of the volume of recyclable materials processed by the Materials Recovery Facility and for approximately 2% of garbage collected from curbsides and multi-unit garbage bins. Currently, the City of Edmonton accepts plastic bags for recycling through its residential collection programs. Residents are encouraged to place plastic bags into their blue bag or bin or take them to a Recycling Depot. Over 90% of residents participate in recycling at home and programs are in place to educate residents on finding alternatives to single-use plastic bags and how to recycle them after use.

The Edmonton Valley Zoo has traditionally featured prominently on that list. For 2017, the Edmonton Valley Zoo has been given a “Dishonorable Mention - Repeat Offender.” Local media outlets often report on this release. City of Edmonton Position: Lucy has been cared for by responsible and dedicated zoo staff for more than 40 years, and the zoo is committed to providing Lucy with the best care she would receive anywhere. Key Messages: ● We take great exception to the continued misinformation about the care Lucy receives in Edmonton. She receives excellent care at the Edmonton Valley Zoo. ● Lucy is a content and well-adjusted elephant with some manageable health issues. Lucy’s most significant health challenge is a respiratory problem that makes it difficult for her to breathe when she is in a stressful situation, such as being transported or placed with unfamiliar caregivers. ● Third party specialists have stated that moving Lucy in her current condition would very likely kill her. The Edmonton Valley Zoo is in the business of caring for animals and putting their best interests ahead of all else. ● While the Edmonton Valley Zoo’s long-term goal is not to house elephants, the City of Edmonton will continue to make decisions in the best interest of Lucy – an individual animal with individual needs. Approach: Communications will issue a news release in response to the In Defense of Animals release. Administration will respond to any media inquiries. Background: ● The Edmonton Valley Zoo’s veterinarian and independent elephant specialists agree that the best place for Lucy is in Edmonton where she is comfortable, calm and well cared for. ● Lucy is imprinted on people, meaning she gets her emotional support from people, not other animals. Lucy bonds with her zoo family, the people who interact with her every day. Lucy has been given the opportunity to be with other elephants, in Edmonton and in Calgary, and all these experience show she does not understand how to interact with other elephants and does not do well within the social dynamics. The Edmonton Valley Zoo has consulted widely about Lucy’s health situation and her care. The Edmonton Valley Zoo’s decision to retain Dr. Jim Oosterhuis and other elephant experts is based on their experience in caring for elephants living in captivity. ● In 2016, Canada’s Associated Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) brought in Dr. Jonathan Cracknell from the United Kingdom to examine Lucy. Dr. Cracknell was brought in to do an independent welfare assessment of Lucy as part of the CAZA accreditation process, as the Edmonton Valley Zoo has been granted a variance from the CAZA standards that enables us to maintain a lone Asian elephant due to considerations around Lucy’s health. His findings, available on the City’s website , supported the other expert views. ● The Edmonton Valley Zoo is inspected annually by the Government of Alberta, which is fully aware of the situation with respect to Lucy including the controversy generated by the activist community. The Zoo permit for 2017-2018 was received in April 2017.

Since the Downtown Bike Network was approved for implementation in 2016, a number of additional projects and initiatives have been completed to examine how best to connect the Funicular to the Downtown Bike Network. Through the initial planning work completed in association with the selection of 100 Street as the preferred location of the Funicular, a future opportunity was identified for a pedestrian bridge over McDougall Hill that would provide a connection between the Funicular and the Heritage Trail on MacDonald Drive. However, as this future work was not part of the proposed work associated with the Funicular it was not advanced in the engineering design process. It remains a future consideration and additional planning work and funding would be required to carry this forward. Following approval of the Downtown Bike Network, preliminary analysis was completed to review the potential for an at grade pedestrian crossing of 100 Street to provide a connection to MacDonald Drive. Through this analysis, it was determined that this would require a signalized pedestrian crossing. Implementation of a signalized crossing at this location is not an ideal operational solution. Introducing a pedestrian actuated signal at the top of the hill is problematic for many reasons; a signal at this location would be in close proximity to the Jasper Avenue signalized intersection, which currently experiences congestion during peak hours, and would result in poor sightlines for northbound motor vehicles traveling up the hill. Furthermore, it would be located within the transition zone of the reversible lane operations on McDougall Hill which introduces additional operational and safety issues to an existing complex location that already sees conflicts. In addition, since approval of the Downtown Bike Network, the Jasper Avenue New Vision project has been initiated by Integrated Infrastructure Services. Integrated Infrastructure Services is currently leading concept planning and preliminary design work for Phase 2 of the Jasper Avenue New Vision project. This work involves concept planning for improvements to the pedestrian experience through widening of sidewalks on Jasper Avenue between 92 Street and 109 Street. The project also includes design of the second stage of work between 96 Street and 100 Street, with construction potentially being approved in the 2019-2022 capital program. This second phase provides an opportunity to coordinate planning for a connection between the Funicular and the 99 Street portion of the Downtown Bike Network. The Jasper Avenue New Vision project is exploring options to provide a connection between the Funicular and the 99 Street portion of the Downtown Bike Network. Initial analysis on this connection has identified that the sidewalk on the east side of 100 Street can be widened to support both cycling and pedestrian activity between the Funicular landing and Jasper Avenue. Along Jasper Avenue, a bicycle path can be incorporated into the southside of the avenue to facilitate a cycling connection to the future 99 Street portion of the Downtown Bike Network. Extension of the Downtown Bike Network along 99 Street is scheduled to be implemented in conjunction with Jasper Avenue New Vision and the Valley Line Southeast construction. The Jasper Avenue New Vision Project will be hosting an open house session to share this option with the public on January 18, 2018, from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm and from 4:30 pm to 8:00 pm at the CKUA Building located at 9804 Jasper Avenue NW.

A November 29, 2017 memo from the sub-committee to Council identified areas of concern relevant to a service package for Downtown District Energy within the Supplementary Budget scheduled for Council December 5, 2017. The sub-committee has since met with Administration and ENMAX and provides this updated memo. The sub-committee recognizes that outstanding concerns will be answered in the next phase of evaluation via a revised scope of work detailed below. To that end, the subcommittee offers its support for this proposal. The specifics of this revised scope as well as any relevant clarifications are italicized next to the original memo content below: 1. Explore the costs and benefits of deep energy retrofits combined with an evaluation of the costs and benefits of on-site combined cooling, heat and power systems, for the buildings identified in the proposed Phase 1 of the Downtown District Energy system (assess both City-owned and privately owned buildings). The City of Edmonton is engaging an external consultant to complete energy audits on up to four of the City owned buildings within Phase I of the proposed build area. These audits will identify the potential for energy reduction at the building level and ensure ENMAX’s study will include the reduced loads in the overall business case. It is important to note that Administration will include an evaluation of Combined Cooling Heat and Power (CCHP also known as tri-generation) within the scope of the audits to address the original concern that target buildings are cooling dominant in their energy demand. 2. A clear assessment and confirmation that the mechanism employed to account for the carbon reductions associated with the District Energy system will accrue to the City of Edmonton at the building level for those buildings that they own. Carbon Reduction ownership will be fully examined as part of any future negotiations of a Commercial Agreement. It is the subcommittee’s recommendation that the City buildings connected would own the environmental benefits generated. Additional owners of connected buildings should also have this option. 3. An evaluation of rate structures for the District Energy system to confirm they will account for (and allow) any future energy savings initiatives that are undertaken at the building level in the franchise area, without financial penalty. The rate structure will be fully examined as part of any future negotiations of a Commercial Agreement. In particular all impacts of reduced load as connected buildings undergo retrofits and likely require less energy over time, must be included. The Sub Committee will be unable to support a rate structure that penalizes retrofits. An understanding of which party is responsible for finding customer(s) for excess capacity resulting from retrofits will also be important. 4. A complete and transparent evaluation of the franchise agreement for the downtown District Energy system to confirm it will not restrict or economically hinder any future community energy systems that may be introduced or pursued by other market actors (for any shared heating or cooling within a group of buildings as well as at the individual building level). A Franchise Agreement will be fully examined as part of any future negotiations of a Commercial Agreement. This will include the specific benefit(s) a franchise agreement would bring to the City. This negotiation should address variations of property ownership and energy transport across roadways, property lines and other physical distribution methods. It is important that property owners in the franchise area have flexibility and are not restricted in their energy choices. 5. That the Downtown District Energy system agreements and design be revised to incorporate findings of the above elements as applicable. The results of these findings will be shared with ETAC with appropriate lead time to evaluate the revised proposal with the new and updated information. The subcommittee acknowledges that ENMAX is already incorporating lessons learned from the Calgary system, in particular, obtaining formal commitments from customers of the system in advance of construction and incorporating requirements f","or the future addition of any Co/ Tri-generation installations in the design. 6. That an independent review of the findings be prepared for City of Edmonton as part of the final evaluation process. An independent 3rd party review will be undertaken to confirm the capacity calculations of the proposed system and the connected buildings, including the impact of energy retrofits. In addition, ENMAX will engage an independent third party reviewer with extensive expertise in district energy design, and implementation. The ETAC Downtown District Energy Sub-Committee is committed to providing advice to City Council and Administration on this aspect of Greenhouse Gas reduction initiatives within Edmonton’s Community Energy Transition Strategy and appreciates Council’s efforts. We make ourselves available for review of emerging results to support the City of Edmonton.

A competitive process was held for the vehicle purchase phase of this project, and a Fairness Monitor was retained to provide independent third-party oversight. The City also placed additional measures in the Negotiated Request for Proposals (NRFP) to ensure transparency, accountability and value for the money, including a: ● “No lobbying” clause to ensure the highest standard for ethical behaviour in the procurement process; and ● Requirement that all information requests be directed to one contact person in Corporate Procurement & Supply Services (CPSS) to ensure everyone had access to the same information. These measures ensured the 10-member Evaluation Committee could consider the proposals based on their technical and financial merit. The Fairness Report will be available online once all contracts have been signed. The preferred proponent has been selected, and CPSS, Law and the Business Unit are beginning negotiations. At this time, both the preferred and other proponents are being notified of their status in the procurement. Right now we are entering into negotiations and contract details would be finalized at the next stage if and when we reach agreement. The contract will not be finalized until we have agreement from each side. It is important to note that no award has been given and all proponents will be notified of any award decisions in the future.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton by Sustainable Development in 2013 as part of the Strathcona, Queen Alexandra, and Garneau Historic Resources Inventory Project. Originally constructed in 1910, the William Netzel Residence is significant for its association with the theme of residential development in Queen Alexandra. This residence was constructed during the amalgamation period of the City of Strathcona with the City of Edmonton, which started in 1910 and was finalized in 1912. This was an economic boom period for the area and this two storey building is indicative of the pre-World War I boom experienced at that time. The design reflects modest Queen Anne Style influences. William Netzel, a labourer, was listed as the first resident in 1914. The owner/applicant has been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The owner has informed Administration that they do not wish to designate the property. The owner has provided and met the Special Information Requirements to document Historic Resources on the Inventory, as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. This property is currently zoned (RA7) Low Rise Apartment Zone and the owner/applicant proposes rezoning this property plus four adjacent properties to a (DC2) Site Specific Development Control Provision. This DC2 provision would facilitate the development of Apartment Housing with a maximum height of 17.5 metres (five storeys) and up to 50 dwellings. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires in that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value. For your information, this represents the first demolition of a property on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. A total of eight properties on the Inventory of Historic Resources were demolished in 2017. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Branch Manager, Development Services Linda Sahil, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

Here is background information for your use in responding. Chronology The snowfall between Thursday and Friday night was between 10 and 30 centimetres in different areas of the city -- more than the City received through the entire rest of the winter. When snow was in the forecast, more than 200 people and 118 pieces of equipment were mobilized Thursday night. Before the snow fell, crews with trucks sanded bridge decks and on- and off-ramps, and filled community sandboxes. When the snow began falling late Thursday, crews in city plow trucks cleared major roads, and hand crews cleared stairs and bus stops. Snowfall continued through the day Friday. Additional contractors with full-sized graders were called in on Friday at midnight. By Friday afternoon, a parking ban had been declared to take effect Saturday at 11:59 p.m.. Through the weekend, crews continued to plow more than 2,100 kilometres of major arterial roads, collector roads, and bus routes, and remove the snow. Over five nights, crews moved more than 85,000 tonnes of snow. 1,318 tickets were given out at $100 each and $120 towing. The parking ban was lifted Monday at 11:59 p.m., and neighborhood blading began thereafter. Concerns Some residents expressed concern that their routes were not bare, or had not been recently cleared for their Friday travel. Given that snow continued to fall from Thursday night onward, many of the roads which had been cleared early in the cycle were again snowy several hours later. Others expressed concern that bike lanes had been cleared while roads had not. Generally, the protected bike routes are priority lanes for cyclists and are cleared with the same priority as arterial roads for cars. Protected bike routes also require different equipment to clear so they are not taking away from vehicle road clearing. Because many protected bike lanes are next to roads which are not arterials, the difference in timing is visible to drivers. Others have expressed concern about a parking ban being implemented without adequate notification. I can assure you that there were significant general communications activities: a media announcement generating coverage across all major stations, a banner on all City of Edmonton web pages, posts on social media, a message on roadside signs, and a scrolled message across the fronts of all ETS buses. Specifically, all routes that are part of the parking ban do not allow curb parking or are marked with “Seasonal Parking Ban” signs. Others expressed concern that neighborhood blading was happening overnight. While there is some community disruption and noise associated with blading activities, we aim to minimize any disruption while the 24/7 approach to clearing ensures that roads are cleared as quickly as possible. We are striving for the right balance between safety, fiscal responsibility, minimizing environmental impact, and mobility. That means we make decisions about when to call in contracted graders, how to prioritize different roads, and when to use sand, road salt, calcium chloride solution, or any combination as needed to address snow and ice control under a variety of environmental conditions. Edmonton is a winter city, and snow is part of our travelling reality. We have a robust program in place to keep residents on the move. We also recognize that safe winter travel requires drivers to adjust to ever-changing conditions, for property owners to maintain sidewalks and walkways, and for all travellers to be cautious.

The following information describes the process and information that was communicated: • Through our road alert notification system, an email message was sent on February 3 to 14,000 subscribers advising them that a parking ban was coming into effect that night. • More than 60 freeway and roadside digital signs were updated to reflect that the parking ban was in place, and they continued the display for the duration of the ban. • All Edmonton Transit Service buses put ""seasonal parking ban declared"" messaging on the front digital displays of their buses for the duration of the ban. On February 3 and 4, an average of 350 buses were on the road each day. • A bright yellow banner was activated to appear on every page of the City's website. • The City's Twitter and Facebook accounts were updated on February 3 and 4, and the Facebook posts alone were seen by over 40,000 people. We also depend on the support of our local media. Over the course of the weekend, a news release was issued, and a media availability was held. CTV, CBC, Global, CityTV, Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun all provided information to the public about the ban. Our messaging through all of these communication channels clearly indicated that when the ban is in effect, vehicles parked in locations with ""Seasonal Parking Ban"" signs are subject to tagging and towing. Of course, many Edmontonians may simply have noticed the amount of snowfall, expected a seasonal parking ban to come into effect, and then taken an interest to learn if they should move their vehicle. We also received a specific complaint from a citizen in regards to the email notification process. Specifically, the citizen indicated that they did not receive an email notification about the ban, and asked if they had been deleted from the system. The database for the email notification system indicates that citizen received and opened the notification email. There was no indication that the citizen's email address had been deleted from the system as indicated. Should citizens choose to sign up for our road alert notification, we encourage them to add our email (roadalerts@edmonton.ca) to their address book, contacts or safe sender list to help ensure they receive our emails to their inbox instead of their spam folder.

Edmonton was the lone Alberta community to host at least one leg of the Tour each year.

However, the Board has decided its best course of action is to cease operations effective immediately.

The Downtown Bike Network launched in late June 2017, providing 7.8-km of protected bike lanes and shared-use paths to Edmonton’s downtown. Prior to opening, the City of Edmonton partnered with the University of Alberta to develop a performance monitoring framework for the new protected bike lanes. The following tasks are currently under evaluation as part of the work through the University of Alberta: ● Measure the connectivity of the current bicycle network and the proposed bicycle network ● Develop an overall evaluation framework for the purpose of monitoring the Downtown Bike Network performance over time ● Monitor performance before and after installation of the Downtown Bike Network. This includes user experiences and cyclist-related accidents ● Understand the change in demographics including age and gender of cyclists before and after the installation of the Downtown Bike Network Bicycle, pedestrian and vehicle traffic counts are also being monitored with single day counts at 13 locations along the Downtown Bike Network. These counts take place approximately every two weeks to retrieve examples from weekdays, weekends, holidays and event days. New counters will be installed in spring 2018 which will enable daily counts at the 13 locations across the Downtown Bike Network. The University of Alberta’s metrics evaluation will be complete at the end of Q4 2018. All current and available data is updated on the Downtown Bike Network project page , which includes a link to the interactive Downtown Bike Network Monitoring dashboard .

We are currently in Phase 1 of the Centre Line project, which is focused on corridor selection . Once we have a Council-approved corridor, the project will transition into concept design , which will include decisions relating to how the LRT will fit within the corridor (including station locations and river crossing options). Alongside the Centre Line LRT project, Administration commissioned Stantec to explore the technical feasibility of modifying the High Level Bridge for additional structural loading including potentially LRT and active transportation use. The executive summary of that report is available online and is also attached. The report’s findings included that the City’s current maintenance schedule and previous rehabilitation efforts have ensured the High Level Bridge is safe for its current function and use. However, the risk associated with a 100+ year-old bridge combined with the addition of LRT loads is not recommended at this time. This is attributed primarily to the age of the bridge and the extensive strengthening that would be required to support LRT. LRT bridge structures are typically designed for a service life of 100 years. As outlined in the executive summary provided, this is not something likely achievable on a 100 year-old bridge given modern design requirements and codes. Administration is preparing to bring forward a report as part of a non-statutory public hearing tentatively scheduled for April 2018 related to the Centre LRT project corridor selection.

Further reports are being coordinated for October, which will more fully outline the framework and future activities needed to ensure alignment of regional and local economic development efforts. Edmonton Global City Council received an information report related to the creation of Edmonton Global, the new regional economic entity, which reflected the need to ensure alignment and collaboration with this new organization. Since then, Edmonton Global has taken a number of key steps to advance the organization, including appointing a Board of Directors and undertaking a sectoral review as part of its strategy development process. It also has commenced a contract with EEDC to deliver interim foreign direct investment (FDI) attraction services on behalf of the regional organization for the duration of 2018, until the needed structure and staffing component is fully operational. The organization has recently hired a CEO (Malcolm Bruce) and is undertaking a strategy development process, which includes its brand development work and exploration of possible enhancements to the organization's mandate. Edmonton Global is working through these elements and indicates it expects to be fully operational by July 1, 2018, with a Board-endorsed strategy established that will drive its business. City Administration and EEDC have undertaken discussions since the creation of Edmonton Global to consider, together, how to best support Edmonton Global and ensure Edmonton's economic development interests are met over the long term. The transfer and continued activation of the Major Attraction Strategy Program from EEDC to Edmonton Global was achieved. The full allocation of the combined $3 million provincial/federal contribution for the program over two years (2017-18) has been secured, with a partnered contribution of $860,000 in one-time funding by Edmonton Global, EEDC and the City. The supporting $300,000 from the City was through the City's Economic Development program. EEDC With the creation of Edmonton Global and some recent decisions of Council, EEDC's role for economic development is evolving. The work to bring together the Shaw Conference Centre and EXPO Centre continues, and, more broadly, Administrations of the City and EEDC are working to prepare draft materials to articulate at a high level the roles for local economic development that each party may assume. The City will continue to work with EEDC on its review of its business as it goes forward. Brand and Reputation A key component of the overall alignment work between the City and EEDC is to establish brand and reputation role clarity. This alignment work will further include consideration of Edmonton Global's mandate to establish a regional brand. At the July 4, 2017 Executive Committee meeting, a motion was passed asking Administration to provide a report by early 2018 on this topic. Administration has requested delaying that report until fall of this year, to align with RED's October 2018 report on the transition to a greater regional approach to economic development. By that time, we expect that important decisions regarding mandates, operational linkages, resourcing, and role clarity will be advanced and ready to be shared. In the interim, we are providing an update on the work underway and some of the achievements to date. The City of Edmonton overall brand and reputation can be attributed to three complementary brand building blocks - place brand, economic development brand, and corporate brand. Each of these interrelated pieces are used to construct a cohesive brand and reputation. Each of these brand building blocks possess unique audiences that benefit from receiving customized, yet harmonized messaging. We are actively working on a suite of brand-related items that highlight the products, services and people that make Edmonton an exciting and dynamic city and organization. We are leveraging existing visual brand assets in public facing communications and initiatives and aligning marketing under the overarching City of Edmonton visual identity. Edmonton's Place Brand: Further articulated via Vision 2050 and championed by City Council, place brand refers to Edmonton's international attractiveness as a place-of-choice for visitors, investors, students and residents. The City of Edmonton supports the place brand work primarily through Vi","sion 2050. In the meantime, and in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, the Marketing Branch continues advancing Edmonton's reputation through hosting major conferences and events (such as CitiesIPCC and Climate Change Science Conference, Red Bull Crashed Ice, etc.,) and supports economic development initiatives. The place brand efforts continue to give spotlight to our city. For the third year in a row, Edmonton made the top ten of Around the Rings' World's Top Sports Cities, the only Canadian city alongside cities like London and Tokyo. In addition to ongoing promotional efforts, Administration is also undertaking a significant public engagement (Vision 2050) to support the renewal of Council's vision for Edmonton in 2050. This important work will guide Administration's city building efforts to reflect Edmontonians' aspiration for our city. This will also lead the brand building work to enhance Edmonton's global competitiveness. Economic Development Brand Work: Communications and Engagement is aligning brand development efforts with Regional and Economic Development's work in collaboration with Edmonton Global and EEDC. Both the City of Edmonton corporate brand and Edmonton's place brand will align to the regional brand work that will be undertaken by Edmonton Global. Corporate Brand Strategy: This refers to how Edmontonians perceive the City as an organization. The Marketing Branch in the Communications and Engagement department is responsible for the corporate brand strategy and execution. Launched in early 2018, the corporate brand strategy is focused on internally promoting the breadth of our product service offering and our cultural commitments. This strategy will build throughout 2018 and will be based on research used to identify gaps between present and desired perceptions of our City's best attributes and potential challenges. A Request for Quotes is currently underway to select a brand marketing firm to conduct this research and further develop brand positioning statements by Q4 2018. While concurrently establishing brand research baselines, we have rolled out a staff story video series to City employees. This internal brand work is closely aligned with the corporate culture commitments rollout strategy. A strong and positive internal corporate culture is one of the our most powerful tools in best serving Edmontonians. Positive interactions with residents has a direct perception of us as an organization. Changing the Way We Communicate: The City has a growing opportunity to expand its public communications efforts and there is an increasing need to develop and fill new channels of information to keep the public informed of City services, programs and initiatives. A new means of communicating directly with Edmonton media and residents is being explored. Presently referred to as ""Channel 11"" (working title), the project is being developed in response to radical changes in the conventional media landscape, where fewer reporters have less time to construct their stories. The City of Edmonton, because of its commitment to openness and transparency, continues to be a source of those stories. It is increasingly in the City's interest to investigate ways to share the message and insight and stories of City of Edmonton work directly with the public, in channels favoured by the public, and not rely solely on those messages being mediated by traditional sources. ""Channel 11"" envisions the City of Edmonton working in the media-making space by writing, photographing, broadcasting, podcasting, creating gifs and infographics exclusively for City media channels, existing and planned, in a voice that is authentic and in a manner that invites sharing and interaction. This will be a primary methodology for ""Telling Our Stories,"" sharing our brand both locally and globally, and building our reputation as a great place to live, visit, grow a business and invest. Through its transformation work in 2017, the Communications branch was able to establish new leadership to drive expanded approaches to public communications beyond reliance on traditional media. Adding new channels and storytelling tools will allow for even more expansion of these efforts. We are approaching our collective work with a vigorous, collaborative and engaging process.

Spring Street Sweeping The City of Edmonton conducts street sweeping as needed and as conditions allow. If there is no snow in the forecast and road temperatures are above zero degrees Celsius, conditions are acceptable for street sweeping. When possible for the past couple of weeks, Parks and Roads Services has been getting a start on sweeping. Scheduled street sweeping on major roadways began on Monday, April 23 with a target completion of June 1 despite the late start due to weather. This past season we also used over 60% less sand which will reduce the time required to sweep city streets. During annual street sweeping, crews remove sand, garbage and debris from road surfaces and boulevards. This annual program improves the appearance and safety of our streets. Over the course of sweeping, there will be periodic lane reductions and closures on major arterials including Yellowhead Trail, Whitemud Drive, Gateway Boulevard, and on routes through the river valley. Barricades and city vehicles will be in place, and staff will be clearing sand and trash from medians and curbs. In higher-risk locations, law enforcement will be in place near where crews are working to help remind drivers to slow down and give our equipment space. The public is being informed of these road closures via roadside message boards and social media. Further communication about street sweeping is being conducted via neighbourhood signs, social media, website, and a public service announcement. A street sweeping schedule and progress map is posted online at edmonton.ca/streetcleaning. The City has measures in place to minimize dust, but street sweepers can still create dusty conditions that reduce visibility. If drivers see dust, they should slow down and drive for conditions. Street sweepers can create dusty conditions, severely reducing visibility. Motorists are asked to give City equipment plenty of space -- in front, behind and on both sides. They should proceed with extreme caution when workers are present in order to ensure the safety of both crews and drivers. Potholes As temperatures warm, increasing numbers of potholes are appearing on city streets. Pothole filling happens year-round, but activity ramps up in the early spring when an increase in freeze-thaw cycles leads to ground expansion and contraction. Given the number of freeze-thaw cycles we experienced this winter, we expect to see a considerable number of potholes on City roads this spring. However, in January and February we saw a decrease in both complaints about potholes and actual potholes filled compared to the same last year. In an average year, City crews fill nearly half a million potholes. If citizens see potholes, they can bring it to the City’s attention in one of three ways: ● Call 311; ● Use the 311 app; ● Visit edmonton.ca/potholes and report it online. City crews also conduct their own inspections to find potholes. Crews prioritize repairs based on several factors, including pothole severity, location and traffic volume. Potholes are a product of Alberta weather, Edmonton’s ground soil and aging infrastructure. The City of Edmonton is committed to investing in our roads, and we can expect to see continual improvement in the condition of our roads. Citizens will be informed of City efforts to fill potholes and what they can do to report potholes via traditional and social media, 311, a public service announcement and on the edmonton.ca website. They will also have an opportunity to share their feedback in an Insight survey in September. More information on potholes can be found at edmonton.ca/potholes .

With the program in full implementation mode, the role of the Blatchford Redevelopment Advisory Group (BRAG) will be replaced by a home builder group as they become partners with the City on this initiative. The Blatchford Redevelopment Advisory Group (BRAG) was created in June 2014, following discussions at City Council during the review of the Blatchford Business Case report. Due to the significant scope and scale of the program it was considered a prudent risk mitigation measure to involve an expert panel to advise the Blatchford Team as the project transitioned from a planning exercise to implementation. The members of BRAG were recruited in September 2014, with executive sponsorship from the General Manager, Sustainable Development. The previously established Steering Committee gave way to BRAG for the next step in the process - concept refinement and the preparation of the detailed business case and phased implementation strategy. These steps have now been completed and City Council has approved the district energy sharing system that is required to achieve the energy objectives set for the project. With the Blatchford Redevelopment program in full implementation mode, annual design and construction activities are forecasted for the next 20 years. Going forward, the build-out schedule and marketing activities will be reviewed annually by Administration to make the adjustments to the product mix (by unit type) and size of stage (number of units). City Council has reviewed and confirmed strategic direction with respect to district energy, affordable housing and northwest LRT extension as elements that influence the program. The first phase of the builder selection process has been completed and there is very strong interest from builders for all housing types. The selection of specific builders for each development site will be the next step in the process of creating a builder group for Blatchford. The builders will become the key stakeholder group in the implementation process and will be expected to be primary contributors to the Blatchford team on housing supply and demand decisions, and identifying home buyer preferences. The City very much values the input provided by BRAG over the past three years and would like to acknowledge the many contributions made by the members of the Advisory Group to assist in the successful launch of this city-building initiative.

None of that will change. Safety and security of all Edmontonians will remain the number one priority during the transition and ongoing. The new reporting structure will be fully in place by July 2018. During this transition, transferring employees will remain in their current work locations and their responsibilities will not change. Longer term, we believe there is significant potential to streamline processes and provide more consistent training and development. With this change, some of our key stakeholders like the Edmonton Police Service have one point of contact in regular daily interactions or an emerging situation. Communication is planned today with all Peace Officers, employees in the Professional Standards Unit and the support staff members who will transfer. Conversations with transit operators will also occur to ensure they understand that this change in no way affects the strong working relationship that Peace Officers have with transit operators in maintaining safety and security of transit facilities.

As a result, we recently received notice that two builders’ liens were registered against title of the Blatchford lands. On December 1, 2017, Norwood Waterworks and EMCO Corporation registered liens. We have also been advised by the general contractor that two other builders’ lien are in the process of being registered, Lafarge Canada Inc. and Canwest Concrete Cutting & Coring Inc.. A builders’ lien is a charge against a parcel of land. It is designed by legislation to provide contractors/subcontractors, who supplied labour or materials to improve that land, with a form of security. It secures amounts that have not been fully paid for the work supplied. Builders’ liens in construction projects are not uncommon. The contract with our general contractor contains a number of provisions that are designed to protect the City’s interests in the event that a lien is filed. As contemplated in our contract, the City maintains a builders’ lien holdback to limit the City’s exposure to claims such as this. Further, payments to the general contractor have been suspended until the liens are removed. Presently, these issues are being investigated and work towards having these liens removed is underway.

It alleges excessive force and racial profiling of a self-identified minority ethnic youth at Belvedere LRT station on January 19, 2018. The media says Edmonton Police Service (EPS) confirmed they opened an investigation into the incident on February 21, 2018. City of Edmonton Position: The City is committed to the highest standards for its Transit Peace Officers and thoroughly investigates all formal customer complaints. The City can confirm that the ETS Professional Standards Unit received a formal customer complaint and is following up per standard protocols . ETS will cooperate with EPS, as requested.

Much of the system is operating on original infrastructure which has been maintained and upgraded as required over the years. However, the time has come for a major retrofit to ensure that the system continues to operate safely and reliably while also maximising the system’s lifespan. Over 75 projects are planned for the LRT system in 2018 alone, which includes 24 major infrastructure projects and numerous maintenance projects. To minimize customer disruption, much of this required work has been scheduled during transit’s slower season in late spring/summer, during non-peak hours and during typical non-service hours from approximately 2:00 am to 5:00 am. However, to ensure safety as well as to meet the deadlines necessary to secure provincial and federal Public Transit Infrastructure Funding (PTIF), some customer-impacting service adjustments are required. The planned work includes some partial short-term shutdowns, similar to work we’ve done in the past on the northeast portion of the Capital Line, and two longer-term station closures. Details are in the attached 2018 LRT Shutdown Framework Schedule Overview and 2018 LRT Shutdown Framework Schedule. While the projects are diverse and complex, the short term pains will be worth the long term gains. The expectation is that the completed projects will contribute to an enhanced customer experience and reduction of some operational costs. Transit customers are being informed of the adjustments well in advance through a variety of communication efforts, including station posters, web, social media, 311, and paid advertisements. As additional details are confirmed, ETS will update City Council accordingly.

This Policy update, timed with Council’s approval of its 24 initiatives for the 2017-2021 term, has provided Administration an opportunity to enhance its approach to helping Council achieve its desired outcomes. This approach puts in place further structures and processes to ensure Administration is aligned and integrated as well as focusing on better understanding the resource implications of individual initiatives and their aggregate impact. The new process is summarized below: Step 1: Terms of Reference Administration has been working with Council Sponsors to draft a high-level Terms of Reference for each Council Initiative, which include: ● Sponsor Role(s) ● Mandate ● Desired Outcomes and Objectives ● Key Stakeholders ● Existing Related Corporate Programs ● Financial Implications (outlining financial and human resources associated with existing initiatives). Draft Terms of Reference documents will be presented for approval on March 20, 2018. Administration will provide a brief presentation on the process and will prepare a slide for each initiative. Administration will ask for this item to be time specific, as it is anticipated each Council Sponsor will want to speak to their initiative(s). Branch Manager leads will also be in attendance to answer questions. Step 2: Work Plans Guided by Council Sponsors, Administration will prepare a detailed work plan for each Initiative that will be presented for Council approval on June 12, 2018. Plans will identify: ● Specific actions and associated timelines that will be taken by Administration to fulfill the goals and objectives of each Council Initiative ● Resource requirements (human, financial, and other) needed to achieve planned actions Administration will be working with Council Sponsor offices to set up meetings for work plan development. Step 3: Implementation and Reporting Once the work plans are approved by Council, Administration will being implementation. Using a corporate template, Administration will prepare semi-annual initiative status reports (including work plan updates) to the appropriate Council Standing Committees. This will differ in 2021, during which a final summary report will be provided to Council prior to the election. Next Steps Administration is in the process of developing a presentation to support Council’s discussion about the draft Terms of Reference documents on March 20, 2018. To support the Sponsor(s) presentation of the Terms of Reference to Council during this item, Administration is preparing a draft presentation slide along with speaking notes for each initiative.

The Mechanized River Valley Access (MRVA) is comprised of the 100 Street Funicular (inclined passenger car), the stairway leading from 100 Street to Grierson Road, the walkway and bridge over Grierson Road including the Frederick G. Todd Lookout, and the elevator near the river which takes passengers down one level to the river valley trails. The funicular opened on December 9, 2017, and since then it has been in service from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily with the exception of Christmas Day when it opened from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is a total of three months in service, or over 1200 hours. The funicular has been out of service for approximately 100 hours of which 50 percent was planned outages. The primary reasons for downtime include: ● Monthly maintenance (planned outage) : Every month, the funicular shuts down for one day (8-14 hours) to ensure proper operation, reliability, and safety. This is an ongoing maintenance requirement for the system. ● System adjustments (planned outage) : These are expected and reasonable for any new system entering operation. Systems adjustments includes addressing items such as door timing, reviewing various system alarms, and working with the manufacturer to resolve system issues. ● Adverse weather conditions : At around -25 degrees Celsius, the platform doors become sluggish and can trigger an alarm that needs resetting. In addition, snow and ice has occasionally collected in the door paths causing the doors to not open or close, triggering an alarm. When in 'alarm' mode, the funicular does not operate. ● User Interaction : There have been occasions where the funicular shut down intermittently due to pressing of the emergency stop button without any apparent issues within the elevator cab. To date there has not been an incident of an actual emergency situation requiring EMS call out. The City is working with the contractor to have protective covers installed to reduce the accidental use of the button. The elevator near the river has been in service since February 16, 2018, to allow the completion of the final service adjustments required by Alberta Elevating Devices, Amusement Rides Safety Association (AEDARSA). Since February 16, 2018, there have been three incidents where the behaviour of users in the car have triggered the alarms and shut it down. The elevator is currently in operation and we are continuing to monitor alarm situations. To ensure smooth operation during this weekend’s Red Bull Crashed Ice Event, Administration has taken a proactive role in employing additional site personnel, including elevator technicians, during event times. The funicular will have extended hours until 11 p.m. both Friday and Saturday to support. Furthermore, Administration is reviewing staffing strategies during the first year of warranty to provide: 1. Additional analysis / data on how well the infrastructure performs; 2. Diary / journal of site statistics (general use / amount and type of traffic); 3. Logging of incidents when they occur and what site conditions were; 4.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton by Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development in 2013 as part of the Strathcona, Queen Alexandra and Garneau Historic Resources Inventory project. Originally constructed in 1914, the Louise Watts Residence has an intersecting gable roof and clapboard signing with corner boards. There is an inset, three-sided open porch with two entrances and one window. A single pier supports the open inset porch at the corner of the front façade. The modest design of the two-storey residence incorporates Craftsman Style influences, and the design gives the residence prominence within the community. The two-storey massing of the building reflects the aesthetic preferences of residents in Garneau for larger, two-storey homes before the First World War. The intersecting gable roof is an unusual style element for the Garneau Neighbourhood, as is the inset porch in what is otherwise a square plan, creating a very small space on the second storey above the door. Victorian design influences on this modest two-storey house include the intersecting gable roof, the art glass in the upper sashes of many of the windows, the pediments incorporated into the gable ends of the side façades, the decorative shingles in and beneath the pediments on the side façades, and the use of clapboard cladding with corner boards. The residence was vacant for a year after its construction, and the first occupant was Albert A. Hill in 1915, a brakeman for the Canadian National Rai lroad. Dr. Malcolm E. Mackay, a surgeon working in the McLeod Building, occupied the residence from 1916 until 1917. Philip Mullen, a real estate agent, became the next tenant in 1919. The house was not occupied by the same tenant for more than two years until 1925, when Mrs. Louise Watts moved in. Mrs. Watts resided here from 1925 until 1928, from 1944 until 1945, and from 1948 until 1954. The owner/applicant has been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The owner has informed the Heritage Management Unit that they do not wish to designate the property. The owner has provided and met the Special Information Requirements for historic resources on the Inventory as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. The residence is in poor condition, with foundation issues, leaks in the roof, severa l windows replaced, damage to exterior cladding, and significant poorly-done alterations to the interior. This property is currently zoned (RF6) Medium Density Mul tip le Family Zone. The owner has received a development permit to construct a new single detached dwelling with a secondary suite on the site. As a reminder to City Council, t he Historical Resources Act provides a municipality t he abi lity to designate a structure as a Municipa l Historic Resou rce without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that t he owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic va lue, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent. For your information, this represents the second demolition of a property on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Branch Manager, Development Services Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

At this event, TransEd personnel will provide an update on current project progress and expected work for 2018. As part of this update, TransEd will formally announce two significant items: 1) That the Valley Line Quarters-to-Louise McKinney tunnel excavation is expected to be complete in early April, with an anticipated breakthrough celebration on that day. 2) That the Shared Use Path component of the Tawatinâ Bridge will not be open by May 2019 as originally scheduled. In the process of building the foundations for the new Tawatinâ Bridge, TransEd crews working on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River encountered an obstacle in the river bed. Further investigation showed the obstacle to be a concrete mass. The location of the object complicates TransEd’s construction process. Administration is working to maintain a high degree of public transparency on this issue, including: ● TransEd and City Administration will meet in person with the River Valley Citizen Working Group on the day of the announcement to provide an update, hear concerns and solicit additional feedback. ● From March 17 - 28, TransEd will hold a series of open houses to share project designs and localized construction impacts for 2018 with various communities along the project alignment. Details on these events are available at TransEd’s website. A new opening date for the Shared Use Path has not yet been determined.

The IFOP stage is scheduled to begin this spring. In addition to advancing the builder selection process, the project team is preparing for another full year of construction activity at the site. Construction work scheduled for this year includes installing the geo-exchange field under the first stormwater pond and the construction of the first Energy Centre for the District Energy Sharing System. We will also complete installing utilities, paving roads and building sidewalks in the first stage and will begin landscaping work including planting boulevard trees, rain gardens and bioswales as well as building the first neighbourhood park.

On February 21, 2018, Boyle Street Community League was advised that the City would terminate the agreement to operate the Boyle Plaza within six months and at that time the YMCA would assume operations for three years. Operation of the facility will be reviewed at the end of the three years, with the potential for the community league to resume operation at that time. Over the past few years, a number of conversations with the Community League Board have occurred related to programming options and protocols for managing the facility. The City's action on management of the Boyle Plaza facility was motivated by the need to move toward the success and long-term sustainability of the community league and Boyle Plaza and to ensure that recreational programming continues to be available and accessible to the residents of the Boyle Street neighbourhood through the operation of Boyle Plaza over the long-term. The YMCA was chosen because their mandate is similar to that of the community league, as an organization that provides social and recreational opportunities for people in the neighbourhood and experience with facility management. They are also part owners of the Boyle Plaza and have an office located on site. Moving facility operations to a third party will enable the league to focus on growing its membership, connecting with the community, providing community social and recreational opportunities, enhancing board governance, increasing membership and planning for revenue growth. The City will support the league to grow their capacity in these areas. The City and the community league will be engaging in facilitated conversations to confirm how the league will continue to access office and program space at the facility, as well as to discuss goals and objectives for the league moving forward, key milestones, actions to build capacity and the ways the City can support.

The next steps involve a two phase public engagement process. Between April 12 to June 14, 2018, Edmontonians will be invited to one of 24 drop-in workshops around the city (See Appendix 1) to help refine the draft bus network. Alternatively, they can fill out an online survey. There will be additional engagement activities with key stakeholders (such as the Edmonton Transit System Advisory Board) and ETS staff. In the fall, Edmontonians will be invited to a second round of engagement to see how the City of Edmonton has integrated their initial feedback and share any last insights. Following the public engagement, in Q1 2019 ETS will bring forward to Council for consideration revisions to City Policy C539 Transit Service standards. ETS is committed to implementing a new bus network in 2020, while also ensuring the timing of the changes allows for optimal customer education opportunities and employee training. Ideally, changes to the southeast bus network will be timed to correspond as closely as possible to the opening of the Southeast Valley Line. Bearing this in mind, ETS plans to roll out the new bus routes for lune 2020. This date aligns with scheduled seasonal changes and also provides ample opportunity to launch a comprehensive customer education campaign about how service is changing. A service package will be brought forward as part of the 2019-2022 operating budget to provide precursor express bus service along the southeast Valley Line corridor until the Val ley Line opens. The Transit Strategy was built on input from thousands of Edmontonians and was approved by Council on July 11, 2017. The d,raft bus network redesign reflects citizens priorities by delivering bus service that meets the current needs of more Edmontonians. It includes what the City heard from citizens during the development of the Transit Strategy, including: • Edmontonians want a transit system that is safe, fast, convenient and reliable. • Citizens in the inner neighbourhoods, want more frequent service, service throughout the day and seven days a week. Citizens in the outer neighbourhoods want more direct service, shorter travel times, and place a greater emphasis on weekday peak service.

Evolving Infill is on track and continues to build on the momentum and conversations sparked by Edmonton’s Infill Roadmap in an effort to welcome more people and new homes into Edmonton’s older neighbourhoods. Evolving Infill has five stages: ● Stage 1 - Startup ● Stage 2 - Listening and Learning ● Stage 3 - Putting the Draft Actions Together ● Stage 4 - Public Review and Discussion ● Stage 5 - Implementation We are currently in Stage 4. During this stage we are spending time refining and iterating the potential actions that the City of Edmonton will undertake to enable more infill development. A robust public engagement process that started in the fall of 2016 has allowed us to maintain close connections throughout the project with our key stakeholders, like the building and development industry, interested community groups, citizens, and City colleagues. This process has resulted in the development of strong infill actions that we can publicly commit to undertaking as an Administration, and that have the support of our stakeholders. The third and final round of public engagement opportunities will take place in March 2018, allowing feedback on the draft Infill Roadmap of 2018. The first draft of the Infill Roadmap 2018 is attached here and is also available online on our website at coeinfill.ca . One final round of minor edits to the content of the Roadmap will be made by the project team in April with an aim to publish the final draft version online in May. The What We Heard report wi ll also be updated to reflect the results of public engagement from the second and third rounds this year. We will be presenting the results of this project to Urban Planning Committee in June. The Evolving Infi ll Project has been supported by strong, respectful, and col legial working relationships with both internal and external stakeholders. In particular, our internal colleagues, including those with EPCOR, have demonstrated accountability to this work using an integrated approach. A serious commitment to maintaining the integrity of a transparent and substantia l public engagement process has also been critical to the success thus far.

While proponents were free to submit proposals for only one or a small number of facilities, a proponent that operates concessions at several facilities might be in a position to balance out their overall profits between high- and low-traffic facilities and therefore provide more consistency in service levels and operating hours than we currently have. ● We take our obligations to fair procurement processes seriously, follow trade agreements and honour our commitments. ● We received many strong bids. In this case a conclusion was reached that will fulfil the need for more consistent service across several City venues. ● Administration understands that some sites, like Victoria Golf Course, are destinations for many patrons year round, and we are confident that this NRFP process will provide the specialized services that this site requires. Approach : Communications will respond to requests from the media, while respecting the fact that the NRFP is still open and negotiations continue. Administration can provide details to City Council for their information, but neither Administration or Council are able to publicly speak to details of any proposal. We are able to respond to questions about the process only. Background Due to the range of facilities the City of Edmonton operates and the level of traffic that passes through each one, there are current disparities between the food services offered at these facilities. In facilities where food operators have shut down or reduced business hours due to low levels of foot traffic, some Edmontonians are losing out on food service all together. This disparity is also evident in golf courses. One of the intentions of the NRFP was to bring up the level of service among all golf courses, in a way that ensures financial success for a potential partner. The NRFP for the next term was issued on January 29, with an effective date of April 1, 2018. This is the first time an NRFP was issued for 14 facilities simultaneously. The NRFP asked for service that would satisfy a variety of scenarios, from grab-and-go kiosks, to park service, carts and full-service dining. In the NRFP, the ability to serve more than one facility was weighted five per cent. The City’s procurement processes are structured and aligned with trade agreements in place for public sector organizations to ensure open and non-discriminatory procurement.* Under these trade agreements, we are not able to give extra points to local business. Proponents are provided with the evaluation criteria and scoring system with the NRFP and have the opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions while the RFP is open. Procurement staff are also available to debrief with proponents after the NRFP is closed and a contract has been signed with the preferred proponent. As per Canadian Procurement law and regulation, the City can only evaluate the contents of a proposal. Our evaluation committee cannot give points for any information they have about a proponent that is not explicitly provided in the proponent’s proposal. The contract for the restaurant space at Muttart is not set to expire and was not included in this NRP. *Agreements include: the New West Partnership Trade Agreement (NWPTA), the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) and Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).

Background As of April 1, 2018, the Provincial Ombudsman will have jurisdiction to review complaints against municipalities. This is as a result of the proclamation of amendments to the Municipal Government Act (MGA) as part of the MGA Review. The Ombudsman will have the authority to investigate complaints from members of the public, including City staff, that relate to decisions made or actions taken by administration from a procedural fairness point of view. Complainants must exhaust all legal appeal options before the Ombudsman is able to investigate a matter, as the Ombudsman is the option of last resort. In anticipation of this change, Administration is working to ensure all internal areas with some responsibility for handling public complaints understand the provincial Ombudsman’s expanded role and the impact this change will have on their area. Key Messages ● As part of the amendments to the Municipal Government Act , the Alberta Ombudsman can now review complaints about municipalities and, if required, launch investigations into perceived unfair treatment about municipal decisions and the decision-making processes. This change takes effect April 1, 2018. ● The Ombudsman does not have authority to overturn the City’s decision on any matter, but may review the process that led to that decision. ● The City of Edmonton currently has a robust system for handling a variety of public complaints including: ○ Through the 311 call centre, ○ Council members directly, ○ Council and Committee meetings and public hearings where residents can bring issues directly to Council, and ○ Appeal processes through bodies such as the Subdivision Development and Appeal Board (SDAB) and the Assessment Review Board (ARB). ● The Alberta Ombudsman is the office of last resort for complaints. Before the Ombudsman can become involved, the complainant must have used all legal appeal options. Interim Process Inquiries from the Ombudsman’s Office may be routed as follows, depending on the nature of the inquiry: ● If the Ombudsman is referring a member of the public to a specific department within the City of Edmonton, the key contact will be 311 which then can route the public to the appropriate person. ● If the Ombudsman is referring a current City of Edmonton staff with employment related concerns, then the key contact will be Deloitte (Call toll-free 1-844-298-6782 Email: info@coecomplaints.ca). ● If the Ombudsman is referring a resident with a constituency issue, the resident can contact their ward Councillor or the Mayor. ● When a formal investigation involving the City is launched, the City Manager will be the contact. As more information is made available by the Province, City Administration will develop a more comprehensive process for handling complaints and inquiries from the Ombudsman. Next Steps In the coming days and weeks, Administration will roll out communication activities to inform all City employees about the Ombudsman’s expanded role.

The Household Travel Survey (HTS), led by the City of Edmonton in partnership with the Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board and Alberta Transportation, is currently completed on a 10 year cycle. The survey results describe the weekday travel patterns of residents in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region for a 24 hour weekday period. The data from the HTS is used by the City of Edmonton, Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board, and Alberta Transportation to support long-term transportation planning in Edmonton and the surrounding region. The data helps identify infrastructure investments within and across municipal boundaries with the aim of supporting a multi-modal transportation system to better faci litate the movement of people, goods and services throughout the region. Two documents are attached for reference. The first is a short overview of key trends and the second is a larger report summarizing the survey results.

Administration is reviewing the Regulation and will provide Council with an analysis on next steps for implementing the various provisions (update to Council expected later this spring). ● This is the same version of the City Charter Regulation that had been posted for 60 days for public review and feedback since January 2018, and was a revised version of what had been posted from August - October 2017. ● City Charters will allow Edmonton and Calgary to develop unique approaches to delivering the services that residents and businesses of these big cities need and expect. Discussions between the Province and the two cities have been ongoing since 2014. ● There are three main elements to the Charters project: enabling legislation and regulations, a fiscal framework, and ongoing formalized collaboration. Aspects of all three have been shared for public feedback in the past two years. For details see Government of Alberta City Charters website. Charter Regulation ● The Regulation just approved by Cabinet is made up of numerous provisions, encompassing several aspects of City administration including governance, assessment and taxation, city planning and environment. See Charter Regulation Provisions Overview for brief descriptions of each of the provisions. ● The majority of the provisions are enabling, meaning the City (through Council) can choose whether to implement them; others come into force immediately. ● Those provisions coming into force immediately have a retroactive coming-into-force date of January 1 , 2018. This will ensure that these provisions - primarily assessment and taxation  related - are in alignment with the assessment and taxation year that begins January 1. Fiscal Framework and Collaboration Tables ● The focus of the fiscal framework discussions have been on enhancements of a few existing fiscal tools and replacement of the capital grant system with an infrastructure funding formula based on provincial revenues. This is in line with the Government of Alberta’s decision to not allow any new taxes or revenue streams for the cities. Discussions are still ongoing on exploring what this new fiscal framework might look like. ● Discussions have been underway at a number of collaboration tables related to affordable housing, urban schools, and clean energy loan program. The initial meeting of the transportation/ infrastructure table will be held soon. Additional policy and planning tables addressing other issues of shared interest such as poverty and energy micro-generation are expected to be established in the coming months. The collaboration tables provide a forum for the City of Edmonton, City of Calgary and the Government of Alberta to work together on emerging ‘big city’ issues that warrant a coordinated response towards shared outcomes. Regulation Next Steps ● Implementation of amendments stemming from the City Charter will unfold over the coming years. It is imperative that the City have a coordinated and integrated approach as these changes will have corporate-wide impacts. However, Council will begin to see certain new processes immediately, such as the use of the title “Charter Bylaw” for bylaws that now require this wording. ● City Administration has launched its implementation planning process for both the Charter and MGA changes, which was initially shared with Council on January 23, 2018. Now that the Charter Regulation has come into force, the Charter enabled changes will be part of the implementation process, in a similar manner with which the MGA changes are being handled. ● The decisions on which City Charter and MGA-enabled provisions are implemented, and how, will occur over the course of 2018 and 2019. Administration expects this to be a public process, and one where Council will have the opportunity to identify their priorities for implementation of the enabling provisions reflected in the Charter Regulation, MGA amendments and other associated regulations. ● A second batch of regulatory provisions that had been delayed under the Charter process are currently being finalized and could be posted for public review and feedback by early summer. Once those have been approved, they will undergo a similar process as this current grouping of provisions. If you have any questions or would like to sch","ike to schedule a meeting to discuss the City Charters in more detail, please do not hesitate to contact me or Nancy Jacobsen at 780-423-4022.

While CAAC is in a state of management and organizational transition, Administration continues to meet and liaise with the Board of Directors regarding the governance and financial responsibilities laid out through our formal funding agreements. As indicated in correspondence sent April 4, 2018, Administration has taken steps to initiate an audit of the organization's financial and governance/management practices. The funding agreements permit the City to audit the Society's financial records, and we have requested that the Society provide permission for the City Auditor to conduct a governance and management audit at the same time. Administration has been informed by the Board that they agree to the financial audit and we are waiting for a motion approving the expanded management and governance audit. The governance/management audit would add value by identifying opportunities to improve operational effectiveness. In conjunction with these actions, Administration has extended the existing operating funding agreement into their new fiscal year. The provision of bridge funding similar to the 2017 operations funding amounts will be released in monthly installments. In conversation with the Board, it has been emphasized that these steps are intended to allow the organization to continue regular operations during the organization's time of transition.

Minchau Blacksmith Shop, 8108 - 101 Street NW, Ritchie, Application to Demolish",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=10dD9YTDPoXwrmAuRe3gBOddDpAAZnnDb)","Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development has received a development permit application which proposes the demolition of the A. Minchau Blacksmith Shop, located at 8108 – 101 Street NW in the Ritchie Neighbourhood. The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton 1993. Built in 1925, the A. Minchau Blacksmith Shop is valued for its association with the early industrial development of Edmonton. The one-storey building is characterized by its red-brick façade and stepped parapet that is typical of the utilitarian commercial structures in this area. Few buildings of this industrial nature have been retained as reminders of the importance of working-class districts and small entrepreneurial operations in Edmonton and Alberta. The building is of brick construction, and features painted ghost signs advertising the blacksmith operations on both the east and west elevations. The building is named after Adolf Minchau, who was listed as a blacksmith in the area as early as 1911. The Minchau family emigrated from Poland, where they lived in one of the German settlement enclaves, to Strathcona in 1894. The family homesteaded land in the Millwoods area for more than 80 years, and were known to host ploughing competitions on their farm in the 1930s. The Minchau’s also owned property in the German-Canadian enclave east of the CPR right-of-way. The Minchau Neighbourhood in Mill Woods and Minchau School are both named after the family. Adolf Minchau purchased the subject site in 1920, and constructed the blacksmith shop in 1925. The building has been modified from its original construction, namely the removal of the second storey from the building sometime after 1966 (see historic photos included in Attachment 2). Most of the windows and doors on the front façade have been replaced, but the remainder of the structure is largely original. A one-storey garage structure was added to the south side of the building at some point, perhaps in the 1970s, or 1980s. The owner/applicant has been informed of the financia l (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. Discussions with the owner in this regard have been underway since 2015. Options presented to the owner included t he retention of the 101 Street fa~ade only, and incorporating it into new development on the site. The owner has informed the Heritage Management Unit that they do not wish to designate the property. The owner has provided and met the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources on the Inventory, as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. The property is zoned DC2 129, approved by City Council in 1987. Specifically, the DC2 identifies t his site as Site A, and provides for a high rise residentia l/commercial development up to 12 storeys in height. The owner has not applied for any new development on the site, but has indicated the intention to develop the site in accordance with the opportunity provided under DC2 129. Alberta Culture and Tourism has been informed of the proposed demolition of the building, and are undertaking an independent eva luation of the historic significance of the structure from a Provincial perspective. The Province is considering what potential intervention, if any, may be appropriate, but have not committed to a position at this time. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent. For your information, this represents the fourth demolition of a property on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week.  c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Branch Manager, Development Services Linda Sahli, City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton by Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development in 2017 at the request of the former owner. Built in 1912 (possibly in 1898 and moved onto the current location in 1912), the Spurr Residence is valued for its association with the early development of the Crestwood Neighbourhood. It may be one of the oldest extant homes in the community. The Spurr Residence is further valued as an early example of the Foursquare Architectural Style. The roof is a medium pitch hip with projecting eaves. The south elevation features two original window openings on the upper floor, and the entrance on the west side. All window openings on the building are original; however, all original windows have been replaced. The south façade of the building has been altered to accommodate an extension of the living room area. The addition was added in 1976. The original wood siding of the house was retained under the newer aluminum siding, which was added at the same time as the addition in 1976. Land in the area was originally owned by Samuel Wilkinson, starting in 1885. Ownership transferred to James Gibbons, a prominent farmer and business owner, in 1892, through his administration of Wilkinson’s estate. Portions of the land were further owned by Philip Crowley until a plan of subdivision was prepared in 1908. James Gibbons continued to own land in the area, including the site that ultimately became 14326 – 99 Avenue, until 1913. It is unclear if the house was already built at this point, or was constructed in 1912, but Gibbons did not reside in the home. In 1919, Cecil Derbyshire, an engineer with Edmonton Cold Storage, purchased the property. In 1920, Derbyshire appears to have started working at May-Gorman Aeroplan Company Ltd., and is listed with his wife Doris, a stenographer with Edmonton City Dairy. The Spurr fami ly purchased th e property on March 1, 1965, and it remained in the Spurr family ownership until February of 2018. The new owner/applicant has been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives avai lable to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The new owner has informed the Heritage Management Unit that they do not wish to designate the property. The new owner has provided and met the Special Information Requirements for historic resources on the Inventory, as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. The residence is in fair condition, with possible foundation issues, aluminum cladding over the original wood, several windows replaced and mechanical/plumbing/electrical sys tems needing replacement. The new owner does not feel the configuration of the interior of the house meets current market expectations, and does not feel a complete renovation of the interior is economically feasible. This property is currently zoned (RF1 ) Single Detached Residentia l Zone. The owner has applied for a development permit to construct a new single detached dwelling on t he site. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent.

The buildings were added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 1993. Construction on the Nightingale Nursing Home began in 1912, and it opened in 1914. Agnes McBride was the superintendent of the facility. Its time at 10833 – 83 Avenue NW was short-lived, as the facility relocated to 11326 – 103 Avenue NW in 1915. The property was used as a residence after that, with Laurie B. Elliot as the owner in 1915. While largely original, there have been some modifications to the building, namely the introduction of additional dormers on the front and rear of the building, which have altered the roofline and the building’s appearance to some degree. The J.M. Kinnear Residence was constructed in 1912 for John Morris Kinnear, a cashier for the Alberta Treasury Department. By 1915, Kinnear was Secretary-Treasurer of the Tipton Investment Company Ltd., a prominent Edmonton real estate company that was involved in some of the early development of the Garneau Neighbourhood.

The two bui ldings are part of a larger site on the south side of 83 Avenue made up of five separate single detached dwellings (the other three residences on the overa ll site are not on t he Inventory of Historic Resources; see image in Attachment 2). A development permit for a 44-unit, four-storey apartment building was or iginally approved on the overall site in 2015; however, the owner proposed modifications to the design under a new development permit, which was subsequently approved by Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development in October 2016. The owner is now ready to move forward with preparing the site for the new development. The owner has undertaken extensive salvage of interior materials of the two Inventory buildings for re-use elsewhere, rendering the interiors substantially damaged. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the abi lity to designate a structure as a Municipa l Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act f urther requ ires that the owner of the stru cture be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent. For your information, these represent the fifth and sixth demolitions of properties on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. A total of nine properties on the Inventory of Historic Resources demolished in 2017. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Manager, Development Services Linda Sahli, City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

The last major rehabilitation of this bridge was carried out between 1989 and 1990. To extend its useful life, this bridge requires a major rehabilitation. Construction on the bridge starts on April 23, 2018 and the contract completion date is late 2020. In an effort to maintain this key river crossing route, one lane of traffic in each direction will be maintained for the duration of the project. The bridge’s capacity will be reduced by fifty percent during construction and, as a result, traffic in the vicinity of the project is expected to flow at a slower rate. Notices will be issued to recommend that commuters use alternate routes, if possible, particularly during peak travel times. In accordance with the City’s commitment to public safety, the project team will continually review signal timing, turning and merging movements adjacent to the construction zone and will make modifications to signal operations and merging ramps as required throughout the duration of construction. Although some portion of the Emily Murphy Park parking lot will be used as the project laydown area, both Emily Murphy Park and the access to the park will stay open to public throughout the duration of the project. Moreover, pedestrian and vehicular access will also be maintained to Hawrelak Park at all times. The project team is working with all the major stakeholders including: Festivals and Events Liaison, River Valley Parks and Facilities supervisor, Edmonton Transit Service (ETS), Heritage Festival Liaison, University of Alberta, and Alberta Health Services representatives to ensure all events in the area are aware of the construction schedule. The City is working with the Edmonton Heritage Festival to ensure adequate access to Hawrelak Park is available during the festival. This includes a work stoppage to allow traffic to flow into and out of the park. ETS routes will not be adversely impacted due to this construction project; however, additional time will be added to ETS bus routes 128 and 130 as required during construction. More information on ETS bus schedule changes is available at etstripplanner.edmonton.ca/DetoursAndClosures.aspx .Commuters are advised to check the website before starting their trip. The City has been using electronic Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) to inform the public of the upcoming construction on this project. Roadside construction information signs will also be installed to inform commuters about traffic pattern changes during the various phases of construction, in addition to communicating with the public through the project website, traffic updates, and other channels as required. Motorists are advised to exercise caution and follow traffic control devices to safely navigate through the construction zone. The City will provide periodic updates on edmonton.ca/GroatRoadBridges and through social media. Citizens can also sign up for email updates at: groatroadbridges@edmonton.ca .

A s part of City Council's approved plan in 2012 and funding approval in 2014, the City has replaced parking meters with EPark technology using pay-by-plate technology for both on and off street parking operations . Currently, parking enforcement is done by beat patrol bylaw officers who manually write tickets. Effective May 15, 2018, the City of Edmonton will move to automated parking enforcement using camera-mounted vehicles to scan licence plates and identify vehicles not registered as paid on the EPark system. This new digital technology will significantly improve enforcement regulation and better aligns Edmonton parking services with smart city initiatives demonstrated by most major Canadian cities. Automated parking enforcement will also free up the beat patrol bylaw officers to deal with other parking issues that come up across the city, including in school zones, tow away zones during rush hour and residential areas where parking is restricted. Automated parking enforcement will initially be rolled out in EPark zones downtown, in Old Strathcona and in City-owned parking lots and parkades where wall-mounted cameras will scan licence plates. General impact to citizens of Edmonton Similar to a photo radar ticket, if the vehicle has not paid or the payment time has expired, a ticket will be mailed by Canada Post to the vehicle’s owner as opposed to placed under the windshield wiper. All other parking violations will continue to follow the manual process (manual ticket placed on the windshield). Impact to Accessible Parking Placard Holders This new licence plate recognition technology cannot accommodate hanging placards, in particular, accessibility placards. As a result, the two-hour courtesy parking for those with accessibility placards will be discontinued. Parking Services has engaged the City of Edmonton Accessibility Committee to inform of these changes. Due to limited exposure to the greater accessible community, we will work towards a better understanding of their needs moving forward. Understanding that this is a change for the accessibility community, we have a process in place to cancel tickets issued to those with valid accessibility placards for a two month period following implementation. This will give some additional time for the accessible community to become familiar with the change. Over the next year, Administration will be working with the accessible parking placard community to better understand their parking needs. Part of this engagement will be to identify and create more designated accessible parking spots within the City’s EPark zones to address some of the challenges accessible parking placard holders currently face with regards to finding places to park on-street in EPark areas. A communication plan is being implemented to educate and provide information to affected citizens on these changes. We will also, continue to work with the Accessible Advisory Committee and other interested stakeholders. Impact on revenue Upon implementation, we will be issuing warnings for a two-week period to help educate and inform citizens of the change. As a result of the warning process, parking violation tickets in EPark zones will not be issued resulting in an enforcement revenue loss during this time. If you have any questions relating to the Automated Parking Enforcement Program please contact David Aitken, Branch Manager, Community Standards and Neighbourhoods at 780-496-5207.

Administration would like to share this update with City Council to introduce the preferred route in advance of sharing it with impacted landowners, stakeholders and the general public in June 2018. This update also summarizes the study’s background, and the evaluation process conducted to select the preferred route from six feasible route combinations within the project study area.The feasible options were presented in a briefing memo shared with you on October 24, 2017. Study Background, Process and Schedule This study will deliver the concept plan and identify land requirements for the preferred route of the river bridge crossing and connecting freeway, including cost estimates and major interchange (access) locations. The study will also recommend updates to the Horse Hill and Edmonton Energy and Technology Park (EETP) Area Structure Plans; formally designating the land for the future freeway until construction occurs, thereby reducing uncertainty over future development plans in this area. This study commenced in 2016 when the City of Edmonton, Alberta Transportation, Strathcona County, City of Fort Saskatchewan, and Sturgeon County identified the need to complete a study to identify the location of a new north-east river crossing and connecting freeways. The planned construction schedule is many years from now. The City of Edmonton, Alberta Transportation and these municipalities are joint planning and funding partners, and are referred to as the “Project Partner Team” (PPT). This study includes three phases, which are described below. Phase 3 of the study is currently underway. ● Phase 1: Study Appraisal (October 2016 to April 2017) - Understand study area conditions, constraints and opportunities (COMPLETE) ● Phase 2: Option Development (May 2017 to February 2018) - Develop and evaluate feasible routes (COMPLETE) ● Phase 3: Development of Recommended Route (February 2018 to December 2018) - Preparation of conceptual plans and recommendations for the preferred route (UNDERWAY) Preferred Route The preferred route for the bridge crossing and freeway is presented in Attachment 1 . This route begins at the existing Highway 28A/Highway 15 (Manning Drive) intersection, crosses the North Saskatchewan River at approximately 195 Avenue and proceeds due east to connect with Highway 21 in Strathcona County. From there, the route follows the existing alignment of Highway 21 south to Township Road 535. In total, six feasible route combinations were evaluated by the PPT across five performance criteria including financial, environment, road/user benefits, community sustainability and economy. The results of the evaluation are presented in Attachment 2 . For reference, the six feasible route combinations are presented in Attachment 3 . These routes include three unique freeway alignments within the City of Edmonton, north of the North Saskatchewan River, which connect to two unique freeway alignments in Strathcona County, for a total of six combinations. Policy Alignment This bridge crossing and freeway is in alignment with the policies and priorities of Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board (EMRB). The route is identified as part of the planned regional transportation system in the approved 2016 Growth Plan , and more recently the EMRB has recommended the planning of this bridge and freeway as a top planning priority for the municipalities and Alberta Transportation. City of Edmonton departments were also engaged to understand the policy implications of the river bridge and freeway routes. Discussions are ongoing with the departments to identify regulatory and policy impacts and provide recommendations as part of this study. Three consistent themes emerged from this engagement, including preservation of protected environmentally sensitive areas in Edmonton; conserving agriculture resources; and enhancing economic opportunities in the EETP. At this time, Administration would like to highlight the following benefits and implications of the preferred route: ● Impacts to environmentally sensitive areas identified in the Horse Hill Area Structure Plan are avoided. This aligns with City policy included in the Horse Hill Area Structure Plan , the City’s Environmental Strategic Plan, The Way We Green and the City’s Natural Area System","ural Area Systems Policy C-531 to protect and conserve these areas. ● The preferred option minimizes the length of the North Saskatchewan River crossing, and moreover, the concept for a wildlife passage on the Edmonton side of the crossing is being developed. This aligns with City Policy in the North Saskatchewan River Valley Areas Redevelopment Plan (Bylaw 7188) that all crossing distances be minimized, and environmental impacts be fully assessed, including wildlife impacts. ● The preferred option moderately impacts agricultural resources, which are designated to be retained under the Horse Hill Area Structure Plan, under direction from The Way We Grow and fresh , Edmonton’s Food and Urban Agriculture Strategy. We are now considering how to minimize and, where possible, mitigate these impacts in the design of the freeway. ● The preferred route provides the most flexibility and may allow additional access to the EETP area. Public Engagement Impacted stakeholders from the study area and the general public were engaged during Phases 1 and 2 of the study. In Phase 1, they were asked to share their knowledge and priorities for the study area. This input was used to inform the development of the feasible route options. In Phase 2, the river bridge and freeway routes and the evaluation performance criteria were shared with the public and impacted stakeholders who were asked to provide input on the options as well as the criteria. A full summary of the key themes and how this input was used in the decision-making process is under development and will be presented to impacted residents and stakeholders at a planned stakeholder meeting in June, and to all stakeholders and the general public at a public event in June. Two main themes that have emerged from public engagement during Phase 1 and 2 include the existing residential community and agricultural impacts. With regards to the residential community, landowners in the study area asked the PPT, to minimize the impacts to the existing communities and to consider acquiring land as soon as possible. The landowners also requested consideration of the impacts caused by splitting the residential communities. With regard to agricultural impacts, landowners in Horse Hill asked the PPT to minimize loss and splitting of agricultural lands identified in the Horse Hill Area Structure Plan, and to consider the benefits to social agencies and the City provided by the existing market gardens and agricultural land. Accordingly, Administration has placed a high value on both of these considerations, which is reflected in the relative weighting under the ‘Community’ account in the attached evaluation. This evaluation concludes that the preferred option best addresses and balances overall impacts to both residential and agricultural lands of the feasible alternatives, however, this option does still moderately impact both. Upcoming Meetings A meeting is being planned to share the preferred route directly with impacted residents and stakeholders before the general public events. This meeting will be by invitation only. We will share the date of this meeting as soon as it is available, but it will likely be in mid-June, before the general public meetings. This will allow us to hear their comments and concerns directly. We, therefore, ask that the attached preferred route be kept confidential until the planned stakeholder meeting. The two public meetings are planned for June 13 and 14, 2018 to share the preferred route with the general public. The details of the meetings are below: Date and Time Location / Details June 13, 2018 Drop-In between 4 and 8 PM Bethel Church 298 Bethel Dr, Sherwood Park June 14, 2018 Drop-In between 4 and 8 PM Horse Hill School 19355 Meridian St, Edmonton Next Steps Following the public meetings, the next steps of this study include the preparation of the conceptual plans for the river bridge and freeway and preparation of a concept planning report with recommendations for the preferred route. An information report to Council outlining the preferred route for the river bridge and connecting freeways is planned late 2018. An amendment to the Horse Hill and EETP ASP will also be required to align the land use plans with with the preferred route.

These include the UPass, Leduc Commuter-Plus monthly pass, and a special Route 747 transfer issued by Leduc Transit. In return, Leduc Transit will accept a special ETS transfer from Route 747 customers to continue their journey on Leduc Transit. ETS regular passes, tickets and transfers, as well as Leduc Transit regular passes are not accepted on Route 747. If a customer would like to transfer to another ETS service upon arrival at the Century Park Transit Centre, regular ETS fares apply. These changes will be communicated to customers through A-frames at the bus stops, ETS Connect, and social media. In addition, starting June 1, 2018, the price of an ETS monthly airport pass will be reduced from $100 to $90. These fare changes supplement those implemented on May 1, 2018, when one-way fares were reduced from $10 or 4 ETS Adult tickets to $5 or two ETS Adult tickets. These combined actions fulfill the direction passed by Council on April 24, 2018 to take steps towards integration of transit within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. Residents in Edmonton, City of Leduc and Leduc County will be able to travel through the region more seamlessly now.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2010, as part of the McCauley/Alberta Avenue Historic Resources Inventory project. Built in 1926, the Miller Residence is significant for its Arts and Crafts influences, in particular, Craftsman design elements. It is associated with the original, long-term resident Gotlieb Miller, a farmer and then a labourer. Miller was typical of residents of working class neighbourhoods such as McCauley. Design elements include the medium pitch gable roof with original roof brackets, soffits and fascia, and exposed rafters. There is an open front porch with two tapered pillars and closed railings. Two tripartite windows flank either side of the main door. The Miller Residence, built in the McCauley area in the first quarter of the twentieth century following the end of the First World War and the upswing in building that resulted, exemplifies the popularity of this type of house in the early days of McCauley. Miller lived in the house from 1926 to 1942, after which time Mrs. Gotlieb Miller (Lena) is listed as the occupant until 1946. The owner/applicant has been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The owner has informed the Heritage Management Unit that they do not wish to designate the property . The owner has provided and met the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources on the Inventory as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. The property is zoned DC1 (Area 6) under the direction of the Boyle-McCauley Area Redevelopment Plan. The DC1 provides for low density housing in a variety of forms. The owner has applied to develop a new semi-detached dwelling on the subject site. Alberta Health Services issued an Order to Vacate to the previous owners of the property in May 2017 due to several unaddressed building condition issues. The Order remains on the property at this time, which is vacant. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent. For your information, this represents the seventh demolition of a property on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. A total of nine properties on the Inventory of Historic Resources were demolished in 2017. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Manager, Development Services Linda Sahli, City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

Given recent Council discussions and direction about playground zones, I am providing background information. The Speed Zones Bylaw is regularly updated to reflect the transition of rural roads to City roads, to add speed limits in areas of new development, and to make other necessary adjustments. This particular update (Bylaw 18391) continues amendments to the Speed Zones Bylaw which reflect Council's decisions last September to add playground zones and to replace school zones with playground zones (see report CR_ 4940 - Playground Zone Speed Limits - Implementation and Funding Plan). This update is required to ensure the bylaw is consistent with the signage in playground zones. Bylaw 18391 also proposes minor adjustments to speed limits in various locations throughout the city. These minor amendments were identified as part of Administration's ongoing review of speed limits within the city in order to reflect changes in road design, expansions and road network changes. All proposed changes meet current design standards for speed management. In accordance with Council's direction in early May, additional work is being done to review 41 identified playgrounds and to evaluate implementation of these zones across the city. A report is scheduled to come back to Council in August. Any bylaws resulting from decisions in the fall would follow thereafter.

Along with the sale, the City will also surrender 25 Park & Ride stalls leased from the developer that would have otherwise been surrounded by the developer’s private Park & Ride operation. The sale of the land and transition of the stalls is conditional on City Council approving the proposed rezoning of the L-shaped parcel to incorporate it into the planned urban village development. The proposed rezoning is scheduled to go to City Council Public Hearing for a decision on May 28, 2018. If approved, ownership of the 216 City-managed Park & Ride stalls will shift to the developer on June 1. Of the remaining 864 City-managed Park & Ride stalls at Century Park, there will be 221 free stalls (68 fewer) and 643 reserved paid stalls (138 fewer). Customers affected by this change will be informed in advance of their options. It is expected all the remaining City-managed stalls at Century Park will transition in stages back to the developer prior to the end of March 2020, when the City’s lease with the developer expires. The developer intends to operate the privately-owned surface Park & Ride lots until 2025 or construction begins on the site. As the site builds out, the developer will replace the surface Park & Ride lots with shared parkade and underground parking structures. This conversion will be tied to active building construction and is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. Stadium Station On June 8, 2018 there will be 50 fewer free parking stalls at the Stadium Park & Ride location, leaving 306 free stalls and 163 paid reserve stalls available for commuters. This adjustment is due to Transit Oriented Development construction of the new Muttart Crossing access road. Customer notifications Any affected customers paying for a City-managed reserved stall at Century Park will be directly contacted. They have the option of going on the waitlist for another City-managed stall or making independent arrangements at the developer’s private Park & Ride lot . Free and reserved parking customers at both locations will also be informed through a variety of communication methods, including social media, web notifications, and 311.

This initiative promotes the benefits of grasscycling (leaving grass clippings on the lawn), and provides residents with information and resources to encourage and enable voluntary adoption of the practice. Key messages for this campaign are attached . Grasscycling is an ongoing topic of conversation for many Edmontonians. Given this, we are combining our efforts to promote the benefits of the practice, and to use this summer yard season as an opportunity to gather information from our residents. The campaign will link with the broader public engagement activities with efforts to gather feedback on potential changes to grass, leaf and yard waste collection. This will inform final recommendations. Administration is making every effort to ensure this work facilitates engagement and does not presuppose what program changes will look like. Go Bagless messaging will invite residents to submit feedback through an online comment form at edmonton.ca/futureofwaste . This feedback will be gathered and added to what we heard through the general public survey, the multi-unit stakeholder survey and the public drop-in sessions held in April 2018. An overview of all feedback will be shared with Utility Committee, Council and the public in the fall. There are two components to our Go Bagless campaign: 1) Targeted door-to-door canvassing (May 29 - July 13) Households disposing of grass are identified along select collection routes each day. Those households are canvassed during the evening. Residents are engaged in conversations about grasscycling. Canvassers will provide information and resources, collect feedback, answer questions and invite people to complete an online comment form. 2) General marketing campaign (June 15 - August 15) This promotes broad awareness of grasscycling through a mix of communication and marketing channels. It directs residents to information about grasscycling, and leads them to an online comment form. Grasscycling is an effective means of reducing waste and increasing diversion from landfill. Over 62,000 residences have been visited through this canvassing program since it was introduced. Go Bagless will continue to serve as an effective waste-reduction initiative for 2018, and to promote an opportunity for residents to provide additional feedback on grass, leaf and yard waste services.

During the discussion, several concerns were ra ised by citizens regarding the negative impacts some of these rentals are having on neighbouring properties. While Development Services is working towards developing a long term strategy to regulate this new industry, Community Standards and Neighbourhoods is working to implement interim measures to help address concerns that arise from these properties. Bylaw enforcement officers currently have several tools to help deal with residential property standards offences under the Community Standards Bylaw and the Traffic Bylaw. Common complaints about unsightly property conditions, improper waste disposa l, unkempt grass and weeds, illegal fire pits, noise, unshoveled sidewalks and parking offences can be addressed through enforcement to reduce impacts in neighbourhoods. Officers use a variety of methods to gain compliance which, if there is no history of violations, typica lly sta rts with one warning and escalates to fines and Municipal Government Act orders if voluntary compliance ca nnot be achieved. To ensure that the City is being responsive to complaints resulting from short term renta ls, several changes are being implemented until the long term strategy is complete: 1. Front line enforcement officers will monitor properties that have been identified as short term rental accommodations. Proactive patrols will be completed in order to address violations and educate property owners early to prevent potential issues from esca lating. 2. Officers wi ll monitor properties with multiple complaints against them more closely and will take an escalated enforcement approach in an attempt to encourage more property management by the property owner and to reduce recurring complaints. 3. Education material will be developed that will focus on issues related to short term rentals. This will include the development of an information page on edmonton.ca with a frequently asked questions section and an information sheet that will be distributed to short term rental property owners. This material wi ll outline property standards requirements and give guidance on managing a short term rental and being a good neighbour. 4. Changes will be made to 311 scripts to ensure complaints are being captured correctly and are being routed to enforcement officers more efficiently. When citizens identify a property is a short term rental, the fi le will be flagged by 311 for enforcement to attend to as a priority. Additional background information and more detail on specific bylaws offences that are common to short term rental properties are included as an attachment to this memorandum. If you require further information or have any additional questions regarding our intended approach, please feel free to contact David Aitken, Branch Manager, Community Standards and Neighbourhoods at 780-496-5207.

Publications will remain available to the public, at a significantly lower number, thus reducing City printing by over 9.5 million pages per year. Transitioning registered program print materials to a paper-free model has become best practice across many municipalities, and aligns with the City’s goals to establish a more environmentally and financially sustainable society. The City of Edmonton remains committed to providing citizens the most accurate and up-to-date information on recreation facilities, attractions, and programs through current online self-serve resources. These tools include: ● My Rec Guide ● Digital versions of the guides posted on the City of Edmonton website ● Facility pages on edmonton.ca My Rec Guide was launched in 2015, and will continue to be the primary resource citizens are encouraged to use. With this tool, citizens can create a customized program guide based on their age, location, interests, and facility. From there, they can save their customized guide in PDF format to their computer/mobile device, or print at their own convenience. In addition to online resources, citizens will still be able to connect with 311, the Edmonton Service Centre, and staff members at City of Edmonton facilities for program and facility information. Limited copies of the printed guides will be available at facilities and an evaluation will be completed after the first year. Since 2017, Administration has advised users that the guides will transition to a digital-only format in the fall 2018. Over the next few months, Administration will continue to communicate these changes with Edmontonians and direct them to My Rec Guide as their primary resource for information on programming in City recreation centres and attractions.

The Terms of Reference for the Community Liaison Committee has been finalized. Committee members agreed to close each meeting with consensus on key communication messages from the meeting. Participants are then responsible for sharing the key messages with the organizations and communities they represent. Key messages from the March 5. 2018 meeting • The committee will provide a common ground for information exchange and learning. • Consensus on the importance of rigor regarding information and accuracy of the data that is shared. • Data needs to be inclusive and start with a baseline using historical data prior to the opening of the locations. Key messages from the june 4. 2018 meeting • There is initial positive uptake and use of the two locations that are now open. Boyle Street Community Services is open 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday and George Spady is open 4:30-8:30 p.m. Monday to Friday and 24 hours on Saturday and Sunday. • Over 6,000 safe injections have occurred from over 650 unique individuals inside the safety of the supervised consumption locations as opposed to outside in public spaces. • 47 overdoses have been reversed in the supervised consumption locations since they opened. • Supervised consumption locations provide an additional opportunity for relationship development to connect people to wrap-around services. • Since the locations opened over 1,239 service refe rrals have been made with many of these referra ls to addiction and mental health programs. • The data is evolving. • Based on individuals accessing the services to date it is a smaller group of regular individ uals from the core communities; not individuals coming from other areas of the city. Edmonton Police Service also shared an update at the June 4 meeting indicating that there has been no substantial increase in drug or other related crime in the area since the Supervised Consumption Services locations opened.

Citizen Services has arranged for the placement of temporary solar powered trailer units and/or porta potties and is implement ing a schedule for them to be monitored, cleaned and maintained. The planned locations are identified on the attached map and include park spaces and residential and commercial areas. These locations were identified through discussions with citizens, City staff and Business Improvement Areas who provided information and insight regarding patterns of foot traffic, availability of existing public washrooms, and observations of public urination and defecation. The locations are subject to change in response to patterns of use and/or arising issues or concerns. A map of the washroom locations will be posted and regularly updated on Edmonton.ca/public-washroom-pilot.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2013, as part of the Strathcona/Queen Alexandra/Garneau/McKernan Historic Resources Inventory project. Built in 1939, the Solon Low Residence is significant for its Tudor Revival influences and for its association with the Honourable Solon Low. The Tudor Revival influences, whi le muted, are still evident in this residence. The design elements include the high pitch roof and cross gables, the ta ll chimney with cap and the multi-pane windows four by four and the two vertical windows two over five, and the flush eave. The offset side front entrance is another feature suggesting the picturesque design influences of larger more elaborate houses. The Honourable Solon Earl Low was the first known resident and resided in this home from 1941 to 1947. Mr. Low was a respected politician who was instrumental in the development of the Socia l Credit Party of Alberta and the Social Credit Association of Canada, and was National Leader of the Socia l Credit Party of sixteen years. As a high school teacher from Raymond, Alberta, Mr. Law's experiences during the depression years lead him to become a member of the Social Credit Party of Alberta. He ran for election to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1935, was elected and served for ten years. He became the Provincial Treasurer in 1937, but also served as the Minister of Education and later elected as the national leader of the Social Credit Association of Canada in 1944. Mr. Low was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1945 and remained in the position until his defeat in 1958. He then returned to teaching high school in the community of Raymond. He retired from teaching in 1961 and briefly served as family court judge for the Lethbridge and Medicine Hat districts before passing away in 1962. The owner/applicant has been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The owner has informed the Heritage Management Unit that they do not wish to designate the property. The owner has provided and met the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources on the Inventory as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. The owner has applied to develop a new detached dwelling on the subject site. Alberta Culture and Tourism has been advised of this application to demolish and they have indicated that this historic resource has no significance to the Province and will not intervene. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. For your information, this represents the ninth demolition of a property on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. A total of nine properties on the Inventory of Historic Resources were demolished in 2017. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Manager, Development Services Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

However, we did not adequately engage the community, and we realize that options must be in place before changing the system. Further to my verbal update to Council on June 26, 2018, the City of Edmonton is postponing the launch of automated parking enforcement which had originally been scheduled for July 15, 2018. This postponement will allow for more time to consult with the Accessibility Advisory Committee on any changes that may affect accessible placard holders, as well as to immediately proceed with identifying and creating more accessible parking stalls. We will also explore and report back on longer-term technology solutions to enable placard holders to continue parking free of charge in EPark zones once automated enforcement is implemented. We are taking immediate action to address concerns. We will review the current inventory of parking spots and identify opportunities for some immediate changes to increase the number of accessible spots. Additions such as ramps, while they take more time, will be added to those spots in the near future. In the coming months, we will engage with the broader community and identify other areas where accessible spots are needed. We will also further assess any technology options to allow placard holders to continue using EPark stalls free of charge. Potential technology solutions could include the use of radio-frequency identification tags on licence plates or licence plate registration for vehicle owners. We will work with Service Alberta, which is responsible for issuing placards, on finding an appropriate solution and determining feasibility. Throughout this process, parking enforcement will continue to be carried out by beat patrol bylaw officers. All vehicles with a valid active accessible placard can continue to park in any on-street EPark zone free of charge for up to two hours or as indicated by the signage.

Both Edmonton’s Transit Strategy and the 2016 City Auditor’s review of ETS recommended creation of a Fare Policy to provide guidance on how the City sets fares, applies discounts and recovers transit operating costs. The Fare Policy will also guide how fares and discounts are set up in the Smart Fare electronic payment system rolling out in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region in 2020. With that in mind, ETS is using an interactive online survey and targeted stakeholder workshops to ask citizens’ feedback and perspectives about: ● The best approach for setting discounts for various types of customers, such as seniors, youths and individuals experiencing low income; ● Whether Edmonton should recover transit operating costs in the same target range as other similar cities. For example, Edmonton currently recovers 40%-45% of costs through fares while other communities recover 40%-60%; ● What is their preference for minimum fares and maximum fare limits, if the City moves to distance-based fares with the introduction of Smart Fare technology. A variety of communications strategies are being used to encourage Edmontonians to fill out the interactive online survey running July 10-25 at edmonton.ca/fares . In addition, the City is gathering face to face feedback through targeted stakeholder focus groups and workshops running from April to August. After completion of engagement, the feedback will be incorporated into the Draft Fare Policy that will be presented to City Council for consideration this fall.

Built in 1913, the William Marshall Residence is significant primarily for its Craftsman Architectural Style influences and for its association with the first owner William C. Marshall. The Craftsman Style influences are still evident in this residence. The design elements include the cross gable roof, the wrap around verandah with shingled columns, roof brackets and the multi-pane windows (nine over one). The front door features two small windows on each side. William C. Marshall was the first known resident who resided in this home. Very little information is available on Mr. Marshall except that he was an accountant with Killen and Gilbert. The property is zoned (RF3) Small Scale Infill Development Zone. The owner/applicant has been informed of the financial (from the Heritage Resources Reserve) and zoning incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The owner has advised that they do not wish to designate the property. They have applied for demolition as the state of disrepair makes renovation financially and practically unfeasible.

Eng., Deputy City Manager","Snow and Ice Control - Next Steps",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wIdPiDZYGXal_kPhPVT6e0HOF4dctGy2)","Last week, Administration met with the Community and Public Services C ommittee to share an update on the Sand Recycling Audit as well as the Snow and Ice Control Program, more specifically with regard to the anti-icing pilot conducted in the winter of 2017-18. Below is an update on Administration’s next steps for snow and ice control. Generally, Administration uses techniques like plowing, sweeping, sanding and salting to manage snow and ice and achieve bare pavement. This approach balances keeping people safe, increasing access and mobility during the winter months, treating taxpayer dollars responsibly, and minimizing environmental impacts. This past year, Edmonton applied calcium chloride to 2,800 km of road and bike lane surfaces. While this is already an established practice in communities from Alaska to Montana, this approach was implemented as the second phase of a multi-year pilot project. Preliminary results in the report discussed last week showed that spending was reduced without compromising safety and environmental performance. Administration is now undertaking three lines of work: bringing forward recommendations to update the current Snow and Ice Policy; adjusting operating practices; and beginning new work in priority areas. Requests for policy and financial decisions will be brought forward this fall. In October, proposed updates to the Snow and Ice Control policy will be brought forward. They will: - Adjust the service level for arterial and collector roads to reach bare pavement - Include service levels for protected bike lanes, shared use paths, and bus stops - Include plowing, sanding, salt, and calcium chloride as tools to achieve bare pavement - Include the use of corrosion inhibitors as part of the snow and ice control program - Remove the requirement to recycle winter sand and allow other uses Also in the fall, a service package will be brought forward to purchase the specialized equipment necessary for optimizing the application of anti-icing and de-icing products. Operating practices are being adjusted for winter 2018-19. Planning is currently underway for a number of changes to be implemented for the 2018-19 winter season. Administration will: - Contract for high-speed plowing on arterial roads - Expand the calcium chloride pilot to cover more arterial and collector roads. Roads, protected bike lanes, and bus stops in the pilot this past year will continue to be piloted next year. - Wet the road salt before use, which reduces the quantity needed and increases the consistency of application. In addition, this will decrease the corrosiveness of the product. - Explore additional opportunities to communicate about keeping sidewalks safe. New work will be undertaken. To ensure there is Edmonton-based evidence about the impacts of winter road activities and potential for future improvements, Administration will: - Conduct on-site local research into corrosion impacts on vehicles and infrastructure - Conduct on-site local research on friction - Engage with residents about expectations for residential road clearing including how to implement seasonal parking bans and improve the level of service - Develop and deliver a pilot project for enhanced residential snow and ice control that is informed from the public engagement - Increase public education about changes to and benefits of the snow and ice control program. In response to a committee motion, Administration will also assess the effects of mandating snow tires including an industry scan of the mandatory use of snow tires in jurisdictions across North America and Europe. The review will include identification of legislative requirements and analysis of data about related collision and injury reduction. Combined, these efforts are intended to ensure that we are continuing to apply the best solutions in a changing climate, and that we are delivering services to the standard Edmontonians expect. I look forward to reviewing these and other courses of action at the Snow and Ice Control policy discussions in the fall. If you need any additional information in the meantime, please contact me.

The intent of this memo is to provide an update on how the City manages weed proliferation in shrub beds and along roadways. There are three landscape maintenance practices the City uses to limit weed proliferation. 1. Improving plant health care for the desired species of plants to outcompete weeds. 2. Mechanically removing weeds - trimming, mowing, and hand pulling. 3. Targeted herbicide application (where appropriate). In order to implement more environmentally conscious weed management practices, the City significantly decreased the use of herbicides for the past 15 years. In 2015, cosmetic herbicides usage was restricted with exceptions to areas that meet specific criteria. Maintenance of shrub beds across the city are performed primarily through mechanical weeding. Weeds continue to proliferate across the city for several reasons, mainly that: ● Edmonton is a Winter City and our green infrastructure is required to live through prolonged extreme winter temperatures. Moreover, the sand and salt used to keep the mobility network safe and accessible during the winter can damage the turf adjacent to the road. Once the turf is damaged or dies, weeds are able to establish themselves along the commuting corridor. ● Developers build attractive landscape designs of which many require long-term manicured maintenance programs prior to land being handed over to the City. Developers are able to use higher amounts of herbicide to control weeds as they are not under the same herbicide restrictions as the City. ● Mechanical means to remove weeds consume significantly more time and increase maintenance costs significantly when compared with targeted herbicide application. ● Some land along streets, newly constructed facilities, or parks may have trees, shrubs and grass in place for years that are not under the care of City crews. Until final inspections and all conditions are removed, the builder, contractor or developer maintains the land. ● Current resourcing for most of the City’s roadway shrub bed inventory crews are scheduled for service two times per year, however some weeds can take as few as three weeks to grow to maturity from seed. This year, to support the commitment to increase our service levels to Turf Operations per the funding and allocation by City Council within the enhanced turf package, staff were prioritized in the first six weeks of the growing season to mow weekly across the 4000 hectare citywide turf inventory and to control dandelions and other broadleaf weeds impacting higher profile sports fields. This resulted in a reallocation of human resources, and combined with a higher than anticipated staff attrition within Open Space Operations, led to limited resources at the beginning of growing season in shrub bed maintenance. In order to address the immediate need to increase service levels of maintenance to shrub beds along roadways, Open Space Operations staff have now been reallocated from Turf Operations. Additionally, ongoing deployment of teams are underway as they are being hired. Work on a longer term strategy is already underway including: ● Re-prioritization of resources, including the naturalization of some areas along arterials, collector roadways, and some areas adjacent to parks and residential areas. The City’s naturalization process begins with identifying areas that would benefit most from moving to a more natural landscape aesthetic. Instead of mowing, the site is maintained by City crews where noxious weeds are removed mechanically, as well as litter. Signs are placed in naturalization areas to inform citizens. ● Amendment work with Open Space Operations and Asset Management to the Landscaping Standards for arterial and collector roadways to allow for the safe and efficient collection and clearing of snow. This will allow for the survival of turf and significantly reduce the proliferation of weeds along arterial and collector roadways . ● Development of a program to renew high profile boulevard landscaping with more robust designs to better survive the winter. This profile, CM-66-2300 will be submitted in the fall of 2018 which includes components such as hard surface modifications, additional mobile planters, and renewal of the councillor amenity program elements. ● Implementation of different staffing models to support the horticulture program during the first six weeks of t","of the growing season in 2019. Horticulture adds animation and beauty across the City of Edmonton. Over 1000 planters and hanging baskets contribute to green infrastructure along the busiest and liveliest areas of the City. Shrub beds provide wind breaks, separate roadways from residential areas, help collect snow, delineate park areas, provide habitat for a variety of organisms, and are an ideal location for growing mature trees to full canopy. We continue to explore innovative ways to accomplish our horticulture work plan within the allocated budget while minimizing the proliferation of weeds. GC/AD/rs C: Linda Sahli, City Clerk","No",,,

City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton recognizes that the Benchmark Program is an important way for families, individuals and community groups to honour loved ones or special occasions through the installation of a new bench, or refurbishment of an existing bench, with a commemorative plaque. In light of public feedback, we are putting on hold our decision to require paid renewal of benches purchased before the current contract came into effect in August 2016. We will revisit our decision related to the Commemorative Bench Program, and our plan for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the program, keeping in mind the special meaning that these benches have for donors. Key Messages: ● We recognize that the Benchmark Program is an important way for families, individuals and community groups to honour loved ones or special occasions. We appreciate the emotional connection that people have to these special places in our city. ● We have heard concerns from some affected donors that, in some cases, the terms under which they originally became donors may not have been clear, and that some donors understood their commemorative term to be indefinite, without any end date for renewal. ● In light of public feedback, we are putting on hold our decision to require paid renewal of benches purchased before the current contract came into effect in August 2016. We will revisit our decision related to the Commemorative Bench Program, and our plan for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the program, keeping in mind the special meaning that these benches have for donors. ● We are also reaching out directly, via both telephone and letter, to the donors we previously contacted for renewal to ensure they are aware of our decision to revisit our approach. We will provide interim options, which may include reinstalling plaques, to families who have made the decision to renew or not renew while this review is under way. We are committed to understanding the perspective of donors surrounding the commemorative nature of the program. We will be able to provide more information on our approach to any possible renewal requirements or timelines in the months ahead. Approach : Communications has issued a statement to media indicating the City is putting on hold its decision to require paid renewal of benches in light of public feedback. The statement acknowledged the Benchmark Program as an important way for families, individuals and community groups to honour loved ones or special occasions, as well as the concerns that some citizens have raised with respect to the City’s recent decision to require paid renewal for benches installed between 1995 - 1998. Background: The Benchmark Program started in 1995 as a way for citizens to remember loved ones and special events. In 2016, City Administration conducted a cost assessment of the program and determined the program was not cost recoverable. For example, at the time, Administration determined that with 600 benches having been installed through the program, the City was unable to properly maintain the memorial benches with existing resources. As a result, a 10-year contract term was implemented in August 2016 for new donors. The change was made after reviewing similar programs in other Canadian municipalities, and with the goal of ensuring a sustainable program and keeping benches in good condition during their commemorative term. Administration also decided at this time that the change to a 10-year term would also apply to all past purchased benches. The changes were to be rolled out over time, based on the year of installation, with the 1995 - 1998 period as the first batch of benches (44 in total) to require renewal. In early 2018, Administration began contacting donors whose benches expired at the end of 2017 (i.e., all benches from 1995 - 1998) via phone telephone and a letter to inform them of changes to the program. Donors were given two months (April - May) to contact Administration regarding renewal before the plaques were to be removed. In June, approximately 30 plaques were removed for donors who chose not to renew and for donors that had not made contact wit","ct with Administration. A placeholder plaque was put in place for plaques that were removed. Administration is now contacting donors who were previously contacted for renewal to ensure they are aware the City is revisiting the decision to require paid renewal. Interim options are being discussed with donors, including reinstalling plaques while our review is under way.

This residence is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. Built in 1944, the Norgren Residence is a Colonial-Style Modern bungalow, significant for its architectural style and its association with the ongoing development of Calder during the Second World War Period. The residence represents a transitional style, prior to the introduction of the modern suburban architecture that would dominate the suburban environment until the mid-1960s. The property owner is seeking to demolish the property in order to build a duplex. They have been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource. The property owner has satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. For your information, this represents the 14 th application to demolish a property listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2018. A total of 9 applications were received to demolish properties listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in 2017. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

The pilot will include gathering and interpreting of vehicle noise level data, and recommendations for extreme noise mitigation. ● Priority will be given to locations which are identified as having the highest incidents of excessive vehicle noise. Due to limited test equipment, not all locations maybe monitored during this phase of the pilot. ● Eight locations (all quadrants of edmonton represented) will be chosen for the equipment installation. ● Four locations will have audio and video recording of the events and four will have audio recording accompanied with LCD (educational feedback) signs showing the sound level in decibels. ● Allowable maximum sound level signs will be posted at all locations. A detailed Strategic Communication Plan has been developed with key messages to respond to citizen and media inquiries and implementation tactics that include 311 update, sharing information with EPS and creation of the noise monitoring pilot webpage. In order to facilitate a streamlined noise complaints process that will help administrators of excessive noise complaints and contribute to evaluation of the noise level reduction, Traffic Safety developed a Noise Complaint Form. Traffic Safety will evaluate the data compiled through the forms and include the findings in the report.

Report Update - CR_5970 Bike Sharing Program Viability (Nov. 13, 2018 UPC) This report explores the viability of a bike share program, options for pilot programs in Edmonton, and the regulatory framework around private-sector bike shares. Administration has completed a jurisdictional review and is now looking at the operational and regulatory framework required to facilitate bike shares operations and programs operating within the City. The report will provide a summary of the jurisdictional review, outline opportunities and challenges impacting the viability of bike share in Edmonton, and identify regulatory requirements and resourcing including identifying the preferred operational model for implementation. Once direction from the Urban Planning Committee is received in November, a plan for implementation could be developed with the intention of bike share being operational in Edmonton in Q2 2019. Legal Considerations Bike share bicycles are permitted to operate in the same fashion as individually owned bicycles, however the storage of bike share bicycles on road right-of-way requires a permit under the Traffic Bylaw. The chart below outlines the legal parameters of equipment typically associated with bike share. Bicycles Electric Bicycles Electric Scooters In Roadway Right-of-Way Allowed to operate. Requires City permit to store in ROW. Allowed to operate. Requires City permit to store in ROW. Currently not allowed, as per province’s Traffic Safety Act. In Parkland Allowed Currently not allowed, as per City Parkland Bylaw. Currently not allowed, as per City Parkland Bylaw. Bike Sharing Pilot CR_5970 Bike Sharing Program Viability will identify bike share pilot program options for Council's consideration with an anticipated implementation in 2019. This approach will ensure appropriate resources are available to support the pilot program selected, that the program will meet the needs of the Edmontonian’s and its visitors, and that experience gained through the pilot program can be used for ongoing operations of bike share in Edmonton long-term. This will allow for a coordinated, objective, and data-informed initiative. Implementation of bike share in the City of Edmonton, including any pilot programs, will require Administration to develop a permit including details on operational expectations. The process of developing a permit is anticipated to take several weeks of dedicated resource time to ensure appropriate controls and mechanisms are in place. Feedback and learnings from other jurisdictions indicate that the alignment and planning of the program and the permitting process are critical to ensure a successful implementation providing a seamless customer experience considering the needs for all roadway users and modes of transportation. Lime Bike Recently, Administration received several inquiries from bike share proponents. On July 24, 2018, Administration met with Lime Bike to learn more about its operations, equipment, and experiences in other cities. Administration indicated that bicycles are allowed to operate on City lands and that we were currently in the process of researching the regulatory requirements associated with bike share operations with the intent to report back to Council in November. Bike Share in Calgary On July 23, 2018, Calgary City Council directed its administration to initiate a two-year pilot for bike share by September 2018 and provide final recommendations by Q4 2020. The City of Calgary motion also directed City of Calgary Administration to review its existing bylaws governing mobility devices such as scooters, skateboards, roller skates, and personal mobility devices with electric motors with the intent to bring forward any necessary bylaw amendments to facilitate the use of such devices in Q1 2019. We will be providing Lime Bike with clarification on the requirement for a permit and timelines associated with our current work.

This work begins with research to identify how our organization is currently perceived and where opportunities exist for enhancing understanding of who we are, the services we deliver and how we set priorities. City Council’s participation in this research is important to the success of this work. Our City brand is the perception people have based on their awareness and experience of us as an organization. Building a strong City brand is important because it enables the City to advance Council’s vision and strategic goals for Edmonton. When citizens have a positive perception of their municipal government and its programs and services, it leads to increased trust and confidence in the City. The research, conducted by an external firm, will gather insights from both internal and external audiences. It will consist of interviews, workshops and an online survey to ensure that many voices are heard. The findings will be used to build a brand strategy that aligns with Council’s vision. We would very much appreciate the opportunity to hear Council’s views. Please watch for an invitation coming soon from the Marketing branch to participate in an interview. We appreciate your continued support as we work to better understand Edmontonians’ current perceptions and collaboratively strengthen our brand.

Based on the completion of a fair, open, transparent and competitive procurement process, Proterra, a world leader in electrified mass transit based in California, was selected as the proponent to enter into a contract with the City. The City utilized a Negotiated Request for Proposal (NRFP) approach, which included a Fairness Monitor who provided an independent third-party review to ensure a fair supplier evaluation and selection process. Based on final pricing and the necessary charging and facility infrastructure that is required at the new Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage, Proterra will supply the City with a total of 25 electric buses. It is anticipated these buses will be put into regular service in summer 2020. Electric buses contribute to the City’s shift toward more sustainable transportation, a low carbon city and high-quality transit service for Edmontonians. The City’s decision to purchase electric buses is supported by recent technological improvements, a strong commitment from Edmonton City Council and federal, provincial and municipal funding ($21.5 million, $10.8 million and $10.8 million respectively). Edmonton Transit Service and Fleet and Facility Services will also be changing maintenance schedules and equipment and updating operator and fleet training. For added context about the procurement process, the City also placed additional measures in the NRFP to ensure transparency, accountability and value for money, including a: ● “No lobbying” clause to ensure the highest standard for ethical behaviour; and ● Requirement that all information requests be directed to one person in Corporate Procurement & Supply Services (CPSS) to ensure everyone had access to the same information. These measures ensured the 10-member Evaluation Committee could consider the proposals based on their technical and financial merit. The Fairness Report is attached. c.

As we are receiving many inquiries, and as some of the issues are sensitive, I felt it would be appropriate to share with your offices the processes in place regarding tax forgiveness. The vast majority of assessment and taxation processes and functions are provincially legislated. Previous to the passing of the City of Edmonton Charter earlier this year, Administration referred to City Policy C-543 Retroactive Municipal Tax Refunds and the Council-approved Tax Adjustment and Rebate Criteria when considering requests for tax cancellation from property owners. However, the enactment of the Charter has impacted Administration’s ability to independently resolve some tax cancellation requests. This has resulted in an increase of escalated calls and inquiries. At the April 5, 2018 Executive Committee and April 10, 2018 Council meetings, Administration presented report CR_5702 Requests for Tax Adjustments and Rebates. This report informed Council that Administration could no longer execute the Tax Adjustment and Rebate Criteria. As a result, requests that fall within the parameters of the criteria, including tax penalty cancellations due to death in the immediate family, must now undergo the standard Council review and decision-making process, in keeping with section 347(1) of the MGA. Administration is currently preparing a proposed policy that aims to modernize and replace the existing City Policy C-543, the now defunct Tax Adjustment and Rebate Criteria, and to address both tax forgiveness and tax exemption in a holistic manner. Administration intends to first, present the discussion paper “Property Tax Exemption and Relief” to Council. This will be followed by a report to present the proposed new policy which complies with the delegation provisions within the City Charter. Administration expects to bring these items forward to Council in late 2018 to early 2019. Until such time that a new policy is approved, Administration has no ability to independently cancel or reduce taxes and/or penalties, regardless of the value. During this interim, all requests for tax (and penalty) forgiveness, must undergo the standard Council review and decision-making process, in keeping with section 347(1) of the MGA.

A pedestrian scramble, also known as scramble intersection, exclusive pedestrian interval, or Barnes Dance, is a signalized intersection control that temporarily stops all vehicular traffic, allowing pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time. Vehicles are not permitted to make right turns when signals are red. Installing these pedestrian scrambles can impact vehicle, transit, and pedestrian travel times, but are also expected to improve pedestrian safety and convenience. The pedestrian scramble located at the intersection of Jasper Avenue and 104 Street is scheduled for September 21, 2018, weather permitting. The pedestrian scramble located at the intersection of 82 Avenue and 105 Street is scheduled for October 5, 2018, weather permitting, to accommodate for construction of a sidewalk associated with the Raymond Block mixed-use development. These intersections were selected for the pilot study because of their high pedestrian volumes, high rates of turning vehicles, and history of pedestrian-vehicle collisions. This is part of a one-year pilot project to determine if this intersection design can decrease or eliminate potential collisions between pedestrians and vehicles, aligning with the City’s Vision Zero strategy. The installation of pedestrian scrambles is consistent with Vision 2050, whereby an active, walkable neighbourhood that is accessible, more convenient, and safer encourages more people to choose active, healthy, and environmentally sustainable mobility options. Municipalities around the world have utilized scrambles to provide more equitable priority to pedestrians in areas of high pedestrian movement. Calgary has two pedestrian scrambles in the Eau Claire neighbourhood; Australia utilizes this type of traffic signal movement in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney; and Japan has more than 300 pedestrian scrambles in operation. Several internal and external stakeholders including: Edmonton Transit Service, Edmonton Police Service, Emergency Medical Services, Edmonton Fire Services, the Accessibility Advisory Committee, and CNIB are being consulted on this project. Local external stakeholders, such as businesses and business associations, will also be engaged. Street Teams will be scheduled to be at each intersection on the first day of operation to provide pedestrians direction on how the pedestrian scramble works. A public information plan will also be delivered and will communicate details on this project more broadly to Edmontonians. Administration will evaluate the effectiveness on pedestrian safety of these two scrambles by collecting and analyzing video data related to driver and pedestrian behavior before and after installation.

The Builder Licensing Program was implemented by Alberta Municipal Affairs to: reduce the risks prospective homeowners face by establishing a licensing system, providing consumers with information on builders, and creating provisions to remove or suspend builders when necessary to protect homeowners from negligent or unscrupulous businesses. With a focus on enhancing service to meet industry needs, this program helps to alleviate the pressure on resources used to address ""problem builders"". This allows administration to focus on builders in good standing. Further, this helps to reduce the amount of numbered companies which may change their name several times and are difficult to hold accountable for compliance items years after a project is complete. The program has been in effect for less than a year and all avenues have not been fully investigated. Generally, builders can retain a license if they meet the following criteria: • the licence holder is at least 18 years of age; • the licence holder is legally authorized to work in Canada; and • where the licence holder is a corporation, that the corporation is registered in Alberta. A builder can lose their licence if the builder has an offence, order or penalty through: • the Condominium Property Act; • the Fair Trading Act; • the Occupational Health and Safety Act; • the Safety Codes Act; • the Workers' Compensation Act; • involving fraud, deceit or breach of trust under any provision of an enactment of Canada or Alberta or another province; or • any provision of a similar enactment of another province or country. With this current understanding the City of Edmonton, through the Safety Codes Act and Permit Regulation, requires an applicant to have home warranty to be able to apply for a permit. However, a builder must be licensed through the Builder Licensing Program to obtain a home warranty. While this is a Provincial program and has been implemented for less than a year, the City of Edmonton is in contact with Alberta Municipal Affairs to provide support and engage with future directions of the program.

On August 27, 2018, four locations had LED display boards installed along with 85 decibel limit signs. On September 4th, 2018, Administration became aware of the misuse of the LED display equipment by some motorists. In the first few weeks of the pilot, Administration received numerous complaints about drivers revving their engines and making excessive noise in order to generate a display from the noise monitoring equipment. Two of the LED locations were disabled; one display was covered with plastic material and one displays wiring unit was vandalized. As a result of a technical and operational review of the equipment and complaints received, Administration disconnecting all the LED displays by September 12, 2018. All eight vehicle noise monitoring stations will continue to collect data as planned. The LED displays will not be reactivated during the duration of this pilot. The noise monitoring pilot continues to generate citizen interest through requests for monitoring, reporting of noisy vehicles, and other associated information. To capture this information, an online Vehicle Noise Report will be posted to the Vehicle Noise Monitoring Pilot web page. Citizens can provide information through the online form or calling 311. This data will help Administration determine how widespread the challenges are, and understand if certain characteristics such as time of day, location, type of vehicle, direction of travel, and other factors can make vehicle noise feel excessive. Updates to 311 and the webpage have been made to inform citizens of the online form, and to contact the Edmonton Police Service if they wish to make a formal noise complaint regarding motorcycles.

Administration has undertaken a comprehensive review of al l (DC1) Direct Development Control Provisions. In tota l, there are 205 DC1 Provisions that apply to 15,798 titled properties. Upon further analysis, 42 Provisions contain related commercial uses that may be suitable to add Cannabis Retail Sales. The remaining DC1 Provisions are residential. Given the complex nature of DC1 Provisions, the addition of Cannabis Reta il Sales as a use class wi ll require significant time and resources. In many instances, the DC1 Provisions are imbedded in area redevelopment plans and would require plan amendments. In other cases, the Provisions cover a large area of many blocks and property owners. Many Provisions are decades old and would require a significant effort to bring them into line with current Zoning Bylaw regulations. There are two potential approaches that can be used to add Cannabis Retai l Sales to the DC1 Provisions: developer/landowner initiated, or City initiated. 1. Developer/landowner initiated (recommended): These would be standard Land Development Applications that would requ ire the payment of established fees, notification and circu lation, and potential public engagement. Depending on the situation, the site may be rezoned to DC1 or DC2 Provision, and, where necessary and/or appropriate, plan amendments would be included. Each file would be considered by Council at a public hearing with policy, infrastructure and engagement impacts discussed. While each review may require some time, it is in line with the expectations of Direct Control Provisions that Council review amendments in a holistic manner. Typical timelines for a Direct Control Provision would be in the range of six months from application to public hearing, depending on the complexity of the file. The benefits of this approach are: it will be site-specific and only completed where the owner feels appropriate; will incorporate site-specific public involvement; will integrate into regular Planning Coordination file review. The drawbacks for applicants/owners are the costs and time involved. An application fee for a Direct Control Provision is $6,553, a minimum of $2,705 for a plan amendment, plus an additional advertising fee of $1,366 (based on the 2018 fee schedule). 2. City initiated: For a City initiated rezoning, the process would be the same as the Developer/landowner initiated Land Development Application process, except that costs would be assumed by the City. It is not recommended to attempt a blanket approach to rezoning (a comprehensive city-wide change to all DC1 Provisions, with no notification or consultation) given the complex nature of DC1 's. It is important to note that there has been no agreement from the Government of Alberta to cover any City incurred costs to prepare for the legalization of cannabis. It is estimated that there would be a need for one additional full time equivalent (FTE) Planner II position to process the 42 DC1 Provision bylaws (in approximately one year). The total cost for processing the DC1 Provisions, including an FTE, notification, advertising and engagement costs, would be approximately $230,000. This would require funding from tax levy as City-initiated changes to the Zoning Bylaw are not within scope of the revised Current Planning Reserve policy (the proposed Planning and Development Business Model will be presented to Executive Committee on October 1 ). Planning Coordination is in the process of or has reviewed 31 applications to add Cannabis Retail Sales to various sites around the city. To date, 20 Special Area Zones or Direct Control Zones have been amended to add Cannabis Retail Sales (as approved by City Council). Ten applications are currently being reviewed by Planning Coordination and no Public Hearing date has been set for these files. Given the experience to date, Administration is recommending that amending the DC1 Provisions be developer or landowner initiated. c: Executive Leadership Team Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Livia Balone, Director, Planning Coordination Attachment: List of Potential DC1 Provisions to have Cannabis Retail Sales Added as a Permitted Use",,"Yes","2018-05-29T00:00:00.000","6.6","City Council"

The Funicular will complete its 100,000th trip in the coming weeks. At peak times we have recorded as many as 135 passengers and 28 trips on the Funicular in one hour. While the site is a popular destination, there have been several incidents of vandalism. In addition to on-site cameras and inspections by staff several times a day, we are looking at innovative ideas and solutions to deter vandalism at the site. Administration is pursuing a partnership with the Startup in Residence (STIR) program. This 16-week program will look at ways to co-create technology solutions to assist with reducing vandalism issues at the site. Proposed solutions are expected in the second quarter of 2019, with implementation to follow. Administration is currently assessing monthly maintenance and operating costs based on the first year of operation. During the planning phase, annual operating and maintenance estimates ranged from 2 to 4 percent of capital costs ($450,000 to $950,000). Based on costing to date, the actual costs are close to the 4 percent projection. The Funicular has been closed for periods of time for a variety of reasons such as planned preventative maintenance, vandalism, technical operating issues and issues caused by users. Ongoing initiatives to address these issues have been implemented such as improved site signage on how to use the Funicular (it is different than an elevator) and rationale and information posted about timelines for planned maintenance. There are several operational items that Administration is working to address with the vendor, Doppelmayr. These include warranty and deficiencies items, alarm response times and security. Administration is also currently working with Doppelmayr and the Alberta Elevating Devices and Amusement Rides Association on identifying the maintenance requirements that can be safely executed outside of the scheduled operation hours. For the month of October, surveys will be conducted on-site and online to gather user input and feedback about the overall user experience. This information will be used to guide communication and education strategies going forward. Beginning in November and throughout the winter season, Administration plans to share stories of how Edmontonians and visitors are taking advantage of the Funicular and the positive impact to downtown and River Valley. An update on the results from the public engagement and STIR program will be provided to City Council through a memo in the third quarter of 2019.

Update: University Land Trust There are two primary components to activating the Land Trust. The first is to establish the Trust and the second is to transfer land assets to allow the Trust to monetize them; in this case only to lease and not to sell them. The Land Trust was established by Ministerial Order in February 2015 and the University has since proposed a number of properties be transferred to the Trust. To date, the University has yet to be provided approval by the Provincial Government on a proposed mix of assets to be transferred to the Trust. In the meantime, the University continues to dialogue with the Province to understand the reasons for the delay. At this time the University cannot provide an estimate as to when the Province will provide formal approval on the transfer of assets to the Trust. Update: Stakeholder Engagement Plans for the City of Edmonton, the University of Alberta, the Government of Alberta, and adjacent communities City Administration, through the External Relations Branch, meets with the University of Alberta on a regular basis. Through these meetings the City receives information from the University of Alberta as it pertains to South Campus. The City has also been invited to the public engagement sessions that Alberta Health Services is leading with community members. In addition, throughout the last few months, the City has met with representatives of both parties to gain an understanding of their development plans and their ongoing outreach to adjacent communities* as the proposed developments are under review and design. All parties have agreed to maintain this ongoing dialogue and to provide periodic updates to each other. Administration will also attend future public engagement sessions as a citizen resource and continue to share the City's goals and aspirations for this transit node. The next formal Public Engagement session is tentatively scheduled for October, 2018 and City Planning representatives will attend to better understand how the surrounding communities are responding to the plans and to answer questions related to broader community impacts and future developments on issues of City jurisdiction. The build out of the University's lands at the South Campus continues to be part of a long term plan for the area that envisions higher density development. The University has advised that it is reviewing strategies and partnerships for the lands adjacent to the South Campus LRT Station with continued plans to develop the site for student housing. In the interim, a surface parking lot is contemplated to serve the Provincial Lab Hub and sports facility users. *Adjacent communities are presented by the South Campus Neighbourhood Coalition, including Aspen Gardens, Grandview, Landsdowne, Lendrum, Parkallen, Malmo Plains, Belgravia, McKernan, and the University of Alberta. c: Executive Leadership Team Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk",,"Yes","2018-06-12T00:00:00.000","6.12","City Council"

Today, Administration responded to the comprehensive list of questions submitted by the Chamber of Commerce and Prosperity Edmonton. In an effort to remain open and transparent, the Executive Leadership Team felt our answers should be shared with all Edmontonians. We have posted the full text of the Chamber’s questions on the City of Edmonton website. Our answers include a narrative that helps Edmontonians understand the context for our budget work. We have also developed a new yegcitybudget site that includes some of the Chamber’s questions and provides a platform for two-way dialogue with all Edmontonians. We invite Edmontonians to ask questions and be a part of the conversation around the Budget. This kind of engagement reinforces our corporate culture. As well today, I launched the first of a series of videos for City of Edmonton employees called “To the Point.” These videos aim to inform our staff about the Budget, engage them in the process and connect with them in a new and accessible format. We have also developed a new email address, tothepoint@edmonton.ca , for employees to submit questions about the Budget. I will answer their questions in future videos. We have developed a comprehensive Q&A document to help Branch Managers and their teams answer some of the more direct questions from staff. We want City of Edmonton employees to be as informed as possible so they can continue to focus on the great work they do every day in service to Edmontonians.

Prior to LRT construction, a series of Bylaws will be brought to Executive Committee where property owners will have the ability to register to speak prior to Council readings. According to current plans, approximately 190 accesses will be impacted in the following categories: ● Closures where an alternate access to the property exists; ● Closures which may have an impact to the property; ● Access modifications and/or changing to right in, right out only; ● Access requiring closures, modifications or changes that are part of land acquisition. For those accesses that will be permanently closed, those closures will happen in accordance with the Highways Development and Protection Act (“ HDPA ”). The HDPA is the statute that provides the general authority and process for the City to close accesses. The HDPA also contains provisions on when compensation, if any, is payable by the City to an affected property owner. Administration’s intent is to provide the affected property owners with notice in advance of the Bylaw readings. In addition to properties where Administration has already engaged the public through various means, the intention in 2018 is to notify all property owners where an access closure, modification or change is required. Dependant on project timelines, the Bylaws will then proceed to Committee and Council in the fall of 2019 with physical closure of the accesses prior to construction initiation in the area of the closure. LRT Delivery, in conjunction with the City’s Real Estate Branch, is preparing to send general notices to affected property owners, which will include a drawing of their particular access(es) where a closure is required. The letter reinforces its purpose of providing initial notification, a direct contact to LRT Delivery, and that physical closure of the access is not required immediately but will be required as part of the Valley Line West project. General notification letters will begin to be sent the week of October 9, 2018 and will be staged in separate batches to ensure the volume of potential responses can be managed effectively. LRT Delivery is committed to ongoing communication with affected property owners throughout this process as additional information becomes available.

Citizens can share their perspectives on whether the final draft bus network redesign captures the spirit of their feedback from earlier engagement activities. This past spring, more than 2,300 Edmontonians attended drop-in workshops and participated in stakeholder engagement activities. The City also received 4,200 completed online surveys. Some feedback highlights included: ● General satisfaction with straighter bus routes, new crosstown routes and frequent routes, increased service frequency including more evening and weekend service ● Community-specific concerns about the loss of some service in some neighbourhoods ● General concern about increased walking distance, especially from seniors and those with mobility challenges ● Some residents are worried about suitable pedestrian infrastructure, including winter maintenance, overall condition and missing sidewalk connections on some proposed bus routes What We Did and Heard Report summary and a complete report of spring engagement results will be posted online October 5 at edmonton.ca/newbusroutes .

The U of G has been conducting food waste research with the City of Guelph for several years. This year, the researchers received a grant and invited the City of Edmonton to participate in the project. Wasted food is a growing concern in Canada, with economic, environmental and social repercussions. Consumers are responsible for 47 percent of Canada’s food waste. This study will be used to help Waste Services develop food waste prevention programs for Edmonton residents. A total of four neighbourhoods (Athlone, Bellevue, Greenview, and McLeod) have been selected to participate in the project. For a three week period beginning October 23rd, garbage and recycling from 200 households in each of the four neighbourhoods will be collected by City staff, sorted, and weighed by U of G researchers (in coordination with City staff) at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre, to measure volumes of household food waste. All garbage and recycling will be picked up by Waste Services staff on residents’ regular collection days. Collection may take place at a slightly different time of day than usual, and residents may notice the CIty using slightly different vehicles from the garbage trucks they are used to seeing. Households that are selected for this project do not need to do anything differently during the research period. No personal information will be collected from these households or individuals, in accordance with FOIP policy. All selected households will receive a letter informing them of the study. The letter will provide households with instructions on how to opt-out of the project if they wish. An FAQ document is attached to this memo.

At that meeting, Administration committed to provide Councillors with an update once the project had developed sufficiently. The project design elements include a set of wooden stairs, a gravel trail, custom railings, plant material and one lamp post along Saskatchewan Drive. The scope of work also includes truncation of existing exposed concrete piles. A public engagement plan has been implemented and the Belgravia Community League sub-committee has been an active participant in the development of the project. This work is funded through the River Valley Trail and Park Renewal Composite Profile (CM-28-8530) and the current approved budget is $1,501,532. The work will be carried out through the balance of 2018 and the viewpoint is anticipated to be open to the public prior to the end of 2018. Some aspects of the work will require completion in Q2 2019 due to seasonal limitations but are not expected to impact utilization of the site. The project is currently in the build phase and the construction contract has been awarded to Alberco Construction Ltd. Mobilization is scheduled to commence on October 22, 2018 starting with installation of construction fencing to secure the site during construction. Construction of the stairs, railings, truncation of exposed concrete piles and slope stabilization is anticipated to take 8 weeks, weather permitting. The remaining work, landscaping and granular trail, will be completed in Q2 2019. To ensure a successful project implementation, the project team has completed extensive work related to project communications including updates to the project website, development of 311 scripting and preparation of a communication strategy which includes media relations. The contractor has been an active participant in the communications strategy, through planning for site mobilization and in understanding how to address feedback from the public during the performance of the work. Both public and media inquiries will be addressed by the project team which includes an Integrated Infrastructure Services Communications Advisor. A media availability has been scheduled for Noon, Monday, October 22 at Saskatchewan Drive, between 74 Avenue and 76 Avenue, to announce the start of construction.

As you know, the Bus Network Redesign project is a multi-year initiative to increase the effectiveness of how Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) moves residents around the city. Potential bus route changes include streamlined bus routes, faster cross-town trips, frequent service along main routes, rapid bus routes to connect areas with no LRT, more direct local routes, as well as effective integration with other modes of travel. It is important to note: no service hours have been lost and the majority of locations are within a 5-7 minute walk of the nearest bus stop. The Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 569 has placed television advertising expressing their concern about bus stops located further than two blocks from residences. These ads began running in early October, before the final draft network maps with adjusted walking distance were shared publicly on October 12. Preliminary indications are Edmontonians support many of the changes, such as more frequent and direct routes. Based on feedback received during public consultation this Spring, ETS made adjustments to approximately 20 percent of the routes to produce the final draft network. For example, some route locations and walking distances were modified. As per the October 10 memo, public engagement on this final draft network will run October 25 to December 9, 2018. This public feedback will be provided to City Council to help in making an informed decision on the final bus network plan in early 2019. We are also continuing research about First Kilometre/Last Kilometre options for communities that do not meet the standard for regular bus service.

Data from officer reports to date indicates strong compliance with the bylaw across the City, including: ● Citywide - 82% compliance ● Vehicle for Hire - 82% compliance ● Transit - 80 - 82% compliance ● Businesses - 97% compliance Administration has heard citizen requests for City support from those exempt from the bylaw. Communications and Engagement is creating buttons and cards that people may use to show their exemption from the bylaw. To expedite the program as quickly as possible, it is being rolled out in phases. Cards will be provided to Recreation Centres and other City facilities with front counter service for distribution to the public over the weekend. By next week there will also be an online form people may use to order cards via mail. Buttons will take longer to produce but we anticipate delivery next week. Details of the program will be provided on edmonton.ca/masks when the initial inventory of cards are available to the public for pick up. Administration is reviewing and answering concerns raised through 311 and via the mask feedback email. We have received a number of questions from restaurant owners and we will be developing new communications materials specifically designed to address their questions and concerns. EPL ON THE SQUARE: Today Edmonton Public Library officially announced the launch of the EPL on the Square pilot in cooperation with the City of Edmonton.

City of Edmonton Position: Edmonton Transit Service has made contingency service arrangements, but it means a significant disruption to morning travel. Key Messages: ● Having 40% of our LRT cars unavailable is a significant service disruption, and we apologize to travellers for this inconvenience. ● We are providing contingency service to ensure that people safely get where they need to go. ○ Metro Line has bus service, and the Capital Line has extra buses from Southgate to University. ○ Staff are on platforms directing passengers to the bus stops. ● This is an unprecedented level of damage to our cars, and we are investigating the cause. We will return the cars into service as soon as they are repaired and it is safe to do so. ● EPCOR’s catenary inspection team worked overnight on the lines to ensure that the system is safe. They have confirmed that the overhead catenary system is safe. We appreciate their efforts. Approach : Staff are at LRT stations to direct people to alternate service. Notices have been posted on social media. Background: Last night there was a routine bi-weekly inspection of the LRT’s pantograph system (the overhead connectors to the power line) conducted as trains were coming off the line into DL MacDonald garage. It was noticed that there was damage to pantographs on some trains. Upon review there were a number of cars with damaged pantographs that could not be put back into service without repairs. By the end of the inspection forty cars had been grounded. This means that around 40% of our fleet is unuseable. Metro Line service will not be maintained today and will be replaced by contingency bus service. Service on Capital Line from South Campus will be seven to eight minute frequency and augmented with contingency bus service to help the loads. Typically, Capital Line runs about 50 cars per hour, and this morning will be running 30 cars. We are yet unsure what has caused the damage. The EPCOR catenary inspection crew worked through the night to try to identify the point of contact. The line was confirmed safe this morning. Media coverage: No media coverage yet.

Projected Service Demand: To estimate DATS service demand increases, Administration referred to trip request trends, population growth estimates, demographic changes (aging population) and potential mitigating factors (such as eligibility recertification program). The average trip volume growth between 2014-2017 was 1.15 per cent. In 2018, DATS service demands have increased due to lowered fares. As such, Administration applied a low and high trip volume growth range while also considering population, demographic, and geographical growth in order to anticipate demand over the next budget cycle (2019-2022). The average service growth estimated per year is 1.66 per cent, which equates to an anticipated increase of over 90,000 additional annual trips by year 2022. Therefore, based on estimated growth and existing resources, it is anticipated that a decrease in the number of trips and clients DATS can accommodate will occur. See Attachment 1 - Projected Service Demand for a chart summarizing these findings. Population Demographics: The committee motion also included correlating increased service demand to population demographics. Currently, DATS provides service to youth under 18 (less than 1 per cent and supplemented by other options available in the community), adults 18-64 (48 per cent) , seniors 65-79 (27 per cent) and elderly clients over 80 years old (25 per cent). Most of the growth stems primarily from ambulatory clients, which is a client who is able to walk with or without a mobility aid. A summary of active DATS clients is provided in Attachment 2, which distinguishes the demand between ambulatory and wheelchair clients. Given the demographic demand, a notable portion of the requests for DATS service could be tempered by exploring additional contracted services for ambulatory clients. Administration is presenting a service package related to these options as part of the 2019-22 budget process.

This memo provides information to help you to respond. Background Site supervisors and inspectors monitored conditions as precipitation began as rain last night and slowly turned to snow in the early hours of the morning. When snow and ice started to accumulate (at approximately 3:00 am), crews were dispatched. Prior to the morning rush hour, 38 trucks and plows were deployed as well as sidewalk plows, brooms, and front end loaders. Bridge decks and on-off ramps were prioritized, followed by the river valley, major arterials, the business improvement areas, and all other priority networks. We applied salt at intersections overnight to address the ice building on the roads. We did not perform anti-icing prior to snowfall, as the conditions were too wet. By noon, there were 54 plows and trucks on the road. There was a slight delay in clearing bike lanes, as some of the metal guard posts that surround bike lanes prevented crews from optimizing equipment. However, after finding a solution to this challenge, bike lanes are now being cleared. Current State Snowfall is anticipated to continue throughout the day to a maximum of 5 cm. Staff will continue to monitor conditions, and by the time citizens begin their commute home, over 70 plows and trucks with crews will be at work on the roads to ensure drivers get home safely. It is predicted to warm up to above-zero temperatures over the weekend with potential of freezing rain on Sunday. We will continue to address icy conditions with salt or calcium chloride as needed. Salt is the best tool for these conditions, because it will dissolve into the ice, melting on contact and lowering the freezing temperature of water to -12 degrees Celsius. We do not foresee a parking ban to be needed, as snow is anticipated to melt over the weekend. Public communication Information was released to media at a noon event, and interviews are occurring throughout the afternoon. Information will continue to be provided via social media and on City of Edmonton web pages to address the changing conditions and Vision Zero safety messages. Separately, the Edmonton Police Service has released information about traffic safety and collision statistics. Additional information will be provided next week about the City’s overall plan for winter service. Safe winter travel requires drivers to adjust to ever-changing conditions and for all travellers to be cautious. As you have the opportunity to communicate to citizens in person and through social media, we encourage you to join us in sharing the following messages. ● Please drive to the conditions of the road and to levels of visibility ● Check your tire tread, air pressure, and consider changing to winter tires ● Check your windshield wiper fluid and anti-freeze levels ● Continue to watch closely for pedestrians ● Leave plenty of room between vehicles to adjust to slippery conditions ● Ensure your windshields and windows are clear of snow or ice ● Pick up free sand at a community sandbox We also encourage pedestrians and cyclists to take special care in travelling. ● Pay close attention to surroundings and observe traffic ● Be more visible by wearing bright clothing or reflective gear ● Anticipate icy conditions and wear appropriate footwear and clothing Edmonton is a winter city and we have a robust program in place to ensure we apply the best solutions in a changing climate, and deliver services to the standard Edmontonians expect. By working together, the City of Edmonton and our citizens can help ensure safe conditions and mobility for everyone - on our roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks.

The Enterprise Land Development (ELD) program’s projects involve constructing infrastructure related to the development of greenfield land into fully serviced subdivisions. Development projects often include off-site work that benefits the larger neighbourhood such as removing prohibitive barriers and entering into partnerships with other developers to support further growth of neighbourhoods. The program is able to engage in these activities by drawing on the revenue generated from land development activities and therefore does not draw from the city’s tax base. Land development activities led by ELD expand the city’s road and utility network, promote sustainable built forms, contribute to affordable housing initiatives, add to the city’s open spaces and natural areas and improve climate resilience. These activities produce a wide range of housing and business options while creating a diverse range of local amenities, generating positive economic impacts and encouraging active, healthy lifestyles for citizens. The program also provides tangible benefits to the City through its land development activities including the creation of residential, commercial and industrial lots, creating opportunities for business, and offsetting operation costs through an annual dividend. The work of the Enterprise Land Development program: Promotes sustainable built forms ELD promotes sustainability by requiring buyers of commercial and industrial lots to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certification in their built form. It also requires buyers of residential lots to construct in accordance with Natural Resources Canada specifications and achieve prescribed minimum EnerGuide ratings; residential buyers in Laurel Green were required to ensure homes were constructed as solar-ready. 94 percent of the single-family residential homes constructed in the Oxford and Laurel Green neighbourhoods were able to meet or exceed the EnerGuide target rating. Adds to the city’s open space and natural areas Through development activities, the program adds to the city’s open space and retains natural areas. The program has dedicated a total of over 69 ha of land as municipal reserve, environmental reserve, natural area and Stormwater Management Facilities (SWMF) and, at times, has provided larger amounts of land than required by the Municipal Government Act . Recent examples of providing larger amounts include the park/school site in the recently developed Oxford neighbourhood and the open spaces as part of the ELD project in the Schonsee neighbourhood. Improves the city’s resilience to major storm events ELD has improved the city’s climate resilience through the development of SWMF. Within the past 10 years, the City constructed and dedicated 44 ha of SWMF ensuring that the surrounding communities are protected from flooding during storm events up to, and in some cases exceeding, the 1 in 100 year major storm event standard. Contributes to affordable housing initiatives ELD contributes to affordable housing initiatives by ensuring there is a residential lot supply available for affordable housing developments, specifically: ● Developing a multi-family site in Laurel Green, chosen as the location of the Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project to commemorate Canada’s 150th anniversary. On this site, Habitat for Humanity is building 58 affordable housing homes and catalyzed both a provincial contribution and the sweat equity donated by the Carter project; ● Policy C511 directs that City’s development of residential lots should be benchmarked at 10% below CMHC average lot prices; ● Facilitating homes with secondary suites built on City developed lands in Oxford and Legacy Pointe in La Perle. Increases the city’s tax base and offset corporate operational costs The program’s last three industrial commercial projects in Rampart and Place La Rue generated in excess of $1.4 million in annual non-residential property taxes (2018 rate). Previously, ELD also initiated the Pylypow industrial development, which invested in excess of $20 million in capital infrastructure. This included developing 35 industrial lots, generating $33 million in gross profit and providing ongoing non-residential tax revenue. In 2018, non-resi","ial tax revenue. In 2018, non-residential property taxes from the Pylypow development are expected to be over $4 million. In the past 10 years, the Enterprise has generated in excess of $50 million for the City by way of dividends. Since 2005, with respect to non-municipal purpose land development activities, ELD has paid an average annual dividend of over $2.7 million to the City to supplement tax levy obligations. ELD also continues the contributions of its predecessor, Millwoods Enterprise, having funded: ● $60+ million of city building projects including contributions to the purchase of Century Place and Chancery Hall, and partial construction funding for City Hall and the Convention Centre projects; ● Millwoods second mortgage program ; ● City debt reduction (e.g. 1992-1996 debt reduction of $34.6 million); ● Interim capital and/or land purchases for future municipal purposes and prepaid local improvements; and ● Money or in-kind donations to non-profit organizations. Provides opportunities for business ELD sells 50 percent of its single detached residential lots to individuals and small home builders; not only providing opportunities for small business owners and citizens but also improving the lives of Edmontonians by supporting affordability of housing and providing choice in the market. ELD supports business by ensuring a reasonable supply of serviced industrial and commercial land is available for sale and vertical built form opportunities. Examples of specific business opportunities created by ELD activities include: ● Developed lands in the Rampart Business Park to attract investment from the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan. At full build-out, this site will provide over 745,000 square feet of industrial built space; ● The recent sale of a multi-family site in the Schonsee neighbourhood through a public proposal process enabled an experienced multi-family home builder to complete their first land development project in the City of Edmonton. During the 2019-2022 budget cycle, ELD plans to service approximately 71 acres of industrial land in the areas of Rampart and Southeast Industrial, creating another 38 industrial lots. The timing of the sale and development of these lots will depend on market absorption. Catalyzes private development ELD contributes to the private development industry by front-ending the cost of expensive infrastructure, thus removing barriers and catalyzing neighbourhood development. Since 2011, ELD has contributed approximately $50 million to neighbourhood catalyzation. This includes: ● The construction of the Schonsee Wetland, which benefitted a total basin area of 139 ha constructed on City land, meant that other developers in the area did not have incur costs to construct their own on-site SWMF; ● Participation in the 167 Avenue NW Palisades Owners Group (POG) in which ELD contributed to construction of two SWMF’s, as well as off-site storm and sanitary sewers. As a member of the POG, ELD was also a major contributor to the construction of 167 Avenue from 127 st to the TUC; ● The construction of a portion of 51 Avenue NW assisted in the development of private sector industrial land; ● Completing a Neighbourhood Design Report (NDR) for a portion of the Ellerslie Basin benefitting multiple land owners, and allowing for development by the private sector; and ● Entering into a joint venture agreement with a neighbouring developer for the Laurel Green subdivision; allowing them to accelerate their development timelines for their land while simultaneously allowing development of City lands and generating revenue for the City. Improves the lives of Edmontonians The City’s land development activities improve the lives of Edmontonians in many of the ways outlined above, as well as promoting and leading City building initiatives, including: ● Securing a consolidated parcel for the construction of The Meadows Community Recreation Centre; ● Providing development expertise to projects across the City, assisting with the initiation of City transformational projects at the concept stage including The Quarters, Station Pointe, Rossdale and Blatchford. This development expertise has also extended to municipal projects such as site servicing for fire halls, transit centers, integrated municipal operations (Ambleside & Poundmaker), and servicing land for municipal entities such as EPCOR. Builds City Infrastructure ELD has contributed approximately $50 million in the form of front-end construction costs in the last 10 years for various City building initiatives including: ● Constructing a portion of 91 Street NW/Ewing trail to help facilitate the completion of 91 Street NW; allowing it to become a major connection to the Queen Elizabeth II Highway and 41 Avenue SW interchange project. This project also allowed for the installation of a portion of the South Edmonton Sanitary Sewer. ● Accelerating the development of Goodridge Stage 1 to facilitate the construction of the Edmonton Police Service Northwest Campus and the Co-located Dispatch and Emergency Operations Center. ELD’s role as a land developer provides an alternate revenue stream for the City of Edmonton, paying a dividend to the corporation, offsetting operational costs and achieving other ancillary outcomes. ELD promotes sustainable built forms, improves the city’s climate resilience, contributes to affordable housing initiatives, increases the city’s tax base, provides opportunities for business, catalyzes neighbourhood development and directly improves the lives of Edmontonians.

This security enhancement is part of our ongoing commitment to keep citizens and transit staff safe. Phased in over two weeks, a third party contractor will deploy security guards at 25 transit centres/stations that have had at least one major incident reported in the past five years. At selected transit centres, security guards will be deployed 24/7. At selected LRT stations, security guards will be assigned to that particular location for the majority of their shift, but will transition to another facility when these LRT stations close at night. For a full list of the 25 transit centres/stations that will have security guards, out of 43 total, please see the Attachment. Security guards will wear highly visible jackets or vests (not ETS branded), have appropriate communication devices in order to call ETS Control or emergency services directly and spend the entirety of their shift patrolling an assigned transit centre/station (with transitions to other facilities when LRT stations close at night). Security guards will be highly integrated with existing security personnel including Transit Peace Officers and the Edmonton Police Service. Security guards will receive appropriate orientation, training and operational knowledge to effectively patrol their assigned location. The security guard's primary responsibilities while assigned to ETS properties are high public visibility, being available to customers and the safety and security of the facility and City of Edmonton assets. These responsibilities will be achieved through patrolling all areas of the transit centre/station, as well as a high level of public interaction. A public education campaign is being developed to reflect the role of the security guards in order to manage public expectations. If the security guard witnesses any nuisance, disorder or criminal activity, they will document the details and report the incident (through assigned communication devices) to the appropriate response service. ETS will be issuing a public service announcement Thursday, November 8, 2018.

The 2018 Grey Cup is a major event that brings significant profile to Edmonton. It offers Edmontonians - and people from across Canada - the opportunity to take part in one of the nation’s oldest and largest sporting events. Grey Cup Festival Impacts A significant part of Grey Cup is the Grey Cup Festival that will take place in downtown Edmonton from November 21 to 24. This year access to Churchill Square is limited due to construction projects, so the festival organizers requested that the City close a portion of Jasper Avenue in order to host the festival. Recognizing how important the festival is to the overall event, Administration agreed to the request in order to ensure a successful festival and provide the space required for the planned activation. The festival allows all citizens to be part of the excitement of the Grey Cup. Hosting the festival on Jasper Avenue will create some challenging travel conditions for motorists and transit users. During the week of November 12, Administration will increase communications to Edmontonians about the festival related road closures. Road closures will take place as follows from November 14 to 28 (this includes set up and tear down): ● Jasper Avenue from 96 Street to 99 Street ● 97 Street north from Jasper Avenue to 101A Avenue Access to off-street parking facilities in this area will be maintained during this time. Grey Cup Parade Impacts In addition to road closures for the festival, there will also be closures for the Grey Cup Parade, which has joined forces with Santa’s Parade of Lights, on November 24. Assembly and Dispersal Area 6:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.: The area north of Jasper Avenue and south of 104 Avenue, from 105 Street to 108 Street, will be closed to vehicles. Access to off-street parking facilities in this area will be maintained via 106 Street and 107 Street until 8:30 a.m. Parade Route 10:15 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.: To accommodate the parade route, the following roads will be closed to vehicles: ● Jasper Avenue from 109 Street to 100 Street ● 101 Street from Jasper Avenue to 102A Avenue ● 103 Avenue from 101 St to 103 Street Street parking will not be permitted in the affected areas. Vehicle tag and tow operations will be in effect. Game Day Impacts Commonwealth Stadium and Recreation Centre In order to host the Grey Cup game at Commonwealth Stadium on November 25, there will be impacts to Commonwealth Community Recreation Centre and to roadways around the stadium. The recreation centre will be closed to the public on November 24 and 25 to allow for the facility to be used to support the needs of Grey Cup including events on game day. Information will be provided to customers of the facility the week of November 5. Facility users will be referred to other recreation centres such as Clareview Community Recreation Centre, Kinsmen Sports Centre, and Londonderry Leisure Centre. Road Closures On game day, November 25, the parking lots at the stadium and recreation centre will be closed. Stadium Road will be closed to all vehicle traffic beginning at 11 a.m. and will reopen at approximately 11 p.m. Other road closures may be implemented on November 25. More information will be available online at edmonton.ca/specialeventroadclosures. Fans will be encouraged to take public transit to the stadium. Residential parking restrictions will be in effect in the neighbourhoods around the stadium. Information on game day road closures will be shared with the public the week of November 12.

This is not the case. Citizens continue to have a grace period of 48 hours after the end of a snowfall to clear sidewalks adjacent to their property of snow and ice. It is important to note that this is a City guideline, it is not written into the bylaw itself. Enforcement • Ideally, property owners should remove snow and ice as soon as possible, especially during days of continuous snowfall. As a general rule though, citizens have a grace period of 48 hours before they could face a warning or ticket under the Community Standards Bylaw 14600. • There are circumstances where investigations may occur before this grace period has ended. This includes: o High traffic areas around commercial businesses and at locations of reported slip and falls. The intention is to gain compliance by informing property owners through verbal and written warnings prior to escalating enforcement. o During freeze/thaw cycles and days of continuous snowfall, officers will encourage property owners to become compliant to ensure the safety and free movement of citizens using the sidewalk. • Enforcement officers are reasonable in their enforcement approach, and, as always, citizens have the right to appeal their ticket in court. • Sidewalks that the City is responsible for clearing are held to the same standard as residential sidewalks. Enforcement action and clean up of City sidewalks does occur and costs are attributed back to the department responsible. We encourage citizens to call 31 1 to report that a City sidewalk has not been cleared. The most important message that we want to get across to Edmontonians is that clearing their sidewalks helps their neighbours stay safe. • Slippery sidewalks are a risk for anyone who goes outdoors in the winter and especially for people with limited mobility, the elderly, children, and people who deliver services in our city. • As residents of a winter city, we need to be considerate of the impact snowy and icy sidewalks have on our neighbours and fellow citizens. • If you are unable to clear your sidewalks right away, we encourage you to use sand available at many community sandboxes.

Weather permitting, pedestrian scramble pavement markings will be installed at the intersections of 104 Avenue and 104 Street and 104 Avenue and 102 Street, between November 12 and November 14, 2018. A third pedestrian scramble will be installed at 103 Avenue and 103 Street in approximately two weeks. Pedestrian scramble intersections at these locations align with the overall pattern of pedestrians during events at Rogers Place, and is consistent with making the area pedestrian friendly. Temporary pedestrian scrambles are already implemented by the Edmonton Police Service to manage large pedestrian traffic during sports and entertainment events at Rogers Place. Internal and external stakeholders including Edmonton Transit Service, Edmonton Police Service, Emergency Medical Services, Edmonton Fire Services, the Accessibility Advisory Committee, and CNIB continue to be consulted on this project. Administration is working with Rogers Place to ensure the pedestrian scrambles integrate with the overall event management plan. Local external stakeholders, such as City Centre Mall, Bell Tower, Edmonton Tower, the Downtown Business Association, and local business will be notified of these changes. The Edmonton Police Service will continue to offer onsite support at these intersections during major events. A public information plan will also be delivered and will communicate details on this project more broadly to Edmontonians, including a public service announcement and information on edmonton.ca. Please note that weather is contingent for installation. If weather conditions for the week of November. 12 are not favourable, the next opportunity to install the pedestrian scrambles will be in the spring of 2019.

Calgary City Council will factor the plebiscite results into its plans to go forward with efforts to wind down the bid and the working groups/committees/bid corporation. This act of community engagement has generated significant emotion, and rekindled the passion that Calgarians feel for the opportunity to be a global winter sports leader. While the plebiscite is considered non-binding on the City, the provincial government has tied its financial support to Calgarians’ support for the bid. City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton applauds Calgary’s efforts to explore the Olympics 2026 opportunity for the benefit of their residents and all Albertans. Calgarians have voiced their opposition for continuing work on the bid. It is now up to Calgary City Council to determine the steps for suspending work. At Council’s direction, City of Edmonton Administration has focused its efforts on its role as a candidate host city in the United Bid for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Administration is currently developing the business case and the request for financial support, to be submitted to the Province of Alberta following the provincial election in spring 2019. Key Messages: ● We acknowledge the efforts of Calgary’ City Council and the Bid Committee to make this a community-wide conversation, and the engagement of so many Calgarians in their city’s future. ● In Edmonton, we remain focused on our efforts to be named a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. We are working with our community to grow support and secure provincial funding. ● Mega sporting events have the power to inspire people to move more, to achieve more, and to show their loyalty to their home town. These are the values consistent with Edmonton’s Live Active strategy. Edmonton’s business case for hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup will address both inspiration and legacy opportunities. Approach : Communications will respond to media inquiries. Background: The City of Calgary announced unofficial results: 304,774 ballots cast; 132,832 FOR Calgary hosting (43.6%), and 171,750 AGAINST Calgary hosting (56.4%). Media coverage: Local, regional and national coverage of events leading up to the plebiscite has been extensive.

Much of the project related activity has occurred in Millwoods and the area is one of the highest impacted in the City. Several significant projects continue, or have been completed to address flooding as a result of severe weather events. The construction of dry ponds in existing open spaces has been a key mitigation to localized flooding. However, this mitigation comes with trade-offs as a number of sports related amenities were displaced to accommodate the dry ponds. While dry ponds do allow for passive activities, such as soccer pitches and baseball diamonds, their placement does reduce available open space, and typically not all of the formerly existing amenities can be reinstated. Dry pond construction in Ward 11 had the following amenity impacts: ● Malcolm Tweddle – Net reduction: 2 diamonds, 3 rectangular fields, 2 tennis courts ● Tawa – Net reduction: 1 baseball diamond; and ● Ekota – Net reduction: 2 soccer fields (small) Additions include: ● Malcolm Tweddle - potential upgraded paths and toboggan hill ● Tawa - natural areas, path and benches; and ● Ekota - an amphitheater, concrete trail, and concrete pad with picnic tables Attachment 1 contains a summary of the net reductions and additions. In planning for recreation facilities the City has declared a basic commitment to residents to provide access to community and recreation facilities with a mix of recreation opportunities. This commitment is directly reflected through the City’s investment in these facilities and is aligned with its partners and others within the region. This basic commitment is outlined as follows: ● Every resident will have a place to participate in recreation indoors (including ice, water, and dry land) within 5 kilometers of their residence. ● Every resident will have a place to participate in recreation outdoors within 400 metres of their residence. The City has completed mapping to show that nearly every area inside Anthony Henday Drive meets this minimum requirement. While this high level commitment may work for the city as a whole, it does not address neighborhood level circumstances. A consideration in meeting this commitment at the local level is the utilization of facilities (demand vs. capacity). If the utilization of an amenity is low and the use can be accomodated in nearby sites then the reduction has less impact. To this end Administration examined the booking hours (demand) for each sport field within the affected area. The booking data show the annual hours a facility was to be in use. Facilities are offered from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., Monday to Friday and 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. This accounts for 40 hours of bookable time per week (capacity) . Review of the bookings records also indicates the upper limits of hours a typical facility has been booked. Some ball diamonds have been booked for over 600 hours per year. Using a combination of upper limits and 40 hours a week maximum, a capacity of 500 hours per year can be used. Tables 1, 2 and 3 indicate the utilization of facilities at Malcolm Tweddle/Edith Rogers, Tawa and Ekota as per the booking records, reflecting the annual average hours from 2010-2017. The data suggest a low demand as compared to capacity and also indicate that there are nearby facilities that could accommodate the demand. Table 1 Malcolm Tweddle / Edith Rogers Amenity Annual Hours booked (hrs) (May to September) Utilization (%) Nearby Facility utilization (%) Diamond 1 190 40% Michaels Park 5 diamonds <10% Lee Ridge 1 diamond - 30% Diamond 2* 22 <10% Diamond 3* 170 40% 2 Soccer 1* 15 <10% Michaels Park 5 soccer - 25% Lee Ridge 1 soccer <10% Soccer 2* 20 <10% Soccer 3* 6 <10% Soccer 4^ 97 20% Soccer 5 247 50% * removed due to dry pond construction ^ replaced with larger facility Tennis courts are drop in only, no bookings accepted, therefore there is no booking data for tennis court demand.

Communications and Engagement with Stakeholders in Ward 11 The process to rationalize impacted amenities was informed by communications and engagement with stakeholders and the public at large over three phases. The first phase communicated that a dry pond would be located in the area and solicited input about replacement amenities. The second phase engaged and requested feedback on options for replacement amenities after a preliminary design of the dry pond was complete. The third phase presented the dry pond design and replacement amenities, informed in part, by community input. Attachment 1 provides a summary of communications and engagement that occurred to support this work. Mitigation of Amenity Losses Past and Future Regulations for utility expenditures do not allow the drainage utility to fund the retroactive replacement of amenities after a dry pond has been constructed even though the reduction in amenities was caused by the placement of a dry pond. Replacement of amenities could potentially be funded by EPCOR in the future providing they are identified at the time the location of the dry pond is approved, are included in the permit to construct, and are installed at the time the dry pond is constructed. Administration will continue to review the potential for funding future replacement amenities with EPCOR. With City Council's approval of Breathe (Edmonton's Green Network Strategy), the City will shift from a localized approach to service and amenity provision to a network approach whereby services and amenities may be provided through a larger inventory of open space. This approach will require a holistic assessment of the demand and supply of open space and amenities for service delivery and in turn inform the prioritization and placement of civic uses with a range of public policy objectives.

In response, DATS implemented a new “Scooter Transfer Policy” by mid-2017 asking able-bodied clients to transfer from their scooter to a seat while riding in DATS vehicles or find equipment that can be secured while in transit, such as a motorized wheelchair. Over the past year-and-a-half, DATS team members have worked with over 100 clients to help them find new equipment, or have clients transfer to a seat for all of their trips. Almost all have complied; however, we continue to work with the remaining clients to ensure compliance by January 31, 2019. The remaining clients may contact your office expressing their concerns with this change. As mentioned, these changes are required in order to comply with provincial and federal safety legislation.

This updated Appendix C incorporates an additional five projects that were identified as part of the City Council Questions on the Proposed 2019-22 Capital Budget. In addition to this updated Appendix C, Administration is also providing CIty Council, via this memo, high-level cost estimates for the growth projects that are recommended for unconstrained funding, as well as the growth projects that are referenced in the updated Appendix C: Unfunded Projects . This information is being provided in order to assist City Council’s decision making for the 2019-2022 Capital Budget. Please note that the high level cost estimates are presented as a cost range (+XX%/-YY %) based on the current project checkpoint, and are variable dependant on the current project maturity as outlined in the Project Develop / Delivery Process in the Capital Project Governance Policy C591. In the case of those projects that are recommended for unconstrained funding, Administration has included the ward location, as requested through Question 19-146C. Administration has also used this process to respond to the motion made at Executive Committee on October 29/30, 2018, to provide additional information regarding the Industrial Roads program referenced in CR_6273 (City’s Industrial Area Review) for the Winterburn, West Mistatim and Southeast Industrial areas. A high-level estimate for this program is referenced within the updated Appendix C on line 104. As the information in this memo contains very preliminary estimates and decisions which have not yet been made, this memo is considered and should be kept confidential.

The lands included in the transaction(s) consist of: ● Approximately 11.89 acres of industrial land currently operating as the Westwood Bus Garage ● Approximately 32.79 acres of lands within the Blatchford Redevelopment Since Council’s approval, the City and NAIT have negotiated and executed a conditional agreement for the Westwood Bus Garage site and have also reached a conditional sale agreement on the final terms and conditions of the land sale agreement for the Blatchford Redevelopment land. On October 9, 2018, NAIT's Board delegated the authority to the Executive Committee of the Board, to approve the agreement. NAIT’s Executive Committee met on October 16 and provided an executed copy of the sale agreement to the City. As per the terms and conditions previously approved by City Council, the Westwood Bus Garage agreement is due to close in January 2019. However, the City will be leasing the property back for a nominal rate, until the end of 2020, to align with Administration’s project timelines to transition City Operations to the new Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. The sale agreement for the Blatchford land will close in 2023 and is conditional upon a variety of factors, including subdivision and rezoning. Over the next five years, Administration and NAIT will work towards the fulfillment of the sale conditions in support of future campus expansion.

The report outlined a process for evaluating options and executing a procurement approach that would allow a transition to 100% green electricity for City operations. The timeline and general approach agreed to by City Council was 18 to 24 months to establish a project management structure, conduct a comprehensive options analysis, outline a viable procurement strategy, and execute on the decided upon approach. The following has been completed over the past six months to advance this work: 1. Negotiations completed to amend and extend the City’s current electricity services agreement with Enmax. The first five-year term of this contract was to end on December 31, 2018 and the decision to extend was deemed the lowest risk option that allows for price certainty and continuity of retail billing services while the best option for green procurement is developed. The amended contract will reduce the annual forecasted electricity cost by $700,000. This is a no penalty extension and will in no way restrict the City from moving ahead to procure green power. 2. Recruitment of a project manager with the necessary utilities background to advance the project. The successful applicant, Gary Cook, was hired into the position November 13, 2018. 3. Developed a project management plan, schedule and governance structure to engage senior leadership, stakeholders and City Council, manage the risks of the project, and confirm decision points and deliverables. 4. A meeting was held on November 21, 2018, with a subcommittee of the Energy Transition Advisory Committee so that initial input could be obtained on the Options Analysis to be completed in the first half of 2019. This piece of work is a necessary exercise to find the best, lowest cost, most viable procurement option for the City of Edmonton that meets all policy objectives. 5. Negotiations completed to procure approximately 30% of Edmonton’s electricity from an Alberta renewable energy generator through the purchase of renewable energy certificates for the 2018 and 2019 generating years. This will allow the City to continue to reduce its carbon emissions while concurrently evaluating its green procurement options. The intent is to present a fulsome update to Executive Committee in spring 2019. Please let us know if you have any questions.

This memorandum provides information relating to the application of the Sustainable Building Policy to City Facility projects that have completed the concept phase and for which design has been initiated, for the period of May 2, 2017 - May 2, 2018. This memo has been reviewed by the Energy Transition Advisory Committee with no concerns identified. Policy Progress: Design and Construction of City-Owned Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.1 ) One (1) new project within the reporting period was classified as a major renovation project and is targeting LEED Silver certification requirements. This project is the Ortona Armouries Arts Centre . Eight (8) new projects are in the Design Phase and are targeting to meet LEED, energy targets and 1% on-site renewable/alternative energy generation. They are: ● African Multicultural Centre ● Edmonton Police Service Firearms Facilities ● Ambleside Integrated Yard ● Fort Edmonton Park Hotel Expansion ● Thomas Ferrier Garage Bus Storage Replacement ● Lewis Farms Community Recreation Centre and Library ● Mayfield (NW) Eco Station ● Windermere Fire Station* * The Windermere Fire Station is funded for design and construction. It is on track to exceed the targets of C532 Sustainable Building Policy as a pilot for Net-Zero Energy status. Since the targets were only recently approved in May 2017 there are no current projects in the construction phase that meet the current requirements of the Sustainable Building Policy (C532). Construction Certification-Exempt projects (i.e. those smaller than the 500m 2 or unoccupied) are demonstrating within project report deliverables how the project will be designed and constructed to meet the intent of this Policy. Sustainability in existing City-Owned buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.2 ) The BOMA BEST Certification rollout plan will be completed in December 2018. Twenty-five (25) Energy Audits (EAs) have been completed between May 2017 and May 2018. The recommendations from these EAs are being implemented into routine lifecycle replacement and capital rehabilitation planning processes alongside Building Condition Assessments (BCAs) to develop a scope of work for Rehabilitation and Energy-Retrofit projects. The objective is to complete between 25 to 40 EAs per year and stay proactive in gathering significant details and information for existing assets. Twenty-four (24) City-owned large buildings initially participated in the City of Edmonton Large Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Program pilot year in 2017. This number has expanded to 50 buildings participating by the end of 2018. Full participation of all City-owned large buildings is anticipated by 2019. City Acquisition of Existing Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.3 ) No acquisition of existing buildings where the City intends to retain the building or lease to others have taken place since the Sustainable Building Policy was approved. The majority of acquisitions have been to support major capital projects such as the LRT and Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion program. Notwithstanding, the pre-acquisition process is being aligned and amended to include the requirement to perform an energy assessment on buildings in advance of acquiring the property. City Owned buildings Leased to Others ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.4 ) The current state for leasing has a number of agreements that reference the Policy C532 including Telus World of Science and The Aviation Museum. In 2018, the Real Estate Branch began development of a revised lease template that will be used for all lease renewals, an assessment of how the lease must be changed to incorporate C532 requirements is under way. City-Leased Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.5 ) The Real Estate Branch has initiated, for the leasing process, a program to screen potential buildings and facilities based on the requirements of Policy C532. This process includes understanding the status of the buildings and facilities energy use, emissions, and ability to achieve or maintain BOMA Best. It also includes negotiating lease and site improvement work, examples over the last year include: ● Edmonton Tower lease, complies with Policy C532. Administration has applied for LEED Commerc","LEED Commercial Interiors for our furniture and design of Edmonton Tower. It is expected to be awarded in 2019. ● Edmonton Police Service new lease for 7,400 m 2 , complies with Policy C532. ● Lease negotiations for Citizen Services includes HVAC replacements to increase comfort while reducing emissions (LEED Requirement). ● Versa Tenant Improvements to include harvesting of furniture (LEED Requirement). City-funded non-City owned Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.6 ) New eligible non-City owned buildings, that are more than 33% funded by the City are meeting the same policy standards that are required of new City-owned building that are eligible by C532 policy. These are reported in section 1.1.3b) “new construction projects”. Exceptions to this Policy ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.7 ) ‘Exceptions’ are facilities that would normally be in the scope of C532 policy, but for some extraordinary reasons may be allowed. This would require facilities to submit supporting documentation to the Sustainable Building Team and upon support from this group gain approval from the Deputy City Manager of Integrated Infrastructure Services to formally authorize an Exception to the policy. No exceptions were requested nor authorized for the period of May 2, 2017 to May 2, 2018.

The cost per stall to construct parking facilities can vary based on a number of factors. The size, shape, design, soil conditions, topography, shoring, and aesthetics are just a few of the factors. Another consideration is the ongoing life cycle costs associated with maintaining the integrity of a facility. Rehabilitation may be required as the facility ages. The Park & Ride Guidelines (Attachment 1) outlines design parameters for City Park & Ride facilities. In keeping with the City objectives, design guidance for Park & Ride includes attention to elements such as environmental design, landscaping and site security, all of which can add to overall project costs. A key principle of the Park & Ride guidelines is ensuring that Park & Ride is flexible and adaptable so that facilities may transition with future development and emerging mobility and technology options. Examples of how this is accounted for in the design of surface park and ride is ensuring block sizes and aisle widths that are able to transition to transit oriented development. For structured above-ground parking, wrap-around retail/mixed used is expected at street level and level floor plates with adequate floor to ceiling heights to enable conversion to commercial uses. These design elements have higher cost implications for parking facilities. The costs presented in the Park & Ride Guidelines were provided by Coriolis Consulting Corporation. Coriolis Consulting Corporation has expertise in urban land economics, urban planning, urban development and real estate analysis. Capital costs per stall for structured parking was based on construction cost estimates from data published by quantity surveyors and construction cost index providers. The capital cost assumes $35,000 per stall to construct and $3,500 (10% of construction cost) towards renewal costs over the life of the facility. A scan of literature, City projects and discussions with industry was completed at Council's request to have a better understanding how cost estimates may vary. In general, cost estimates depend on the quality of the infrastructure, elements included (bioswales, lighting, security) and ""soft costs"" which typically include development approvals, land costs, land surveys etc. Attachment 2 includes a reference list. The review suggests the following range can be applied to the initial capital cost of Park & Ride facilities (not including operating, renewal or maintenance costs): Facility Type Cost Estimate Range Per Stall Typical Planning Level Cost Estimate per stall Surface - Paved $2,000 to $10,000 -$5,000 Parking Garages - Free Standing (above grade) $20,000 to $35,000 -$30,000 Parking Garages - Underground $30,000 to $50,000 -$50,000 Cost estimate provided above are typically used for initial planning of facilities. As projects proceed through concept design, preliminary and detailed design, the estimates are refined.

The attached tables provide a listing of all tax-supported debt (TSD) projects with outstanding debentures as at September 30, 2018. For the purpose of this memo, taxsupported debt is as defined in the City's Debt Management Fiscal Policy (DMFP) and reported against the City's tax-supported debt limit including both tax-supported debt as well as self-supporting tax-guaranteed debt. A few things to note when viewing the attachments: • The City borrows quarterly for capital projects as project expenditures are incurred, as a result large capital projects that span multiple years will have multiple debentures associated with them. For example, the Milner Library project has borrowed $21.8M to date, over 3 debentures taken in 2017 and 2018, with interest rates ranging from 2.42% to 3.10%. • The information included in the attachments includes only amounts borrowed up to September 30, 2018. For clarity the attachments do not include borrowing for approved capital projects not yet borrowed. For example, the 6 Yellowhead Trail profiles approved in 2017 have borrowed $9.6M to date, leaving $501.2M to be borrowed over the remainder of the project. Some of the other significant projects in progress include Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage , Valley Line Southeast, Milner Library, Co-located Dispatch, and CRL projects. • Attachment 2, provides debt servicing each year and by project until the debt matures for that project. • The information includes all projects regardless of dollar value as most projects considered for debt would be greater than $1 OM.

Administration was asked to provide the reports at the November 14, 2018, Community and Public Services Committee meeting. At the November 14th meeting, a request to delay the reports to January 30th was submitted and a memo was shared with City Council to provide context. At the November 27, 2018 Council meeting, Council revised the due date for CR_6040 to December 11, 2018.

This report provides the list of anomalous zones identified by Councillors and Administration’s recommendation regarding each zone. Administration recommends this report go to Community and Public Services Committee on January 16th, 2019 to allow members of the public to register to speak. ● CR_6326 Playground Zone Guidelines. This report presents the guidelines that could be used to determine playground zones based on both Provincial Guidelines as well as City of Edmonton criteria. Administration recommends this report go to Community and Public Services Committee on January 16th, 2019 to be considered concurrently with the list of anomalous zones. At the January 16, 2019 meeting, Community and Public Services Committee could recommend the list of anomalous zones, either as presented by Administration or amended by motion, to the next Council meeting (January 22, 2019). Administration could bring the required bylaw amendments to implement the list to that meeting. Alternatively, Council could approve the final list and Administration would commit to removing or varying signage as needed immediately following the meeting and returning with the bylaw amendments as soon as possible.

Key Messages: ● The City of Edmonton is committed to working with the business owners to promote a healthy and vibrant community for everyone. ● The City of Edmonton Business Licence Bylaw (section 7), sets out the grounds upon which a licence may be cancelled, including when a Licensee has breached a condition of the Licence or contravened the Business Licence Bylaw. The City of Edmonton Business Licensing and Vehicle for Hire Unit has issued a decision to cancel the license of Nyala lounge based on a submission received from the Public Safety Compliance Team. ● This decision is subject to appeal. If the owner of Nyala Lounge decides to appeal the decision, it will be made to the Community Standards and Licence Appeal Committee (CSLAC). Approach : Communications will respond to media calls by providing a spokesperson from the Vehicle for Hire and Business Licensing unit to speak to the licence cancellation process. As the decision is subject to appeal, and CSLAC is a Council Committee, it would be inappropriate for councillors to comment on the decision to cancel during the appeal process. PSCT is the official complainant in the case and will be not be notified in advance - they will be notified at the same time as the licensee. PSCT may wish to speak to issues of enforcement. Background: The Public Safety Compliance Team first received reports of issues with Nyala Lounge in May of 2015. As part of its commitment to public safety, the City of Edmonton is a member of the Public Safety Compliance Team which works proactively with businesses to ensure they are compliant with municipal bylaws and provincial legislation. The Public Safety Compliance Team - a multi-agency regulatory team designed to coordinate the efforts of the municipal and provincial agencies involved in the licensing, regulation and enforcement of licensed business venues - is made up of the Edmonton Police Service (EPS), Edmonton Fire Rescue Services, the City of Edmonton’s Community Standards and Neighbourhoods Branch, and the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission. In February 2018, several conditions were imposed on Nyala's business licence to mitigate concerns surrounding previous public safety incidents identified by PSCT and EPS. In August 2018, PSCT submitted a request for a business licence review to the City of Edmonton Business Licensing and Vehicle for Hire Unit. PSCT's submissions included evidence that the Licensee had breached many of the business licence conditions in February 2018. The Licensee, through its legal counsel, was given the opportunity to respond to PSCT’s submissions. Media coverage on September 24 highlighted the city’s notice to cancel the business licence of Nyala Lounge. On September 25, 2018, the City of Edmonton Business Licensing and Vehicle for Hire Unit discovered the Notice of Proposal to Cancel the Business Licence was not delivered to the address of Mr. Tesfay. As a result, the Decision to Cancel the Business Licence was retracted. The City of Edmonton Business Licensing and Vehicle for Hire Unit has amended the licensee notification process going forward to ensure that any Notice to Cancel a business licence is delivered in person. On September 26, 2018, the City re-issued a Notice of Proposal to Cancel the Business Licence and this notice was delivered to Mr. Tesfay in person. After carefully","fter carefully reviewing the parties’ (Nyala Lounge and PSCT) submissions and the evidence provided, City of Edmonton Business Licensing and Vehicle for Hire Unit decided to cancel the business license for Nyala Lounge. The Licensee has an opportunity to file a notice of appeal within 14 days of receiving the City’s decision to cancel a business licence. This appeal is made to the Community Standards and Licence Appeal Committee (CSLAC). As CSLAC is a Council Committee, it would be inappropriate for councillors to comment on the decision to cancel during the appeal process.

The project is divided into two phases: ● Corridor Planning Phase, and ● Concept Design Phase. City Council approved the Centre LRT corridor through the Downtown (102 Avenue to the North Saskatchewan River) and Whyte Avenue (83 Street to 109 Street) segments on August 21, 2018. In addition to the approval of the Downtown and Whyte Avenue segments, Administration shared information regarding their next steps to investigate the feasibility of using the High Level Bridge in comparison to a potential new bridge to accommodate LRT across the river. Administration also discussed their next steps to continue working with representatives of the University of Alberta, the Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre, and the Garneau community, to identify, discuss and address their concerns in order to identify a Centre LRT corridor alignment through the University area. Given the importance of this project and how it connects with other city-shaping projects, such as the City Plan and Mass Transit Study, Administration recognized the need to revisit the timelines for the next level of planning for the Centre LRT. It was concluded that in this context that the prudent decision would be to delay the concept design until these other City shaping studies are complete. Administration will continue work on completing the corridor identification phase for the river crossing and University areas. This will include detailed assessment work and lifecycle scenarios for expanded river crossing provisions for transportation, further public engagement related to route selection for the University area, and finally a multiple accounts evaluation required to determine the preferred LRT corridor alignment. The preferred Centre LRT corridor at the river crossing and through the University area are anticipated to be presented to City Council in the first quarter of 2020. Administration will continue to update City Council as key milestones are reached.

Minchau Blacksmith Shop, located at 8101 - 101 Street, NW is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. On March 23, 2018, the owner applied for a Development Permit to demolish the building. On April 16, 2018, Administration notified City Council of the proposed demolition of the building. On July 5, 2018, the Subdivision and Development Appeal Board provided notice that it approved the demolition permit (formerly refused by Administration). Following a number of activities outlined in Attachment 1, the Minister of Culture and Tourism requested that the owner prepare a Historical Resource Impact Assessment (HRIA) for the building, which effectively suspended the demolition permit. On December 4, 2018, the Minister of Culture and Tourism notified Mayor Iveson the building has significance at the local level only, does not meet the criteria for designation as a Provincial Historic Resource, and that the Province will not intervene in the demolition of the building. The building remains standing and is currently vacant. However, the owner has applied for an associated Building Permit to demolish the building (the decision is pending). And while the owner will soon be authorized to remove the building, Administration continues to engage the owner to explore options to redevelop the site that preserve/conserve the building. Further, the age, format and content of the existing DC2 Zone in place for the site may motivate the owner to seek an amendment to the Provision that would provide Administration an opportunity to negotiate the preservation/conservation of the building. A copy of the Historical Resource Impact Assessment is available upon request.

First, due to planned track work on Saturday, January 5 and Sunday, January 6, all Capital and Metro trains will run on a 20-minute frequency from 5 a.m. until the end of service, instead of the typical 15-minute frequency. Regular LRT service is scheduled to resume Monday, January 7, 2019. To test the Thales signalling system, public service will be suspended on the Capital and Metro Lines on two occasions in January. The first service suspension will occur Sunday, January 13 from 5 a.m. until 11 a.m., while the second will occur Sunday, January 27 from 5 a.m. until the end of service. Customers will still see trains operating on the tracks, but will not be permitted to board. Bus replacement service will run between stations, including along the Metro Line (between NAIT and Churchill) every 15 minutes, while Capital Line replacement buses will operate every 7-8 minutes. Schedule information will be available through 311 and the Transit Trip Planner on takeETS.com. The City expects the evaluation of the Thales signalling system to take a number of months to complete, which will include a review of documentation and field testing to determine if Thales has met their contractual obligations. The City anticipates there will be 1.5 days of system-wide LRT suspensions each month to accommodate testing, and will work to minimize disruptions for ETS customers, motorists and pedestrians as much as possible. ETS will notify customers through onsite signage, social media, takeETS.com, 311, advertising and public service announcements that will be issued to media.

This memorandum provides information and insight as to the resources available to achieve a more desirable development landscape across the city. Administration addresses unsightly properties and derelict buildings through various regulations and programs. The information provided below outlines the policies, procedures and tools from the perspective of Development Services, Community Standards and Fire Rescue Services. UFCSD, Development Services The Alberta Building Code is referenced for the design, construction and occupancy of a structure. Additional building code reference may apply in situations such as 'change of use', 'demolition', 'addition/renovation/reconstruction'. Ongoing maintenance of structures remains the responsibility of the owner. In rare cases, where a building has been neglected to a point where the structural integrity has been compromised, a Safety Codes Officer may exercise actions under The Safety Codes Act. The Act has provisions to consider structural issues with unsightly properties through the lens of an unsafe condition or imminent danger. Determination of these concerns denotes that the endangerment of life, limb or health of any person expected to be on or about the premises or where the life or building safety of an adjacent property may be affected (e.g. building collapse). Procedural options for addressing unsafe or imminent danger assessments are as follows: 1) Securing the Site - fencing is placed around the site in a secure fashion 2) Issue a Safety Codes Act Order - this identifies actions required to correct and resolve the violation within a defined timeline to avoid further penalty, and/or 3) Review of Affected Adjacent Properties - instructions to mitigate risk of life or building safety to adjacent properties as part of a Safety Codes Act Order 4) Legal Proceedings - failure to comply with a Safety Codes Order may escalate to Court actions. The Safety Codes Officers follow a severity of escalation process to assist in determining the procedural actions to implement. A process flowchart provides guidance and is a tool to facilitate decision making (Attachment 1: Safety Codes Violation Escalation Flowchart). Safety Codes Officers work closely with property owners in providing education towards voluntary compliance. In some cases where an owner is not capable, the City of Edmonton may take actions to mitigate risks. Associated costs are extended to the referenced property taxes. In addition, electronic system enhancements related to follow up on delinquent permits or actions are identified to strengthen these procedures. This may include the automation of the current database to execute follow up actions such as unfinished construction projects. The Alberta Building Code does not specifically address aesthetic maintenance of buildings. In most cases, the orders of the Safety Code Officer will only extend to the securing of the site. Citizen Services, Community Standards & Neighbourhoods Section 6 of the Community Standards Bylaw, Bylaw 14600 (the Bylaw) addresses nuisances on land. It provides bylaw enforcement officers with the authority to investigate properties that show signs of serious disregard for general maintenance and upkeep. This may include excessive accumulation of material, unkempt grass or weeds, smelly compost heaps, and any loose building or construction materials. Section 9 of the Bylaw addresses nuisances with respect to buildings/structures. It provides bylaw enforcement officers with the authority to investigate buildings that show signs of a serious disregard for general maintenance and upkeep. This may include damage to the building or structure, graffiti, any rot or deterioration within the building, and any inappropriate infiltration of air, water or moisture into the building due to untreated surfaces, holes, or missing doors/windows. The Vacant Commercial Building Compliance Officer addresses vacant, commercial derelict buildings on a complaint or referral basis. Once reported, an inspection is conducted and the officer will determine whether a violation of the Bylaw has occurred. Community Standards has policies and procedural frameworks in place for bylaw enforcem","ent officers to draw from when dealing with properties exhibiting nuisance conditions. Citizen Services, Fire Rescue Services Under the authority of the Alberta Safety Codes Act (the Act), Fire Safety Codes Officers are granted powers of inspection for the purpose of ensuring that the Act or anything issued under the Act are complied with. These powers differ slightly depending on the type of property being entered: • A Fire Safety Codes Officer may, without warrant, at any reasonable time, enter a premises or place, except a private dwelling place that is in use as a dwelling, in which the officer has reason to believe there is something to which this Act applies and may, using reasonable care, carry out an inspection and additional related duties. • A Fire Safety Codes Officer may enter a private dwelling place used as a dwelling, using reasonable care, to carry out an inspection and review designs with: a) Consent of the owner or occupant b) With a warrant from a Justice. The Safety Codes Act grants the authority to apply relevant regulations which are primarily the Alberta Fire Code. Further authority is granted to issue a Safety Codes order if the officer believes, on reasonable and probable grounds, that there is danger of serious injury or damage to a person or property. Application of the Alberta Fire Code works in conjunction with the Alberta Building Code. However, the Fire Code is considered a maintenance document and has limited application in many residential dwellings. Fire Rescue Services has limited legal authority to resolve problems associated with derelict private dwellings. Fire Safety Codes Officers have the ability to act on ensuring that the restoration of existing fire protection equipment is performed, to restore equipment to a fully functional condition, within reason. Other means are available to limit the risk to responding emergency personnel in unoccupied buildings. Fire crews may be assigned to perform ""pre incident planning"" evaluations of identified at risk buildings. In addition, these building may be benchmarked as a ""location of interest"" at the Emergency Communications Dispatch Centre which informs responding emergency crews of potential elevated risk. Summary While Administration has multiple regulatory frameworks to draw from to address challenges of derelict properties, these frameworks largely focus on ensuring a minimum life safety standard and addressing unsightly land standards. The regulations do not typically address the visual appearance of the structures on the property. However, Administration does collaborate with colleagues across departments to determine the best approach for addressing an unsightly or derelict property. The identified gaps in policies, procedures and tools will be addressed to provide staff with the tools to continue their work. Strategies that will be explored include: • Common Definitions - Various municipal regulatory frameworks and procedures use different descriptors to define conditions of buildings. A common definition may better support cross collaboration. • Occupied Properties Tools- Strategies that support resolutions where there are gaps in regulations could see a change to more desirable properties, • Long Term Vacant Properties - Provisions to address vacant properties in excess of five years may further enhance the commercial and residential landscape. • Derelict Property Tax Subclass - Under the City of Edmonton Charter, Edmonton has been granted authority to create a derelict property tax subclass, if it regards it as appropriate. There are, however, significant challenges with adopting such an approach. More information on this option will be explored in the Property Tax Policy Discussion Paper anticipated to be published in 2019. Administration is committed to working with communities and property owners to address concerns relating to unsightly and derelict properties. Administrative teams meet regularly to discuss and identify work plans to seek resolutions to high priority unsightly or derelict properties. Community Standards will lead further discussions to explore the strategies listed. It is anticipated a strategic initiative will be developed by the third quarter of 2019. Development Services, Fire Rescue Services and other colleagues across the departments will participate as required.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2018, as part of the Jasper Place Historic Resources Inventory project. Built circa 1932, the Cameron Residence is a humble one-storey, front-gabled cottage with a small enclosed front porch on the east façade and a shed roof canopy over its north entry. The wooden-frame home has bottle-glass stucco cladding with wooden detailing and multi-light windows. The Cameron Residence possesses value as an example of a working-class cottage built during the Depression era, and one that contributed to the inter-war development of the former Town of Jasper Place. Settlement in the initial subdivisions of this area was meager until the late 1920s. With the onset of the Great Depression, many residents of Edmonton departed the city into adjacent municipalities, seeking affordability and lower mill rates on their residential properties. The historic subdivision of Jasper Place, at the time located in the Municipal District of Spruce Grove No. 519, became a haven for those that could not afford property ownership in Edmonton, yet allowed them to be in close proximity to the city for employment and services. The Cameron Residence was built for Ewan Cameron, a general labourer, who retired in the mid-1930s. The house was conveniently positioned three blocks west of 149 Street (Edmonton’s western boundary from 1913 to 1964), and two blocks south of Stony Plain Road, a primary corridor providing accessibility to Edmonton. Even with its close proximity to the city, for the first two decades the house, like most others in the area, had no utilities. The property is zoned (RF1) Low Density Residential Zone. The owner has applied to subdivide the property to facilitate the creation of two new residential parcels. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent.

The first map shows calls to 311 requesting needle pickup on public property by neighbourhood in Edmonton. The second map shows the numbers of needles collected by the City on public property by neighbourhood in Edmonton. The maps, which will be updated quarterly, are now posted on edmonton.ca/needlesmap. Key highlights: • 311 calls for needle pick up increased by 50 percent between 2017 and 2018 (648 vs 972 calls). • More ca lls to 311 haven't meant more needles on the ground. The City collected 45 percent fewer needles in 2018 than 2017 (4,226 vs 7,739 needles). • A public information campaign encouraging citizens to report discarded needles on public property was launched in 2018. • Despite the overall decrease in needles collected from 2017 to 2018, Strathcona (48 vs 292 needles) and Central McDougall (203 vs 665 needles) saw increases. • Variations in the number of needles collected may be attributed to seasons and the disposal of large numbers of needles at one time. Needles in Edmonton can safely be disposed at pharmacies, needle boxes and through a free needle exchange service. The City of Edmonton is continually adjusting its approach to needle collection. This began with a comprehensive review of needle pick up in Edmonton by the City and its partners in 2015 and continues with the development of these maps. Needle data is crucial in helping us ensure City resources are placed where they're needed most. The information in these maps has been requ ested by media and will be released on January 21, 2019. Edmontonians who encounter a needle on public property are encouraged to call 311. Our goal is to have needles collected within two hours of the ca ll between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., seven days a week.

We anticipate that the Administration will receive questions from the media and residents as to whether we intend to take over the responsibility. Edmontonians will also be deeply concerned about the welfare of animals in distress. Administration is working to clarify the position of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on filling this essential function. We will bring a report to City Council when a response is received and seek Council’s direction on the next steps. City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton is deeply concerned about the loss of this service. We have reached out to the appropriate ministries with the Government of Alberta for direction on their next steps. Key Messages: ● We are working to bring the agencies that have responsibilities for animal welfare together to find a solution. ● While we are working toward a solution, the City’s Animal Care and Control team can respond to urgent reports of animals in distress. The Edmonton Police Service will continue to investigate willful acts of cruelty to animals under the criminal code. Approach : The Edmonton Humane Society is solely responsible for announcing its decision to change its mandate. The City of Edmonton can respond to questions from the media based on our efforts to bring all the accountable parties to the table. Background: The Solicitor General of Alberta and the Minister of Public Security have appointed Peace officers from the Alberta SPCA, the Calgary Humane Society and the Edmonton Humane Society to enforce the Animal Protection Act. The Ministry of Forestry and Agriculture provides financial support to the Alberta SPCA to deliver service outside of Edmonton and Calgary. The City of Edmonton collects a surcharge on dog and cat licenses ($3.50 per cat and $6 per dog) that funds the Humane Society for adoption and enforcement services, totalling approximately $550,000 annually. The rest of the EHS budget comes from charitable donations. The Humane Society has offered to forego the pet license surcharge funding after it ceases animal protection work. Up to this point, the division of responsibility between the EHS and the City’s Animal Care and Control Centre is that the EHS protects animals from people (investigates abuse and neglect) and the City protects people from animals (dog bites, animals at large etc.). The RCMP and Edmonton Police Service usually take over investigations of willful acts of cruelty and neglect that are covered under the Criminal Code of Canada. Due to funding limitations, the EHS operated with minimal peace officer staffing. The caseload has varied between 760 to 1,200 cases per year from 2016 to 2018. The EHS currently has 132 open files. The EHS has not proposed an exit strategy or an approach for dealing with cases that are currently before the courts.

All three buildings are on the Inventory of Historic Resources and all are owned by the same property owner. They are located on the west side of 122 Street, just north of Jasper Avenue. Administration has limited information on these buildings. All were added to the Inventory in 1993. The buildings appear to have been built in 1914, possibly by the same builder, although this cannot be confirmed. The Strain Residence, located at 10136 - 122 Street NW, is a two-storey, wood frame residence with a small, enclosed front porch. It has a low-pitch hip roof, with flared eaves, and dormer on the second floor. The lower level of the front elevation has wood siding; however, the rest of the exterior has been clad in stucco, likely over the original clapboard. A large, two-storey addition was added to the rear of the building at some point in time. A large bay window is a feature on the south elevation. It appears the house was first occupied by Edward Hammond; no information on Hammond was found. The Hunter Residence, located at 10140 - 122 Street NW, is immediately to the north of the Strain Residence, and is a two-storey wood frame residence with an enclosed front verandah. It has an original brick foundation, and a steeply-pitched gable roof with wood eaves and knee brackets. The exterior of the building is clad in original horizontal wood siding on the lower level, and original wood shingles on the the upper level. A small addition has been made to the rear of the building. It appears the original owner was Robert Hunter, a co-owner of the Hunter-Loghrin Lumber Company with James Loghrin. The Gillrie Residence, located at 10142 - 122 Street NW, is immediately to the north of the Hunter Residence, and is a two-storey wood frame residence with an open verandah. It features a side-gable roof, with a large dormer with a front-facing gable roof on the second level. The exterior of the building is clad in original horizontal clapboard siding. A large, two-storey addition was added to the rear of the building at some point in time. A large bay window is a feature on the south elevation. It appears the house was first occupied by Oliver Irvine; no information on Irvine was found. The property owner is seeking to demolish the three residences in order to accommodate new development on the six lots along this block face. At this time, they are contemplating the development of townhouses on the site, but no formal applications have been received in this regard. They have been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the buildings as Municipal Historic Resources. However, the owner wishes to move forward with demolition in order to prepare the site for new development. The three houses are in a very poor state of repair. The previous owner of the properties commissioned a Building Conditions Report in 2012. The report concludes that the buildings all present a range of significant condition issues, ranging from major cracking in the foundation, structural failure, exterior cladding deterioration, window damage, and roof issues. All three properties have been vacant for some time, and the windows and doors are boarded over. The Edmonton Police Service has advised that they are responding to frequent and recurring calls and complaints from the owners and adjacent residents and business owners in the immediate area regarding break-ins at the buildings, substance abuse, noise and vandalism to adjacent properties. In some instances, these are occurring multiple times in a single week. The ongoing vandalism and break-ins have caused significant damage to the buildings, in particular the interiors, which are not salvageable. The property owner has satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. Providing all other permit condi","tions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permits within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team David Hales, Manager, Development Services Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments","No",,,

January 26-27 On Saturday, January 26, all LRT trains will run every 20 minutes from 5 a.m. until 2 p.m., instead of the typical 15-minute frequency. This planned track work was scheduled after the distribution of the December 29, 2018 Council memo. Regular LRT service is scheduled to resume at 2 p.m. As a reminder, a full-day, system-wide LRT closure is scheduled for Sunday, January 27 to accommodate City testing of the Thales signalling system. Customers will still see trains running, but will not be allowed to board. Buses will replace the LRT from 5 a.m. until the end of service. Metro Line replacement buses will operate every 15 minutes between NAIT and Churchill, including eastbound bus stops by Bay and Central. Capital Line replacement buses will operate every 7-8 minutes. Regular LRT service is scheduled to resume Monday, January 28. The evaluation of the Thales signalling system is expected to take a number of months. ETS anticipates there will be one and a half days of system-wide LRT closures per month for testing. Sundays are typically selected for LRT closures due to lower ridership compared to other days.

Currently, the City operates approximately 840 Park & Ride stalls at Century Park, therefore this transition will leave the City with approximately 390 stalls, which will be offered as free parking. Customers currently paying for a City-operated reserved stall at Century Park will have the option to make independent arrangements with the developer’s private Park & Ride or use the City-operated free parking on a first come first served basis . Throughout February, parking customers will be informed of these changes through signage, social media, ads, handouts, web notifications, public service announcement and 311. For added context, the overall land lease expires in March 2020. At that time, the City will surrender all remaining stalls back to the developer. The developer intends to operate private Park & Ride stalls until 2025 or until they begin construction on the site. As construction progresses, the developer will replace Park & Ride stalls with shared parkade and underground parking.

This initiative will support the goal to create improved mobility for Edmontonians by minimizing the amount of time and/or public space occupied for construction and maintenance activities. Cities across Canada, such as Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, and Toronto , use a similar approach to collect fees for the permitting and temporary use of public road right-of-way. OSCAM permits are issued for the temporary use of any public road right-of-way, including roadways, sidewalks, boulevards, bike lanes, and shared-use paths, related to construction and maintenance activities. OSCAM permits are required for: ● All work that involves excavation of roadways, sidewalks, or boulevards ● All work on freeways, river crossings, in the downtown core, or Whyte Avenue area ● Non-excavation work that interferes with traffic flows on major roadways during the hours of 6-9am and/or 3:30-6:30pm, excluding weekends and holidays ● Non-excavation work locations with a duration of more than 4 hours at any one location ● Multiple non-excavation work locations, each less than 4 hours in duration, but closer than 250m apart are considered to be one location and require an OSCAM permit. ● Temporary crossing of a sidewalk and/or boulevard for the purpose of accessing private lands from a public roadway. In the development of the daily fee, public engagement began in Q2 of 2017 and was completed with stakeholders that included user groups and representatives from the development, utility and road builders industries. In December 2018, an email was sent to approximately 3,000 previous OSCAM users to provide background regarding the fee and to communicate its implementation. Administration is responding to follow-up inquiries and is working more closely with industry partners, such as the home building and infill development industries, to address their concerns. The $25/day OSCAM permit fee will be implemented February 24, 2019. The implementation date was slightly delayed to follow up on recent inquiries from industry, (specifically Infill Development), and to further automate the processing of fees. In 2019, Administration plans to further engage stakeholders regarding a potential occupancy fee associated with the daily use of road right-of-way. If there are further questions regarding the implementation of the OSCAM fees, please contact Darryl Mullen, General Supervisor of Signs, Detours and Traffic Field Operations at (780) 496-1699 or darryl .mullen@edmonton.ca .

This was sad news and I have been in contact with Fort Edmonton Park’s Chief Executive Officer, Darren Dagliesh and others in Administration to gather some background and context. The City’s Corporate Procurement and Supply Services branch assisted the Park staff with the sale of the animals. Fort Edmonton Park herd stock have been auctioned in the past. Fort Edmonton Park management anticipated that the horses would be purchased by a private owner as they were healthy and not yet at retirement age. The Park’s policy is to sell or rehome only healthy animals; the staff would provide medical care onsite for any of their animals that require it. The two horses from Fort Edmonton Park were among 60 from various owners sold at Saturday’s auction. Fort Edmonton Park animal care staff have processes in place that include annual veterinary check-ups, regular medical care, daily (or more frequent) welfare checks, regular pasture monitoring and high-quality food, shelter and equipment.

Based on the current forecast, we are expecting up to ten centimetres of snow overnight with up to four centimeters additional snow for the next 48 hours. Our first priority is on reaching bare pavement to ensure the safety of commuters. The following is an update on the City of Edmonton’s response to the current snowfall. Resources All available equipment is currently deployed. As part of our snow and ice program, we have a capacity to deploy up to 112 plows (with the ability to apply sand, salt, or anti-icer), an additional 31 plows (without sanders), 21 graders, 14 loaders, 12 sidewalk plows and sanders, and nine skid steers (also known as bobcats). This equipment capacity is complemented by up to 600 staff who operate across six shift schedules to provide coverage 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Strategy Our current focus is on plowing in order to remove snow from roads as quickly as possible as snowfall continues. We are also applying sand only as needed to provide additional traction. Given the temperatures, humidity level, and wet road conditions prior to snowfall, we did not apply liquid anti-icer (calcium chloride) to roadways in advance of this snow event. As part of our snow and ice policy, crews are continuing to plow through the snowfall, with the first priority on freeways, main arterial roads (including arterial bike lanes), and bus collector routes. Priority sidewalks will also be cleared within 48 hours of the end of snowfall. Next Steps We will monitor conditions and determine if additional support is required to reach bare pavement. We will also monitor snowpack levels on residential roads and implement neighbourhood blading once five centimetres of snow has accumulated. .../2 -2- Communication Through our messaging to the public, we are continuing to emphasize the importance of driving to conditions, and to commute carefully, whether on a road, bike lane, or sidewalk.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2017, as part of the Glenora Historic Resources Inventory project. Bui lt in 1954, the Kendal Residence is valued as a highly intact and well-designed manifestation of a Modern-style bungalow in Glenora. The Modern style is defined by a break from traditionalism, and incorporation of new technology and materials into the design. Built forms of this style are highly varied but many feature linear, rambling massing, and often have large slab chimneys. The Kendal Residence is an excellent example of the Modern style as expressed by its one-storey height, use of materials such as horizontal waney board siding, and design elements including the striking exposed red brick chimney and planter that anchor the centre of the front fa~ade . The Kendal Residence was built by John May, a local contractor who built several identical homes throughout the neighbourhood and city. 117(1)1 .. .12 -2- The property is zoned (RF1) Low Density Residential Zone. The owner has applied to subdivide the parcel into two new narrow lot parcels to facilitate the development of two new single detached dwellings. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week.

Five times a year ETS makes schedule adjustments to improve service reliability, efficiency and connections. ETS will also be informing customers about service changes for Family Day (February 18), Reading Week (February 19-22) and school breaks (March). For schedule adjustments starting February 10, more than 30 bus schedules have been modified, which may result in changes to arrival and departure times for each of t hese routes. Due to lower ridership, all morning trips on Routes 48, 84, 92, 118, 562, as well as all morning and afternoon trips on Route 589, will use 30-foot community buses instead of conventional 40-foot buses. The conventional 40-foot buses will be redeployed to higher demand routes or those requiring additional schedule adherence support. School Special schedules for Routes 810, 965 and 968 have also been modified to better accommodate dismissal times at their respective schools. Furthermore, a new School Special, Route 961 from Jasper Place High School to Lewis Farms, has been created to address overcrowding on Route 956 to the Hamptons. ETS encourages customers to double check route brochures and use the ETS Transit Trip Planner or real-time tools to see if their route schedule will be adjusted. ETS has enhanced in-a pp communications by manually adding notification banners in individual routes affected by these changes. Customers can also find information about schedule adjustments for Family Day, and additional holidays in February and March, on takeETS.com/news . GC/ER/PH/JEs. c: Linda Sahli, City Clerk",,"No",,,

Early indications are that the service disruption is due to a signalling system issue. Replacement bus service was arranged between NAIT and Churchill. Regular LRT service resumed at approximately noon. City of Edmonton Position: A signalling system issue resulted in the stoppage of LRT service between NAIT and Churchill Stations between 8:30 a.m. and noon. All passengers safely disembarked from the trains at LRT stations, and replacement buses were arranged. Capital Line also experienced minor service delays. Key Messages: ● A signalling system issue on the Metro Line resulted in an unplanned service outage between NAIT and Churchill Stations and minor delays on the Capital Line. ● Crossing gates were also activated as a result of the signalling system issue, resulting in delays for some motorists, pedestrians and buses. ● All passengers safely disembarked at LRT stations, and replacement buses were arranged to move passengers to their destinations. ETS Inspectors assisted passengers at LRT stations. ● ETS technical services has completed an inspection and confirmed there is no interference from ETS equipment. ● The City is assessing the issue, which will inform the ongoing evaluation of the Thales signalling system. ● Scheduled LRT testing will proceed this Sunday, February 10, as part of the City’s ongoing evaluation of the Thales signalling system. ● All evaluation activities will help ensure that we — and all Edmontonians — have the signalling system we asked for and were promised. Approach : ● Communications is providing service impact updates through social media, and thanking passengers, motorists and pedestrians for their patience as we work through the disruption. ● The City has received three media inquiries so far. Those inquiries are being addressed with a statement. We will continue to monitor media interest and will adjust our approach as appropriate. Background: Initial information indicated the service disruption occurred at approximately 8:30 a.m for Metro trains between NAIT and Churchill. ETS quickly initiated protocols to operate trains in manual mode, communicate with Control and get passengers safely disembarked at the nearest station. To keep trains in their running order, some Metro Line trains ran along the Capital Line (including to Clareview Station); however, they were marked out of service and passengers were not allowed to board. The system was re-activating crossing gates coming down despite manual intervention to keep them up. Staff continued to investigate this anomaly and manually lift the gates and allow vehicles and pedestrians to safely cross the tracks. Some trains were temporarily docked at stations while the situation was assessed. The Capital Line continued to operate with some minor delays. Bus routes 8, 9, 12, 15, 125, 130, and 143 are also experiencing some delays due to the LRT delays. Media coverage: CTV: Metro LRT closed due to mechanical issues .

In mid-April, Waste Services will begin a small-scale rollout of a proposed cart-based program for household organic waste separation (kitchen scraps), automated collection for garbage, and seasonal yard waste. This rollout will serve as a demonstration phase. The program is designed to launch in controlled areas first, with a cart set out that has been shaped by feedback from residents in phase one of public engagement. The program will help Waste Services understand which program elements work well prior to implementation of a citywide source separation program. Information from the program will be used to refine and adapt program delivery prior to a larger scale launch. The rollout involves approximately 8,000 single and multi-unit residences from seven wards (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11 & 12). The neighbourhoods are Chambery, Baturyn, Kensington, CY Becker, Brintnell, Delwood, Miller, Beacon Heights, Forest Heights, Kiniski Gardens, Tamarack, Satoo and Ellerslie.

The project includes a review and analysis of the condition and function of the park infrastructure, prioritization of recommendations for the renewal of the park and the development of a draft implementation plan with phasing options, schedule and cost estimates. To also support the development of the plan, public engagement was completed in the summer of 2018 that provided an opportunity for all users, including festival and event organizers, to share their perspectives and feedback on the park. The renewal priorities identified are substantial, with the immediate priority being the replacement of the 50-year-old underground utility infrastructure that should be replaced within the next three to eight years. The implementation plan identifies two options for sequencing the work and includes a holistic and phased approach. The holistic approach would proceed over the shortest possible duration of time and would require a full park closure. This option is being considered as it provides the most efficient (cost and schedule) approach with a focus on minimizing impacts to users. The phased approach would extend the construction schedule over a number of years and is anticipated to add costs to the overall project. The project team will be meeting with the festival and event organizers in February to share information on the draft implementation plan and provide them with an opportunity to give feedback on the impacts of the proposed sequencing options. The feedback gathered from the festival and event organizers, in addition to all other feedback received, will be used to inform the approach to the rehabilitation of the park. 2 We recognize that the potential of any park closure will have significant interest to park users and festival and event organizers. As we finalize our recommended approach to the renewal of the park and the project moves forward into the design and build stages we will continue to work closely with the groups to understand and minimize the impacts. It is anticipated that the design work would be completed within the 2019-2022 Capital Budget cycle with construction in the 2023-2026 Capital Budget cycle unless critical elements are identified that need to be addressed sooner. Once planning and design has sufficiently advanced, the project will be advanced for City Council's consideration as part of a future capital budget deliberation (either SCBA or 2023-26 Capital Budget).

The City has gone from needing mainly snow clearing in the winter to a maintenance program that must be able to address snow and ice on roads, sidewalks, and shared use pathways. At Council’s direction, Administration is conducting an evaluation of alternative means to address snow and ice control. An important component of this evaluation is the residential snow and ice program to identify potential updates to both the Snow and Ice Control Policy (C409J) and the Community Standards Bylaw #14600, in preparation for the 2019/2020 winter season. Proposed improvements may include changes to operational practices and service level delivery. The impacts of potential changes are being explored through engagement with citizens. Receiving input from Edmontonians is an important step in Administration's efforts to improve the snow and ice program and achieve safe and reliable transportation networks for citizens. To that end, Administration will be implementing a public engagement campaign focused on residential ice and snow removal. The engagement opportunities for this project are threefold: 1. To both gauge the level of awareness of the Snow and Ice Control Policy and bylaws in the community and to educate participants about the policy, bylaws, and associated operational practices and challenges that can occur 2. To gather feedback on the areas within the residential snow and ice program that are working well 3. To gather input on areas within the residential snow and ice program that could potentially be improved in time for the 2019/2020 winter season .../2 -2- Engagement methods to gather input and feedback will include an online survey and pop-up sessions at a number of events throughout the city. The neighbourhood pop-up event locations were chosen due to the variety of designs of the neighbourhoods, each of which poses different challenges with snow and ice for citizens and operations. An equal number of neighbourhoods were chosen in the north and south in order to survey residents that experience winter road maintenance performed primarily by City employees (north), and City contractors (south).

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2017, as part of the Glenora Historic Resources Inventory Project. Built in 1953, the Zerr Residence is significant as an intact and good example of the Post-war Modern Bungalow style in the Glenora Community. The home displays the features of this design, which was to become the dominant house form in Alberta by the end of the 1950s. A large picture window and a low, horizontal profile created by a rectangular plan with a long fa~ade, and low-pitched, hipped roof with deeply overhanging eaves characterises this style. The residence possesses a distinctive low-pitched front-gabled 'pediment' which surmounts a wide, very shallow bay, creating a recessed front entry and a bay for the picture window. In March 1953, Fekete Construction Co. Ltd. obtained permits to build houses on all of Lot Nos. 1-23 on Block 67A, the western-most and most attractive cul-de-sac which surrounds a green space. The firm constructed the Zerr Residence at a cost of $9,500 on a large pie-shaped lot on the cul-de-sac. Fekete Construction, a custom home business established in the late 1920s by European-born tradesman John Fekete, was one of Alberta's major homebuilders from 1949 through the early 1970s. At the time the Zerr Residence was built, they were constructing approximately 300 homes annually and advertised themselves as ""builders of quality homes"" with John as President and son Alfred (Fred) as Supervisor. The company has been run by at least three generations of the Fekete family and continues to operate today. 117(1)1 .. ./2 -2- The property is zoned (RF1) Low Density Residential Zone. The owner has applied to build a new single detached dwelling on the subject parcel. The owner has indicated that the house requires repairs to the exterior, as well as new utilities and repairs to the interior.

Unlike during the four-year budget process where Councillors submit questions and Administration provides responses to all Councillors, this format is not in place for supplemental budget adjustments. To ensure a fair and consistent approach in advance of deliberations during City Council meetings, Administration will only be able to answer budget process clarification questions or provide clarity with respect to any information included in the supplemental budget adjustment reports. Questions requesting additional or supplemental information, supporting rationale for reduction strategies, or further analysis will need to be asked and responded to during the City Council meeting(s).

The introduction of paid parking in the area is in response to concerns that NEBA shared with Administration related to vehicle congestion. The expansion of the MacEwan University campus and the opening of Rogers Place in 2016 has created increased parking demands. Administration worked with the NEBA Executive Director in the lead up to this installation to ensure that the Board of Directors, individual business owners, and customers have information regarding the transition to paid parking. Additional efforts include the distribution of information to stakeholders at Macewan University, the Central McDougall Community League and informational meetings as required. Paid parking is an efficient and effective parking management tool used by municipalities to mitigate parking concerns and congestion. When accompanied by appropriate maximum time restrictions, paid parking can stimulate parking turnover and increase parking availability in commercial districts. As a result of the introduction of paid parking in the North Edge Business Association area, Administration anticipates increased parking availability for NEBA patrons, decreased traffic congestion, and a potential increase in the use of additional modes of transportation. Effective March 1, 2019, operating hours will follow the standard EPark guidelines for these new EPark zones and will mirror existing EPark zones in the Downtown Event Region. Paid parking will be in effect 9:00 a.m.- 6:00 p.m. Monday to Saturday. When there is a major evening event at Rogers Place, paid parking will also be in effect from 6:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m. Please see machines or EPark App for more details on hours of operation and hourly rates.

In the fall of 2017, Administration initiated planning of the Muttart Conservatory Rehabilitation Project to determine the Capital rehabilitation investment needs of the facility. Preliminary design work is underway with the facility scheduled for a full public closure to allow the rehabilitation work to start in July 2019 . The work, currently estimated between $11 to 17million, will take approximately 15 to 24 months to complete and the facility will be closed to the public for the full duration. Closing the facility to the public is necessary for both safety and efficiency of delivering the work and aligns with the construction staging plans for Valley Line LRT construction. The full-building closure will include Culina Café, the horticultural pyramids, as well as all bookings, rentals and programs. Recognizing the importance of this facility as a unique Edmonton attraction, a communications plan has been developed with Citizen Services to ensure members, stakeholders, potential visitors, nearby residents and the general public are made aware of any impacts to them and are provided updates on project progress. Project Background Through 2018, a planning exercise was completed to review and analyze the condition of the facility infrastructure, to develop recommendations and priorities for the rehabilitation work, phasing options, schedule and cost estimates. 2 The rehabilitation priorities identified are substantial, with the immediate priority being replacement of 40-year-old electrical, mechanical and structural infrastructure at the end of its service life. As this is a horticultural facility, there is a focus on ensuring that the plants are maintained during replacement of vital facility systems like water, heat and power. Aligning with the Project Development and Delivery Model and the Capital Governance Policy (C591), once the preliminary design has sufficiently advanced, the project budget and schedule will be confirmed and presented to City Council as part of the Spring 2019 Supplementary Capital Budget Adjustment.

To ensure a fair, open, transparent and accountable process for the procurement of this project, a Request for Qualifications (“RFQ”) is scheduled to be issued in March 2019 followed by a Request for Proposals in June 2019. The RFQ will be posted online through BuildWorks Canada and notices will be posted to the Alberta Purchasing Connection. At the February 11, 2019 Executive Committee Meeting, Administration presented the Accountability, Transparency, and Disclosure Framework which outlines the guiding principles for accountability and transparency relating to procurement activities for the Valley Line West and the milestones and opportunities for public disclosure that will be implemented as part of this process. There are some noteworthy components to the procurement process which we would like to draw to your attention: ● A Fairness Monitor has been retained, which is standard procedure with a contract of this complexity and size. The Fairness Monitor provides independent monitoring and oversight of the City’s procurement activities associated with this project. ● A “no lobbying” clause has been included in the RFQ which restricts some actions by potential respondents. For their submissions to be considered, respondents must address all communication, including information requests, to the designated procurement representative named in the RFQ. It is critical that information flow follows the process outlined in the RFQ so that all parties have access to the same information and the City’s Evaluation Team can evaluate the RFQ responses strictly on their content.

DATS has also experienced capacity challenges that have been increasing since January, 2019. The trip accommodation rate has dropped to 95% in recent months, a decrease from the normal 98-99%. In addition to increasing trip demand, DATS experienced a high number of operators retire or exit service. Normal planned operator exits are generally five per year. In the past six months, DATS has had 13 operators exit service (mostly due to retirement), including five in January alone. In response, DATS expedited its spring recruitment to an emergency winter training class. From this class, four operators will be in service in April with an additional four in May. An expanded spring recruitment is also scheduled and will add an additional 15 operators. In the immediate term, DATS has amended its existing contract with Prestige Transportation to allow for delivery of DATS service with contracted sedan taxis. Four new Prestige trained drivers commenced service on March 12th, with ongoing expansion over the next several weeks. Capacity and trip accommodation will improve steadily and is expected to return to historical norms by mid-April. DATS currently has an open tender out for expanded taxi service that may be awarded to multiple providers. This will allow for additional capacity and service flexibility once implemented in August 2019. Beyond addressing capacity issues, there is an ongoing three-tiered review of DATS service that will encompass: ● Customer Engagement - focus groups and workshops to allow DATS users and advocates to identify service challenges and opportunities for customer service improvements. ● Operational Review - provides a review of the use of technology with a focus on trip scheduling requirements to support customer service improvements. ● Program Service Review - will assess DATS’ structure and service model with recommendations for streamlining service efficiency. The work and reviews outlined are being undertaken using a combination of internal City staff along with external providers who have expertise in the areas being assessed. All results will be provided in the June 24th report to Executive Committee, with the intent of delivering Council options for service levels for consideration. The report will also provide options for operational adjustments to facilitate proposed customer service levels and improvements along with identification of any potential budget implications.

On February 26, 2019, the City Market Downtown Board voted to move the Market to a new permanent location at the historic GWG Building (AKA the Army & Navy store or Red Strap Artist Market) in The Quarters located at 10305 - 97 Street. The Board toured its vendors through the new location on Saturday, March 9, 2019. Pending finalization of the lease agreement, the City Market Downtown will share further details on the Market’s relocation, which is anticipated to occur in June 2019. A City Market Downtown is meeting with the Downtown Business Association and the 104 Street Association to share the news. They have tentatively planned to send a news release after those meetings, however news of the move has leaked and is now getting interest on social media. Given the popularity of the Market, the impact on local business owners and revilization of The Quarters, strong media interest is anticipated. City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton is pleased to support the City Market Downtown as they look for a permanent, year-round space that allows the Market to expand and provide additional space for vendors and customers. Key Messages: ● The GWG Building allows the City Market Downtown to have the space needed to expand their market and provides for a year-round, multi-day market. ● The Market has been interested in securing a sustainable, year-round location and the City responded to help facilitate this process. ● The City Market Downtown has a rich history as a vital part of Downtown’s vibrancy and culture. ● Supporting the City Market’s new indoor location contributes to the goals of The Quarters revitalization and the community’s vision for a vibrant neighbourhood. ● Having the City Downtown Market just south of the Royal Alberta Museum brings another major attraction in the area and creates more vibrancy along 97 Street. Approach Downtown City Market will be the primary media contact. City of Edmonton is working with contacts at City Market Downtown, however the Market hasn’t confirmed when they would send the release. Key messages have also been shared. The City of Edmonton will provide interviews with Administration spokespersons upon request to promote positive messaging around Urban Renewal, The Quarters revitalization and the City and community’s vision for a vibrant neighbourhood. Background: The City of Edmonton is leasing the GWG building and has offered the City Market Downtown a sublease for $1, funded through the Community Revitalization Levy. The City Market has been a fixture in downtown Edmonton since 1903. It was a central location from which local and regional farmers could sell their produce and other farm products, and where Edmontonians could shop, socialize and be entertained. Originally located at Market Square, now the site of the Stanley A. Milner Library, the market has established itself as a regular destination every Saturday for Edmontonians. In the mid-1960s, the City Market Downtown relocated to 97th street and 102 avenue to make way for the construction of the city library. In 2004, the City Market moved to 104th street and in the fall of 2011, the City Market Downtown began year-round operations by moving indoors inside City Hall during the winter months and returning outdoors to 104th street in the spring. The new subsidized lease agreement with the City for the GWG Building enables the Market to expand and permanently reside in the building within The Quarters Downtown Community Revitalization Levy area. The building has been vacant since 2007 but has been renovated to accommodate the new purpose. This lease and move allows the City Market Downtown to have a year-round multi-day indoor space with outdoor street and avenue capability for the summer months. The GWG Building is listed on Edmonton’s Inventory of Historic Resources. Built as the Caledonian Department Store in 1911, this commercial building originally situated in the former Namayo Avenue and Clara Street area was converted into a factory by Great Western Garments (GWG) in 1914, and then expanded. GWG initially hired mainly immigrant women into a unionized workplace-at a time when jobs for all women, especially married women, were scarce. Production in the late 1920s was 12,500 garments per year, in WWII 12,500 garments per week, and by the early 1960","y the early 1960s, 12,500 garments per day. In 1955 this building became an Army and Navy store. When this site was renovated and expanded in 1968, A&N employed more than 500 people in Edmonton. The A&N store closed at this location and the building was sold in 2003. The Red Strap Artists Market, named after GWG’s popular 1933 Red Strap brand, operated in the building from 2003 to 2007.

Administration will improve the City’s transfer of ownership documentation by including language that ensures the animal is provided with the appropriate care after the transfer. A finalized process is expected in the coming weeks and Administration will continue to develop and manage a list of potential new owners and organizations who can assist with the transfer of ownership when the need arises.

Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) collaborates extensively with EPS on supporting the safety and security of transit locations throughout the city. For example, our joint efforts involve the presence of uniformed police officers who work alongside Transit Peace Officers to maintain a visible, uniformed presence at transit locations. ETS also has a range of additional security measures, including security guards deployed at 25 transit centres and stations who wear highly visible jackets or vests and patrol throughout their shift. Furthermore, security cameras are installed at all LRT stations, major transit centres, on all buses and LRT cars and some city pedways. EPS and Transit Peace Officers have also added additional joint shifts that focus on high visibility and high incident areas. These new additional joint shifts further complement the EPS LRT Beats team. Transit users and citizens are always encouraged to stay alert, wherever they are, and report situations by talking to a uniformed transit employee, using a blue emergency phone in all transit centres to contact ETS directly, pressing the yellow strips above the windows on LRT cars, or calling 911.

The Blatchford Renewable Energy Utility is founded on a District Energy Sharing System, which will provide environmentally-friendly heating, cooling and domestic hot water to the community. The District Energy Sharing System is one component of Blatchford’s vision of a community that uses 100% renewable energy, is carbon neutral, and significantly reduces its ecological footprint. As a community, Blatchford aligns with several City of Edmonton plans and priorities, as well as the Vision 2050 goals including Climate Resilience. The Implementing the Vision: District Energy booklet has been updated to reflect the new City-owned utility and provide further understanding of Blatchford’s District Energy Sharing System, including a breakdown of Blatchford’s Energy Strategy and how this strategy will help to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the community. The Blatchford District Energy: City Council Decisions document provides an overview of each key decision that was presented at either City Council or a Committee meeting. This includes City Council approvals, development of a Business Case, Utility Fiscal Policy and Business Plan, Rate Filing, and more. A series of videos continue to be released through Blatchford’s social media and web presence to provide further details about the District Energy Sharing System. ● The first video, released in late 2018, provides a live-action, first-hand look at the geo-exchange field under the community’s stormwater pond where the energy will be stored. Expert partners and the City of Edmonton team explain how the energy will be moved from 150 metres below a stormwater pond directly to each home and business in the community. Blatchford District Energy Sharing System 2018 Progress ● The second video of the series provides an overview of Blatchford’s Energy Strategy through animation. The videos will be shared via social media as shorter clips and a longer 3-minute segment to provide a visual understanding of the District Energy Sharing System and what will be different for residents and businesses in Blatchford than in other communities. Blatchford Animated Video Renewable is an award-winning video series through the Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development department. Each video shares a unique story told by local visionaries, creators and leaders with a focus on a sustainable future in Edmonton. ● Edmonton Declaration - interviews Mayor Don Iveson at Blatchford using the community’s vision as an example of Edmonton paving the sustainable way forward. Edmonton Declaration - Renewable ● An earlier video from the Renewable series provides a look at geothermal energy systems, which move energy from under the earth instead of producing it by burning fuel. While the video features the Alfred H. Savage Centre on Fox Drive just east of Whitemud Drive, the technology used is very similar to the type of system is a part of Blatchford’s Energy Strategy. Geothermal Systems - Renewable The Blatchford videos will be released throughout winter and spring 2019 through Blatchford’s social media accounts, e-newsletter and blog at www.BlatchfordEdmonton.com .

We feel it is important to confirm for Council that there will be no changes to the City’s reservation system for food truck operators in 2019. As in past years, food truck operators will continue to be able to reserve spots in EPark zones for their food trucks, at the current parking rates. Furthermore, food truck operators will also be able to purchase a roaming permit that allows them to use any EPark zone for their food truck (except for zones that have been reserved or not permitted). Food truck operators can also choose both options (i.e., have a reserved location and also a roaming permit). We recognize confusion may have been caused for food truck operators as a result of City staff having informally communicated to food truck operators about possible changes to the permitting system. The changes that were being considered by Administration were preliminary, and part of our ongoing review and due diligence related to EPark and food truck operations. Changes to the reservation system for food trucks would not be made without first consulting with food truck operators. To ensure clarity among food truck vendors, Administration will be sending a formal communication to operators next week to ensure they are aware of the City’s guidelines on the permitting system for this summer.

At the May 2, 2018 Community and Public Services Committee meeting, Administration presented CR_5602 Pedestrian Activated Traffic Signals and committed to providing a Q1 update on their review of pedestrian accessibility needs in high pedestrian areas, as well as guidelines to address pedestrian accessibility and safety. Background Historical practices for traffic signaling at Edmonton’s intersections prioritized vehicle movements over pedestrians and other road users. More Edmontonians are using active modes of transportation which has led to greater consideration for the needs of all users. According to the 2015 Edmonton Household Travel Survey, Edmonton residents make an estimated 340,000 daily walking trips (or 113 million walking trips annually), an increase of about 19% from 2005 to 2015. The 2015 daily mode share for walk was 10.8% for Edmonton residents, with an average trip length of 1.1 km. The Downtown, Downtown Fringe, and University areas have the highest number of walking trips, representing one-third of all walk trips. Because Edmontonians are using active modes of transportation, Administration is placing greater consideration on active modes, especially in areas identified as high pedestrian corridors. Guidelines In 2018, Administration drafted guidelines to address pedestrian accessibility and safety at pedestrian-activated signal crossings along Edmonton’s Main Streets (see attached map). Main Streets are identified as areas that are vibrant, walkable, and attractive places. In support of building strong community places, Administration analyzed every pedestrian-activated signal on Edmonton’s Main Streets and found that most (about 75%) are in alignment with the guidelines, ensuring a consistent approach to planning and operating pedestrian-activated traffic signals. The guidelines identify two types of signal control strategies: safety-related and efficiency-related . Safety-related strategies seek to improve safety by reducing or eliminating pedestrian-vehicle conflicts; an example would be the pedestrian scramble intersections. Efficiency-related strategies aim to reduce delays for pedestrians and are usually achieved through signal timing changes. The choice of which strategy to use at an intersection depends on the user characteristics, land use, and roadway geometry. Recognizing there is no one solution that fits all scenarios, aspects of both strategies need to be balanced at certain locations. In addition to this body of work, Administration consulted external stakeholders, such as the Accessibility Advisory Committee (AAC) and Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB), who provided input on these guidelines. The guidelines are in support of the Active Transportation Policy, Vision 2050, and Vision Zero. Next Steps Administration has identified the pedestrian signals that are not in alignment with the guidelines and will take appropriate actions by the end of Q3. The effects of the changes will be monitored and the guidelines will be modified, as necessary. Administration will continue to monitor road user behaviour at intersections and maintain ongoing conversations with the AAC and CNIB, as well as other vested road users. The City of Edmonton is committed to enhance safety for all commuters, improve the pedestrian experience, and minimize travel delays for active modes.

Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) is installing fare validators on five buses in order to determine design, wiring and installation requirements on different types of buses in the fleet. Customers will see these fare validators, but they will not be able to use them because the machines will be inactive. Fare validators will be installed on the entire ETS fleet by spring 2020. Shortly thereafter, pilot testing will begin with a soft launch to the public in late 2020. Customers must use existing payment options to pay their fares before the Smart Fare system is launched. The Regional Smart Fare Electronic Payment System will be rolled out to customers of all public transit systems in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region in the second half of 2020, making it easier for customers to obtain and pay for their rides on public transit across the region. Customers will be able to use a transit fare card, or tap a credit or debit card or other compatible device. Transit customers will be able to set up an “account”, which would allow them to purchase different fare products online, at retail outlets, through a customer call centre or at a new Smart Fare vending machine in LRT stations.

Metro Line Northwest Phase 1 - NAIT to Blatchford Project Delivery Assessment As previously communicated the Metro Line Phase 1 (NAIT to Blatchford) extension was planned to be delivered using a Design-Build method. The project delivery method has been validated to ensure that the original circumstances and assumptions were still valid. Administration has completed this validation work has determined that the Phase 1 extension should be delivered through a Construction Manager method. This determination was based on a project delivery reassessment and accompanying market sounding exercise. A Construction Manager delivery is preferable as it achieves the highest Value for Money, Quality Assurance, and Contract Flexibility. This delivery method also helps to mitigate market conditions risk resulting from several large-scale Design-Build LRT projects, including the Valley Line West, in the Canadian market concurrently. Valley Line Southeast 95 Avenue Closure As early as April 28, 2019, TransEd Partners will be temporarily closing 95 Avenue between 85 Street and 92 Street to vehicles until approximately the end of the 2019 construction season. Pedestrian access will be maintained across 95 Avenue during the closure. The closure will help TransEd to expedite construction on 95 Avenue, where a very tight construction area has made it difficult to advance construction while continuing to keep 1 of 2 the road open. Administration is supportive of the closure, but we appreciate the significant impact the closure will have on the community. TransEd and the City have heard significant concerns from the community about the impact of this closure on businesses and organizations in Strathearn, as well as accessibility concerns for residents with reduced mobility. The City has worked with TransEd to develop plans to address these concerns, including: ● a support plan for businesses which involves advertising, special events, and targeted wayfinding ● an agreement to reopen 95 Avenue between 85 Street and 87 Street as quickly as possible ● a seniors’ accommodation plan which will involve shuttling residents with reduced mobility between bus stops TransEd will lead the execution of these plans, with the City offering support as appropriate. TransEd has committed to continuing to engage the Strathearn community to adjust and refine these plans before and during the closure. They are hosting meetings with affected businesses and the community starting April 11th and members of the City project team will be in attendance. A media event is also scheduled for Friday, April 12 to raise awareness about the closure.

These adjustments are typically made five times a year to accommodate shifts in ridership, customer feedback, and road construction activity. As part of the April 28 service changes, there will be minor seasonal schedule adjustments for bus routes, changes to Routes 7, 8, 15 and 57, and the introduction of Designated Drop-Off Zones at Lewis Farms and South Campus transit centres. Following the end of the winter school term, extra trips will be reduced on bus routes that service post-secondary institutions and some routes will be cancelled until September 2019. To improve efficiencies, Route 57 will be merged into Route 7, which will increase Route 7 frequency between the University of Alberta and downtown. In addition, Routes 7, 8 and 15 will now permanently travel east and west on 104 Avenue between 100 and 105 Street instead of 102A and 103 Avenue. Signage will be displayed at closed stops on 102A and 103 Avenue to direct passengers to their new stop. ETS will pilot new Designated Drop-Off Zones at Lewis Farms and South Campus that will change how buses operate at these transit centres and how signs are displayed at bus bays. All arriving buses will use one of two drop-off zones for all passengers who need to disembark before moving to their own boarding bay to pick up passengers. Additional information, including a full list of bus bay changes, will be available at takeETS.com/projects. For animal lovers across the city, weekend service for Route 594 to the Edmonton Valley Zoo will return on Saturday, May 18. Daily service will begin July 1. Due to ongoing renovations at Fort Edmonton Park, there will be no seasonal service on Route 595. .../2 -2- ETS encourages customers to double check route brochures and use the ETS Transit Trip Planner or real-time tools to see if their route schedule will be adjusted. ETS has enhanced in-app communications by manually adding notification banners to routes affected by these changes. GC/ER/PH/JB/mc c: Linda",,"No",,,

Starting April 16, our automated trucks are collecting carts in the 13 neighborhoods selected to participate in the initial cart rollout. A new way of collecting waste is here! In the past few weeks, approximately 16,000 carts have been delivered to 8,000 participating homes -- one black cart and one green cart for each residence. Participants also received information packages, new collection calendars, and kitchen pails for collecting organic waste inside their home. Canvassers have been knocking on doors in participating neighbourhoods to help answer questions and overcome barriers. Overall, feedback from Edmontonians has indicated that they are willing to do more to help increase waste diversion. And now, our program begins! Edmontonians will start to see our automated trucks moving through neighbourhoods to collect the carts. We know there will be many questions and a lot to learn from this rollout, and Waste Services will continually collect feedback to help evaluate the program. Our social marketing teams, Waste Hotline staff, and 311 team are ready to help residents as they begin to use their carts and learn the new program. Residents are also encouraged to use the WasteWise app at edmonton.ca/wastewiseapp to help determine what waste goes where. The Waste Hotline can be reached at 780-496-5678.

As a result of citizen and Council input, Administration will be consulting with interested stakeholders to create a Vision Zero Advocacy Group and an associated Terms of Reference. This group may include community interest groups and members of the public who are interested in providing insight into traffic safety programs. The group will report directly to the Branch Manager of Parks and Roads Services. A meeting will be held on a quarterly basis to discuss progress and updates. At the direction of Committee, Administration is currently working on developing and finalizing the framework and implementation plan to reduce the speed limit on local residential roads. At the April 24, 2019, Community and Public Services Committee meeting, Administration will present two approaches to complete this work: 1. Create a Charter bylaw that would lower the default speed limit to 40 km/h 2. Amend the existing Speed Zones Bylaw 6894 to include all local residential roads. Both options have cost implications for signage, planning, timelines, communication, and public engagement. To better understand which roads could be impacted by a reduction to the speed limit on residential roads, maps of each ward are attached with the following information: ● 50 km/h Local Residential Roads (green) - Roads that could be affected by a motion to reduce the speed limit to 40 km/h ● 50 km/h Roads (in red) - Roads that are currently posted at 50 km/h but would not be affected as they are not identified as local residential roads (e.g. collector roads) Please contact Brian Simson, Branch Manager of Parks and Roads Services at brian.simpson@edmonton.ca if you have any questions or concerns.

The Advanced Energy Research Facility (AERF) was built in conjunction with the biofuels facility as a pilot scale plant capable of testing and gasification of various feedstocks. As a built asset, it has the potential to enable further research and development and commercialization activities. As part of the effort to address the AERF's utility, the City of Edmonton, has partnered with CanmetENERGY, Natural Resources Canada, the University of Alberta and lnnoTech Alberta to form a project under the banner of the Alberta Clean Energy Technology Accelerator (ACETA). ACETA has received approval of $4 million in funding from Alberta Innovates (Al) through the Climate Change Innovation and Technology Framework (CCITF)'s Clean Technology Facilities Support Program that will be released soon. As the lead funder, Alberta Innovates (Al) may choose to make a public announcement about this grant in the future. We will alert you if this is to happen. ACETA is being developed for the innovation community, including technology developers, post-secondary institutions, industry and other stakeholders such as small municipalities. ACETA provides access to resources and feedstocks such as processed Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and biomass, syngas from municipal solid waste residuals, landfill gas, anaerobic digestion gas and other processed materials or by-products from solid waste processing and conversion. It also provides access to technology for hydrocarbon processing, upgrading and refining as well as experimentation and technology development. Each ACETA partner is contributing cash and in-kind contributions towards the ACETA initiative and a major goal for the initiative is to transform Al's seed funding into sustainable commercialization activity that leverages existing feedstocks and assets into long term economic benefit. .. .12 -2- The CCITF's contribution for ACETA will be used at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre to: • Upgrade the biological and waste characterization labs • Develop biogas and syngas sampling stations as well as transport and storage systems • Upgrade municipal solid waste (MSW) and refuse derived fuel (RDF) densification and resizing pilot plant at Advanced Energy Research Facility (AERF) • Develop new technology incubation pods • To reduce power demand charges at AERF either through Micro generation or through switching power source of AERF to Alternative energy power on site. • To support the overall partnership to develop a long-term sustainable structure. Over the coming months, our team from Waste Services will be working with our partners to initiate our base projects and to begin to plan for the longer term in terms of structure and support. All efforts wi ll be made to ensure that our participation continues to leverage our existing assets and to align with our strategic goals in support of climate resilience and regional prosperity. About Climate Change Innovation and Technology Framework (CCITF): CCITF funds numerous projects across Alberta, in these priority sector areas: cleaner oil and gas; methane emissions reduction; low carbon electricity; waste to value-added; green buildings and energy efficiency.

Administration continues to refine processes in order to strike the right balance between helping those experiencing homelessness, protecting public lands, and providing access to parks and the river valley for all users. Administration works with Boyle Street Community Services and Bissell Centre Outreach teams to connect individuals who are living rough with housing. Once encampments are triaged and deemed vacated by Park Rangers, City crews are deployed to clean up the vacant encampments. Outreach According to the “By Name List” coordinated by Homeward Trust, 1,923 people were experiencing homelessness in January 2019, 486 of these individuals were unsheltered, or sleeping rough. Ninety-five percent of the unsheltered population in January 2019 were experiencing physical, mental, and/or substance related health conditions. In the first quarter of 2019, Boyle Street Outreach team worked with 113 unique individuals who were living rough, made 212 contacts with housing providers, and housed 17 individuals. Clean Up As of April 30, city crews have cleaned over 130 encampments in 2019 to date, removing approximately 47,300 kg of material and 3,576 needles. Not all of these sites are unique, as encampments can be quickly re-occupied post clean-up. Additional staff are assisting to address a backlog of 90 inspected, vacant encampments located throughout the city. From May 1 to August 30, 2019, Downtown Proud! will have two dedicated employees to pick up litter and debris from encampment activity at the top of the bank along Jasper Avenue from 82 Street to 92 Street. Though an encampment may appear abandoned, occupants may be actively working with Street Outreach teams or it may still be active in the evenings only. Other times, individuals will move into previously abandoned encampments. In all cases, these instances impact timelines for clean up. In some instances, dumpsters and machinery are required to clean up large or hard-to-reach encampments. Some encampments were identified in winter; however, they are only now safe for staff to access and clean. Next Steps On May 8, Administration is bringing forward a report to the Community and Public Services Committee entitled “Interim Housing”. The report presents the current state of homeless encampments in Edmonton and provides information on how the current response can be improved. The Homeless on Public Lands Committee is currently developing an updated vision and strategy. The Committee includes representatives from Administration, Alberta Health Services, Edmonton Police Service, Homeward Trust, Boyle Street Community Services, Bissell Centre, REACH Edmonton, and several others. Homeward Trust, a critical partner in this work, is piloting a new outreach housing project in partnership with Boyle Street Community Services and the Bissell Centre. In response to the severity and range of health challenges present in people sleeping rough outdoors, this team will focus intensively on the population staying outdoors who require frequent and consistent contact with housing workers to become housed. Continuing Efforts Administration and the City’s partner agencies actively identify encampments during day to day operations or coordinated patrols. However, citizen reports to 311 provide additional information that can help inform coordinated responses to effectively deliver supports or assistance to those who are experiencing homelessness and to arrange for clean up services. From January 1 to April 25, 2019, the City received 633 reports to 311 on homeless encampments. Of those, there are 90 outstanding encampments scheduled for inspection before they can be cleaned up. There are new encampments identified daily that need to be cleaned up. The City will continue to provide information regarding clean up operations as a part of the weekly Parks and Roads Services update to City Council. Edmontonians are encouraged to phone 311 if they notice a homeless encampment or observe any illegal activity.

Muttart Crossing Development around Stadium Station - Partial LRT closures From May 18 - 20, buses will replace LRT all day between Clareview and Churchill. This partial LRT closure is the first of three planned closures for the City’s Transit-Oriented Development south of Stadium Station. On May 18, buses will run every 5 minutes until 7 p.m., then every 7-8 minutes from 7 p.m. until the end of service. On May 19 and 20, buses will run every 7-8 minutes. Before 5:30 a.m. and after 12:35 a.m., buses will run every 15 minutes.

The Valley Line West project is currently in procurement and we expect to have a contractor on board and begin construction by Summer of 2020. As part of our preparations for construction, various Early Works projects have now begun and will continue up until construction of the line. Early Works include tree removals and building removals along the LRT alignment, as well as underground utility relocations. We are working with various project partners to carry out this work. This includes EPCOR water work on Stony Plain Road between 149 to 151 Streets beginning May 23 and lasting approximately four weeks. Crews will also begin tree removals on vacant residential properties owned by the City along the alignment, including in the Glenora neighbourhood. Further EPCOR utility work is planned for the downtown core in the areas of 106 Street, 103 Avenue and 104 Avenue, beginning in June and continuing through August. The project team will provide ongoing updates about this work on the City of Edmonton’s Valley Line West project page at edmonton.ca/valleylinewest . We are raising public awareness about these Early Works via roadway signs, emails to our project subscription list, notices through the City’s social media channels and website and, in some cases, in-person notification or hand-delivered notices.

To minimize impact and provide consistency for ETS customers, the Eaux Claires Transit Centre will be utilized for the entirety of the football and concert season at Commonwealth Stadium from May 26 to November 24. As a result, Eaux Claires Transit Center will be added as a Park & Ride location for Edmonton Eskimos games and other events at Commonwealth Stadium. Eaux Claires Park & Ride has greater capacity to park vehicles and has connections with regular transit routes for the convenience of our customers. This will also be an opportunity to service the north central part of the City which has seen substantial development in recent years. Further, Edmonton Eskimo ticket holders have the price of the transit fare included in their ticket to the event.

Over the years, there has been consistent interest by Edmontonians to access these programs. To date, Benchmark has received donations for over 700 benches, Legacy for 27 benches, and Commemorative Tree for approximately 300 trees. In August 2018, following feedback expressed by donors regarding the clarity of term length, the commemorative programs were placed under review. This memo provides an update on the progress of the review and next steps. Program Review Progress Summary During the fall and winter 2018, Administration completed a review of its commemorative programs including financial analysis, a jurisdictional scan, internal stakeholder engagement, and an assessment of our implementation practices. Internal subject matter experts in finance, law, and operations have provided valuable insight into the challenges, risks and mitigation strategies associated with the City of Edmonton’s commemorative programs. Administration's review highlighted three areas which needed to be addressed prior to bringing recommendations for the commemorative program back to City Council: ● Completing adequate public engagement ● Doing a more fulsome financial analysis which included looking at the bench design and material used. ● Bylaw 16620 requiring any contract greater than 10 years to be approved by City Council. Administration will present term length options to City Council for review and approval. Further internal engagement, public engagement, financial analysis, and a deeper jurisdictional review are underway. Financial Analysis and Jurisdictional Review A long term financial analysis of the commemorative programs is being conducted to accurately calculate the costs of maintenance and installation of the commemorative items. A jurisdictional review is also underway in order to compare similar programs as well as alternative bench designs and materials with other municipalities. Findings will be analyzed and may be presented as options during public engagement. Engagement Administration is committed to actively engaging with existing donors and the broader public to ensure the program review incorporates the needs of interested stakeholders and the City of Edmonton. A pillar of the engagement strategy developed for this review is to re-establish trust with existing and new donors to the commemorative programs. Public engagement will commence in summer 2019 and will inform the recommendation presented to City Council on updates to the program. The results of the public engagement will also assist Administration in making decisions on future program components, such as the locations where commemorative items can be installed, bench design and materials, and the addition of new types of commemorative items. Next Steps Administration is considering the development of a proposal to unify the commemorative programs and the public facing intake of all donations. Further engagement efforts will inform the approach. Administration will report to City Council in Q4 of 2019 to seek a decision on the term length of existing and future donations, with the intention of relaunching the application process shortly thereafter.

The final draft network incorporated public input gathered in spring 2018, which ETS used to refine the proposed route designs. Comments shared by the public last fall have been compiled into a public-facing What We Heard and Did report (see Attachment 1). During the fall community engagement process, more than 2,700 Edmontonians participated in drop-in workshops and other stakeholder engagement activities. The City also received 3,500 completed online surveys. The What We Heard reports will be published on edmonton.ca/newbusroutes and distributed through the project’s citizen mailing list in the next week. Some feedback highlights included: ● General satisfaction with proposed frequencies; however, citizens’ satisfaction was somewhat dependent on where they lived. Some people living in outer areas would like more frequent buses, particularly in off-peak hours. ● Majority of participants agreed the proposed network provides access to major destinations, is more efficient and makes better use of City resources. ● Some outer area customers continue to have concerns about the network’s coverage in their area. ● Transit customers are concerned about the amount of time it will take to make transfers in the new system, based on their experience with the current system. First/Last Kilometre Engagement In order to improve connectedness to public transit, BNR is complemented by the first kilometre/last kilometre project that will identify alternative transit options for communities that have walking distances of more than 600 metres to fixed transit service. In January 2019, Council expanded the scope of the first kilometre/last kilometre pilot project to include all communities that would benefit from alternative transit service as part of proposed BNR and communities that have never had regular transit service but might qualify for alternative transit service. ETS will focus its initial public engagement efforts on the communities that would benefit from alternative transit service as part of proposed BNR. Five sessions will take place in late June and ETS will be asking residents to help refine a proposed alternative transit option to ensure it meets their needs. Please see Appendix 1 for details. Residents will be notified via direct mail, social media and roadside signs. An online survey also will be available after the workshops have concluded to gather feedback from residents who are unable to attend the workshops. A report about this public engagement will accompany the first kilometre/last kilometre challenge report in November 2019 with potential solutions to connect communities with public transit. The BNR report, as well as a report about the first kilometre/last kilometre transit solution, will be presented to the Urban Planning Committee in November 2019. As part of our ongoing commitment to inform City Council on the various programs and projects that make up the delivery of the Transit Strategy, Administration will be providing two reports to Community and Public Services Committee on June 24. The first report, Principles of Services for DATS - Contracted Service, Pickup Time and Impact of Snow and Ice Policy (CR_6537), will provide an update in regards to program improvements to DATS. The second report, Interim Update on Ridership Recovery and Growth Plan (CR_7029), will provide an update on how Administration will assess factors such as customer experience and service delivery to support ridership recovery and growth.

Eng., Deputy City Manager","Edmonton Composting Facility",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nPo-69Auydw32DPeGqWDajanS2nh23TB)","The Edmonton Composting Facility (ECF) has been in operation on the Edmonton Waste Management Site since 2000. The facility is used to aerobically process organic waste for the City of Edmonton. In late 2017, critical structural issues associated with the roof were identified and Waste Services implemented mitigation and risk management activities to continue use of the facility in a safe manner. These activities included engagement of expert advice to implement structural improvements, routine monitoring, a three-dimensional scan of roof deflection, safe work procedures and winter shut-downs. To date, these activities have allowed Waste Services to maintain the safe operation of the facility. The eventual shutdown of the ECF has been anticipated since 2017, when structural issues were identified and brought to Council’s attention. Waste Services intended to conditionally operate the Edmonton Compost Facility until fall of 2021 based on regular assessments of the safety of the facility. In Spring 2019, an investigation of the facility, complete with a pre-scheduled three-dimensional scan to measure and compare the change in deflection of the roof, indicated that conditions in the facility have deteriorated. Upon review of this information, Waste Services, in collaboration with internal and external structural engineers, has concluded it is no longer safe to continue to operate the ECF. Given this conclusion, Administration will begin the process to shut down and decommission the facility. In the short term, organics processing capacity will be partially directed to the Anaerobic Digestion Facility (ADF) which is undergoing commissioning processes that will continue into Q3 2019. Regardless, without access to the ECF, the City’s overall organics processing capacity will be reduced immediately. The shut down of the ECF will have some short term implications including: ● Priority access to organics processing at the ADF will be reserved for the single family units, including the 8,000 source separated demonstration phase homes and those Commercial clients who are able to provide source separated materials for organic processing at the ADF. ● Of the approximately 1,000 Waste Services commercial customers, 60 are considered climate leaders who utilize our program as part of their overall environmental initiative. If materials from these customers cannot meet ADF standards, Waste Services will work with each client to identify alternate solutions where possible. ● Waste Services will be working with contractors directly affected by the shut-down of the ECF to assist in transitions they may need to undertake with their staff and operations. The continued operation of the ECF was always contingent on the ability to operate it safely, and the City’s Organic’s Processing Strategy recommended a technology transition to anaerobic digestion. Accomplishing this strategy requires replacing the ECF with an expansion of the ADF to increase capacity to service the City of Edmonton long term organic processing needs. The current Organics Processing Facilities work is aimed at providing a long-term substitute for the ECF. The need to replace the ECF is factored into forthcoming reports on the 2020-2023 Business Plan and 25 Year Waste Strategy Update in late June.

The proposed land is immediately adjacent to Fort Edmonton Park. The lease agreement would see the land leased to Fort Edmonton Management Company (FEMCo) who would sublease the land to Alta-Fab Structures Ltd. (Alta-Fab) to build and operate the spa. No formal proposal has been presented to Administration, nor has project planning for the spa started. This report asks Council for approval to proceed with this lease agreement to give FEMCo and Alta-Fab access to the land in order to proceed to the planning phase. On May 29, 2019, Dub Architects and the newly formed Edmonton Nordic Spa released a statement to the media. The statement announced a spa in the heart of Edmonton, including spa amenities and construction timelines. The statement did not include a specific location. Media coverage to date has not included the location. No public engagement was conducted for this proposal report as it is not a requirement of lease negotiations. Public engagement will be an important consideration for the Land Development Applications that will follow, should Council approve the leasing proposal. Two things should be noted: 1. Another Nordic spa, west of Edmonton in Parkland , was announced publicly on May 23 . This is one of the reasons for expedited timelines. Messaging may be needed to differentiate. 2. FEMCo currently manages the land in question. FEMCo initiated this lease agreement with Administration. City of Edmonton Position: Administration is presenting a report to Executive Committee on June 10 outlining a land lease agreement for a Nordic spa in the Edmonton River Valley. The proposed land is immediately adjacent to Fort Edmonton Park. This report seeks Council approval of the proposed land lease, which is essential to provide the proponents security in having access to the land. Planning and public engagement would begin in a subsequent phase. At this stage, no formal site planning has begun. The proposed land is owned by the City and managed by Fort Edmonton Management Company. This company is responsible for managing Fort Edmonton Park and a portion of the River Valley surrounding it, including the proposed land. In the lease terms, Fort Edmonton Management Company would sublease the land to Alta-Fab Ltd. Key Messages: Administration is proposing a land lease agreement with Fort Edmonton Management Company enable a Nordic spa development to two acres of the Edmonton River Valley. The proposed land is immediately adjacent to Fort Edmonton Park and currently managed by Fort Edmonton Management Company. This report seeks Council approval for a land lease . If approved, the lease agreement would provide the proprietor with security in having access to the land , which enables public engagement activities to occur. Formalized land development applications will commence in a subsequent phase . This will include public engagement The Nordic spa would be constructed and managed by Alta-Fab Structures Ltd. and is proposed to contain heated and cold pools , saunas, steam and massage rooms , a cafe and a full-sized restaurant , among other amenities. The spa is intended to increase tourism in the city and enhance and complement existing cultural facilities , like Fort Edmonton Park. The annual lease fee reflects market value. This amount will be adjusted every five years to reflect current market value. Approach: Due to the City's position as landlord, Communications will manage media inquiries as they come in surrounding the land lease (FCS). If subsequent phases commence, we will also answer questions on zoning (UFCSD) and River Valley use (Citizen Services) The proprietor and partner organization may hold media events and distribute additional statements. Background: The City holds a consolidation agreement with Fort Edmonton Management Company (FEMCo) outling FEMCO's management of Fort Edmonton Park and the surrounding area, including the lands in question This consolidation agreement has been in place since 2009. The consolidation agreement stipulates that a third party cannot manage or lease the land -the reason a lease agreement is needed to build the spa. The proposed land is raw land, meaning it is not currently serviced nor zoned to support the operations of a spa. This will be a component of the planning phase to come.

As a result, Administration is focusing on one deployment for now, along the 101 Street corridor. That experience will influence the decision to pursue testing at a second location. Pilot Work is underway to implement an adaptive traffic signal pilot to evaluate the technology and its impacts on pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The initial deployment of this technology will use the City’s existing central traffic management system to minimize costs and simplify implementation. Currently, Administration is working on agreements with a vendor for software installation and upgrades to the central traffic management system. Deployment of detection hardware began in April 2019 at the pilot intersections along 101 Street. In order for the traffic signals to operate in an adaptive manner, pedestrian push buttons are required for all signals on the corridor. As the pilot corridor includes intersections with high pedestrian activity, Administration will trial an automatic pedestrian detection system to negate the need for people to push a walk button to cross the street. The adaptive corridor will be fully operational in late summer 2019 once the software agreements are finalized. Testing will continue into the fall to evaluate impacts during periods of heavier traffic: frequent Rogers Place events and the start of the school year. Installation and evaluation are planned using existing funding from the Traffic Controller Conversion capital profile. Evaluation Impacts of the pilot will be evaluated based on performance measures compared to the current conventional signal operation in the corridor and intersecting roadways. The evaluation will include review of: ● Motorist travel times ● Vehicle queues ● Vehicle volume count ● Signal coordination (vehicle arrival on greenlights) ● Pedestrian service frequency ● Public and stakeholder feedback Administration will evaluate these measures during typical traffic patterns as well as during highly variable traffic periods, such as before and after arena events. The results of this evaluation will inform the strategy for further deployment of this technology. Next Steps Administration will provide updates over the course of the pilot and will present full results of the pilot to Urban Planning Committee in March 2020 .

Citizen Services will be providing responses to each of the inquiries and wanted to provide you all with a general update. On Tuesday, June 4, 2019, City staff attended a town hall meeting regarding the Keheewin development which consists of multi-family mixed-income affordable housing on a surplus school site. This public information meeting was arranged by the developer, Capital Region Housing and their consultant Stantec. City staff were present to answer questions from the public regarding guidelines for the development of surplus school sites and the City’s role in the development of affordable housing. At the town hall meeting, a number of the questions raised were quite specific, technical, and covered a range of topics. In order to respond to each query comprehensively, Administration committed to providing residents of Keheewin with written responses to any questions that could not be addressed at the town hall. Additionally, members of the public have submitted written inquiries on this matter, with three letters sent on behalf of a group of residents having been received to date and more expected. Administration is consulting with Capital Region Housing, Stantec, and Edmonton Public Schools to provide comprehensive and integrated responses to citizen’s correspondence regarding the Keheewin site. Administration will work to respond to each citizen as quickly as possible and has acknowledged receipt of every letter that has been submitted to date.

The City of Edmonton is committed to providing citizens with safe, clean, and secure outdoor pool facilities for all citizens to enjoy during Edmonton’s late-spring and summer months. To maintain this standard, each outdoor pool undergoes a pre-opening spring inspection and start-up to ensure all mechanical, electrical, and structural systems function as expected. During Oliver Pool’s spring start-up, several leaks were discovered in the pool’s drain pipe. To further investigate, sections of the basin concrete floor were cut out to expose the pipe. A total of three leaks were repaired. To complete the work, the basin floor must be patched with concrete and the electrical bonding of the basin rebar re-established. Facility Maintenance Services has taken the lead on detailing the repair requirements and will execute the work which will take approximately three months to complete due to curing time of the concrete and coating. With the 2019 season ending on September 7, we will not be opening Oliver Pool this summer. During the closure, we encourage Edmontonians to take advantage of the other outdoor pools open this season: ● Mill Creek Outdoor Pool – 9555 - 84 Avenue ● Fred Broadstock Outdoor Pool – 15720 - 105 Avenue ● Queen Elizabeth Outdoor Pool (opens June 8) – 9170 Walterdale Hill ● Borden Natural Swimming Pool (opens late June) – 7615 Borden Park Road Communication to the public will be done through web notification, Facebook, and email sent to the Oliver Community League.

I’d like to thank the Mayor and Council for taking the time to recognize City staff and their contributions to keeping our City operational and open for business. We are extremely optimistic as we continue to see business owners and retail outlets doing the right thing and self-managing without the need for enforcement. Grocery store operators are adding special times and lines for seniors, using social media for stocking updates, limiting bulk purchases, holding pricing and ensuring access to a reasonable number of customers to maintain social distancing. Additionally, last night’s check of 90 businesses by bylaw enforcement officers found a small number of bars open that immediately shut down voluntarily when informed of new provincial orders under the Public Health Emergency. Restaurants visited were voluntarily complying with new mandatory patron counts. We are working diligently to address Council, business and citizen questions surrounding a number of issues including: continued recalibration of transit services; impacts of federal and provincial financial aid for individuals, businesses, and our vulnerable population; senior support; reduction or elimination of fees and taxes; and how to best communicate changes with citizens and business owners. Regarding support for City staff who require family related leave, we continue to review the currently available options and make adjustments as necessary. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the eleven indicators and whether there is a need to declare a state of local emergency (SOLE). Following today’s meeting of the Emergency Advisory Committee, it was agreed that the COVID-19 Task Team has the needed powers to work effectively and there is not currently a need to give the Emergency Management Agency additional powers of authority by declaring a SOLE. We are not there yet. We are working closely with Alberta Health Services and all levels of government to monitor the public health emergency and will continually adjust our approach based on the latest information. We are continuing to work with the City’s Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to determine roles and responsibilities. While the exact reporting structure is being finalized, we have mutually agreed that the EOC will direct immediate operational needs while the Task Team will continue to focus on strategic direction, recommendations and decision making. We are also in daily contact with the Provincial Operations Centre (POC) to ensure that our approach to emergency management aligns with provincial needs under the Public Health Emergency. In order to ensure continued city operations, we are closely examining options for staff redeployments, transit routes, service counters and numerous other core areas of business. These decisions remain fluid and we will continue to keep you apprised of significant changes that may impact citizens or City employees. Looking Ahead We will continue to monitor the situation with federal and provincial funding, Alberta Health Services, and the City’s Emergency Operations Centre.

Bidders have until August 7 to submit their proposals, and the successful bidder will be awarded the contract following the review process. While this RFP is open, it will remain “business as usual” at the Construction and Demolition Recycling Facility. This RFP is consistent with Council’s February 1, 2019 decision to seek an operator for the Construction and Demolition operations at the EWMC, which was made based on a market scan and a Request for Expressions of Interest (RFEOI). The intent to seek an operational partner for the business follows a 2018 assessment of the Construction and Demolition Recycling Facility by the Program and Services Review team. This resulted in recommendations to improve the potential viability of the business by seeking an operating partner who will be better positioned to improve market performance. By reaching out to the private sector, Waste Services hopes to continue providing construction and demolition recycling services to industrial, commercial and institutional customers, while achieving better diversion and improving the bottom line. Construction and Demolition Recycling is one line of non-regulated business currently offered by the City. The decision to pursue this RFP is anticipated in the forthcoming strategy and will not be impacted by the broader proposed Waste Strategy, which will be discussed at Utility Committee on June 28.

Administration has rolled out 23 new and improved safe needle disposal boxes. To date, nine existing boxes have been replaced with new ones and another 10 were added in areas where data indicated a need for one. The remaining four old yellow boxes will be replaced shortly. The new design is safer, more durable and easier to install. All new installations are on public property. Needle boxes historically located on private property will remain where they are if the data continues to support the need for one. These needle box locations will be reviewed and assessed annually to ensure they are collecting an adequate number of needles. Based on actual needle collection data gathered from each box, the location may need to be moved to a more suitable location. To assist Edmontonians in finding where to dispose of needles safely, the City has developed an interactive map that shows the locations of the needle disposal boxes and eco stations. This map complements the other two maps unveiled in January of this year which show the number of calls to 311 for needle pick up and the numbers of needles collected. To see all three needle-related maps, visit edmonton.ca/needlemap. Key highlights: ● A public information campaign was launched in May and includes a revamped information guide on safe needle collection and disposal at edmonton.ca/needles. ● The first quarterly update of the numbers of needles collected show the City continues to see the highest rates of needle collection within the core of the city, with the highest rates in Downtown, Alberta Avenue, Spruce Avenue, Oliver, Central McDougall and McCauley. ● Various City operational business areas are testing a new app to better track needles found and collected by City field staff to year end. An assessment of this app and tracking process will be conducted in January 2020 and further refinements will be made as required. Edmontonians who encounter a needle on public property are encouraged to call 311. Our goal is to have needles collected within two hours of the call between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., seven days a week.

The building was added to the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton in 2017, as part of the Glenora Historic Resources Inventory Project. Built in 1953, the Podersky Residence is valued for its association with the development of the historic Capital Hill subdivision, a section now part of the Glenora Neighbourhood. This area was originally subdivided in 1907 from the land holdings of Ontario-born John B. Gardiner, which extended south to Mackenzie Ravine. Only a handful of lots were sold, and the real estate collapse of 1914 ended Gardiner’s ambitions for his upscale Capital Hill community. The City of Edmonton obtained 73% of the Capital Hill properties north of MacKinnon Ravine, allowing it to replot this area in 1930, establishing the present route of Ravine Drive. The resulting subdivision was nearly as unsuccessful as Gardiner’s original vision: by 1948 there were only 11 privately-owned lots, and only a single dwelling erected west of 136 Street along Ravine Drive. A second replotting scheme was proposed in 1948, and between 1949 and 1951, the City acquired the few privately owned parcels to once again replot the area. The new subdivision, staked by surveyor Alexander G. Stewart, drew upon concepts of the adjacent historic Garden City Suburb in Glenora, as well as the more contemporary Neighbourhood Unit in which Noel Dant, Edmonton’s new Town Planner, advocated. The effort proved fruitful and by 1954, coupled with the Post-War Boom, nearly the entire Capital Hill area had been developed, including the Podersky Residence. The Podersky Residence is further valued as an intact, well-crafted and distinctive example of the Contemporary Modern home style in Capital Hill. This style of architecture is characterized by houses designed with long, linear profiles, flat roofs, single storey massing and use of natural materials such as wood and stone that integrate the building into the natural environment. The typical single-storey massing of the buildings allows the mature vegetation in the area to be the prominent feature, rather than the buildings themselves. Additional Contemporary elements found in the Podersky Residence include its wide overhanging eaves, recessed front entrance and extended roof overhang. The attached garage, sited prominently in the design reflects the shift to automobile culture that reigned in the post-war climate. The residence was built for Louis and Anna Podersky by local contractor Michael Stashko at a cost of $20,000. Louis (1893-1976) immigrated as an infant with his family from Chicago to the Lacombe area. At 12-years old, he left for Edmonton where he worked as a drayman, transporting furniture from the train station. Louis began operating a furniture auction house and in 1912, a used furniture store on Nanaimo Avenue (97 Street today). In 1915, he and Anna Pollack (1895-1989) married and they would go on to have four children together. Louis later bought Greenfield's Furniture Exchange on 98 Street and Jasper Avenue, renaming it Podersky Furniture Exchange. His enterprise grew and he began selling new furniture, renaming his venture Crescent Furniture. In 1934, the business expanded into a four-storey commercial building along 101 Street. Louis continued to expand his dealings in the furniture business, eventually passing it along to his son, Daniel who sold it in 1972. The property is zoned (RF1) Low Density Residential. The owner has applied to subdivide the parcel into two new parcels to facilitate the development of two new single detached dwellings. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner's consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent.

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. The Warnock-Hersey Ltd. Building, is a one story stucco clad commercial building with a low pitch, front facing gable roof behind a boomtown front with a stepped parapet. This commercial building is an important historic resource due to its association with the theme of post-oil boom development in Ritchie. The one-story structure was built in 1957, two years after the end of the oil boom in Alberta. Although the boom had ended, Edmonton’s population continued to grow due to an influx of workers and the continued development of the oil industry. The building’s first tenant, Warnock-Hersey Limited, sold building supplies and no doubt benefited from post-oil boom construction. While the Warnock-Hersey Ltd. Building sat vacant for the past 20 years, and appears to retain architectural integrity, it is in poor condition. The property owner is seeking to demolish the building instead of bringing the building back to its original condition. The owner has been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the building as a Municipal Historic Resource, which was declined.

The Valley Line Southeast is currently under construction and the Valley Line West and Metro Line Northwest Phase One programs are preparing to begin construction in 2020. Building this transformational infrastructure inevitably causes some disruption. We recognize this and do what we can to minimize LRT construction impacts on Edmontonians. However, it can still be challenging for some to see past the relatively short-term inconvenience of construction and support the long-term benefits of LRT expansion. LRT Expansion and Renewal is initiating a research-based education campaign that uses storytelling to raise awareness and educate Edmontonians about the benefits of LRT expansion, especially in areas impacted by construction. The campaign will launch June 19 and will run through September, prime time for Valley Line Southeast construction and Valley Line West construction preparations. The campaign will share three authentic stories from Edmontonians who are excited about where LRT expansion will take them (#wherewillyougo) The three storytelling videos have been uploaded onto the City’s YouTube channel ( Mark , Ian , Jones family ) and shared on social media, posts, conversations and blogs about LRT expansion. We will be encouraging other Edmontonians to share their stories on social media about where LRT expansion will take them through a small contest. Attached are samples of the campaign posters that will be installed on trains, in LRT stops and in Churchill Square. LRT is an important investment in Edmonton’s future and this campaign is part of that investment. This campaign will increase understanding and excitement about why we’re building LRT by sharing positive experiences. Please don’t hesitate to contact Pamela Hnytka if you have further questions about the campaign: pam.hnytka@edmonton.ca or 780-442-1507.

The working relationship between the City and Northlands has been constructive and we’ll continue to work together leading up to and throughout K-Days. K-Days kicks off on Friday, July 19, with the annual parade through downtown Edmonton beginning at 10 a.m. Events at the Exhibition Lands begin at noon on July 19 and run until Sunday, July 28. Edmonton will also be playing host to the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour Edmonton Open , which is being held at the Exhibition Lands from July 17 to 21. The final rounds and medal matches will overlap with K-Days. Administration has been working closely with Volleyball Canada, the event promoter, and Northlands to host beach volleyball players from around the world including the Canadian women’s team which is ranked number one in the world. These aren’t the only events taking place over this weekend. Administration has been busy supporting Taste of Edmonton (July 18-28) in its alternate location at the Alberta Legislature grounds while construction continues in the Civic Precinct.

The amending agreement considers the extension of the Mayfair’s lease from 2051 to 2069 and requires the club to provide elements of public access. Recently, questions have arisen, both from the media and residents, as to whether the Mayfair is honouring these new access terms. The following provides further information and an update on the status of the amending agreement: ● The lease amending agreement, including increased public access terms, is still being negotiated. Until such a time as the agreement is finalized, the current lease terms apply. ● The lease amending agreement will formalize seasonal, public use for cross country skiing from December 1 to March 31 each year. ● The amending agreement also requires that 7.5% of annual rounds of golf are played by non-members, but is not prescriptive on how that is achieved. This allows the Mayfair to operationally decide how to meet these requirements with the exception that the required rounds can not include those played by members or tournament players. ● Both additions are consistent with the access terms found in the Highlands Golf Course lease agreement, which Council directed Administration to use as a foundation for the Mayfair lease amendments. ● The lease amending agreement is based on current market value. ● Lease amending agreement negotiations have been complex. Mayfair shareholder concurrence for lease amendment terms will be sought in July. If supported, the lease amending agreement is expected to be finalized in August.

Its main focus is on landlords that exploit vulnerable people and the effect that these properties have on neighbourhoods. CBC or other media may have follow-up questions for Council members or Administration. City of Edmonton Position: This podcast describes in great depth the effect of problem landlords on neighbourhoods, which underscores the City’s message that affordable housing is needed for many vulnerable Edmontonians. Key Messages: ● Safe, well-managed affordable housing can help revitalize neighbourhoods. ● Clean, safe, well-managed affordable housing reduces health care and justice costs. ● Affordable housing is one of EndPovertyEdmonton’s six game changers. ● The City of Edmonton is one of many agencies working hard to help tackle issues that arise from homelessness, crime and disorder and problem properties. ● The City of Edmonton is working with partner agencies to address high risk properties from a number of angles though the Residential Living Governance Committee (RLGC). ● The RLGC has had many successes since its inception in early 2018. As of June 28, 2019, the RLGC has conducted 206 joint inspections and improved conditions at 90 high-risk properties. Approach : IMC will monitor media coverage for spin-off stories and track reactions to these stories on social media. Background: ● The Residential Living Governance Committee (RLGC) is a multi-agency body that works together to provide a coordinated approach to solving issues at high risk properties involving vulnerable individuals, families and places. ● RLGC agencies include Alberta Health Services, Edmonton Police Service, the Government of Alberta Solicitor General, Ministry of Labour and several areas within the City of Edmonton including Fire Rescue Services, Safety Codes Compliance, Development Compliance, Community Standards and Housing and Homelessness. ● CBC has been working on this podcast for several months. The Administration provided a lengthy interview on the RLGC, but it was not included in the podcast. Councillor Esslinger was also interviewed.

Prior to beginning clean up, Administration, in partnership with Boyle Street Community Services Street Outreach, notified individuals living in the area that a large scale clean up effort was to occur. Ten of the 50 or so individuals were successfully housed by the Street Outreach team in transitional accommodations. From May 23 to May 29, 2019, 32 staff cleaned up 104 inactive encampments resulting in 30,000 kilograms of waste and over 3,700 needles. Park Rangers were on-site to prevent individuals from setting up encampments while clean up efforts were ongoing and will continue to patrol the area until September 7, 2019, in order to protect park remediation efforts. Park Rangers have also provided status updates to citizens who filed inquiries through 311. As part of park remediation, areas that have experienced significant degradation will be fenced off to allow for plants native to the Edmonton region to be replanted. This effort will continue into the 2020 season and involve watering and weed management as the vegetation is re-established. Homeless encampments continue to be an issue in all areas of the city and since the Dawson Park and Kinnaird Ravine clean up, there has been an increase in encampments in other areas. Specifically, homeless encampments have been established along the sidewalk on 106 Avenue between 100 Street and 101 Street. Street Outreach, with the support of Homeward Trust, are completing housing intakes with as many people as possible in the area before clean up efforts take place. As of July 3, 2019, there were 297 outstanding 311 inquiries related to encampments to be investigated by Park Rangers in areas outside Dawson Park. An average of 10 homeless encampment sites confirmed inactive are cleaned up daily. RS/GC/rp c: Executive Leadership Team Linda Sahli, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk",,"No",,,

In addition, starting in Q4 2018, ETS started surveying non-riders to better understand their perceptions of transit. In 2018, ETS maintained an overall customer satisfaction of 78% (consistent with 2017 results). Satisfaction rates for commuters, families, post-secondary students and special event riders ranged from 73-82%. Scores are highest for secondary students (89%) and lowest for riders with a disability (66%). Seniors, aged 65+, expressed the strongest appreciation (42% extremely satisfied). ETS Transit Operators received the highest scores for being skillful, safe and helpful (87-94%). The following attributes have the lowest satisfaction scores (between 63-69%): • Time-related factors (connections, bus frequency) • Comfort (overcrowding and enough bus shelters) • Convenience (Park & Ride facilities) • ETS communication Although the majority of riders continue to be satisfied with the convenience of fare purchase options (76% satisfied), the proportion is lower compared to 2017 and 2015. Perception for safety has also weakened, specifically related to waiting at LRT stations and transit centres (both from 79% in 2015 to 74% in 2018) and safety onboard LRT (86% in 2015 to 83% in 2018). Highly publicized security incidents in fall 2018 likely contributed to the decline in the perceptions of safety. The survey results also provided insight into customer demographics. Citizens aged 15-34 make up more than 50% of customers and have higher expectations of transit service, while seniors make up 10% and are highly satisfied with transit. ETS has work underway, based on customer feedback, to improve the customer experience and modernize public transit in Edmonton. The bus network redesign will be finalized in 2019 and rolled out in 2020, which will help allocate service to the routes experiencing overcrowding and delays. In addition, several new processes and measures are being (or have been) implemented to further enhance safety and security for passengers and staff. Further details about safety and security enhancements will be shared in Council report CR_6432 in fall 2019. ETS will also be phasing in the new Smart Fare Electronic Payment System in 2020 to provide customers with easy-to-use payment methods. Furthermore, ETS is undertaking customer journey mapping to understand the customer experience from a diverse range of customer personas, and to identify customer expectations, pain points and how best to meet their needs. This work will be completed by Q2 2020. A summary of the 2018 survey results is attached . This summary will be posted on takeETS.com and uploaded on the City of Edmonton’s Open Data portal. ETS will also present the results to the Edmonton Transit System Advisory Board (ETSAB) in late July.

Construction on the Civic Precinct Surface and Fountain Renewal Project began in mid-August of 2018. The opening was scheduled for late summer 2019, which was aggressive given the extent of work that needed to be done during the winter. During the demolition of the original fountain slab in the fall of 2018, unforeseen site conditions were encountered that began to delay the completion date. As the project continued, Administration worked closely with the contractor to minimize schedule impacts with the prime objective to open the fountain in the summer of 2019. Construction crews were often working double shifts. The concrete pour of the fountain base was completed on April 17, 2019. Since that time the completion schedule has been further impacted by the persistent wet weather which has impacted both ongoing concrete pours along the perimeter of the fountain and granite paver installation timelines. Recently it was discovered on site that the waterproof membrane for the fountain had experienced a failure and now must be removed and replaced. A new hoarding tent over the fountain has been installed that will facilitate the replacement of the waterproof membrane and the completion of the granite paver installation. Due to the requirement for the waterproof membrane replacement the new revised project schedule completion date is early October 2019, with every effort being made to achieve an earlier completion date if possible. We are fully aware of the importance of this project to City Council and the citizens of Edmonton and have made every effort to open this for service as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, we have encountered a number of complications on a project that had a very aggressive construction schedule. That being said, we want to ensure the remaining work is provided the time necessary to deliver a quality product that will provide durability and enjoyment for many years to come. Let’s hope for a glorious Fall so that Edmontonians can enjoy this lovely facility on warm weekends.

These questions (non-verbatim) were: ● Which service reviews had in-depth reviews? ● What has been the full attendance record at Challenge Panels? ● What degree of support or non-support for recommendations is there at Challenge Panels? Responses to these questions are below: Which service reviews had in depth reviews? To date, five (5) service reviews contained recommendations for business areas to initiate an in-depth review for further analysis. 1. Fire Investigation + Fire Prevention Inspection and Enforcement Service - Review of the Fire Bylaw to ensure that costs associated with investigation and inspection work are fully recovered through fees 2. Census - Conduct process review to determine if process re-engineering is required and improve overall efficiency of service 3. Park and Open Space Access + Roads ○ Detailed review to determine whether the City should continue to be in the business of owning and operating the existing Asphalt Plant ○ Detailed review to determine whether the City should continue to be in the business of owning and operating the existing Nursery 4. Recreation and Cultural Programming + Recreational and Sport Facility Access - In-depth review of Rundle Park Golf Course Operations. Explore options for repurposing Rundle Park Golf Course within a city wide golf course plan 5. Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis - Review to identify further synergies and refinements across GIS functions of the City to strengthen the hybrid service delivery model What has been the full attendance at Challenge Panels? The Challenge Panel is a core element of the Program and Service Review process that enables the City to solicit feedback from both leaders across the Corporation and individuals external to Administration. External Challenge Panel members are classified as either Standing or Revolving members. Standing Members typically represent post secondary institutes, private industry, or non profit operators. Standing Members volunteer to participate in a series of reviews and are selected as a result of their leadership in the community, private, or non-profit sectors. Revolving Members are peer experts that bring specialized knowledge of the service and are typically representing other comparable municipalities, similar private services, academia or non-profit operators. Revolving Members are typically subject matter experts for the service under review. As of July 3, 2019: ● 32 Challenge Panel sessions, including those from pilots, have been completed ● In total, 141 (of which 87 are distinct) external participants have contributed their time to Challenge Panels ● Administration estimates that over 560 total external Challenge Panel member hours have been volunteered ● On average there are four (4) external members present at each Challenge Panel session. The number of external members that are able to participate can vary dependent on time of year and type of service under review What degree of support or non-support for recommendations is there at Challenge Panels? The role of the Challenge Panel is to challenge draft recommendations and ensure that the supporting justification is comprehensive, thorough, objective, credible and reasonable. The peer experts will often act as a sounding board bringing forward their own experiences and providing advice on implementation. There are occasions where individuals have expressed non support or modification to the recommendations. However, these are usually individuals within the Challenge Panel as opposed to a consensus. Often, the expressions of non-support or modifications are based on lessons learned from other jurisdictions. These instances allow Administration to pause, reflect and reconsider recommendations as it may relate to our unique circumstances. For example, the Challenge Panel had near unanimous support on the Pet Licencing recommendation to “offer a one or two year pet licence”. The sole non-support came from a municipality that valued their annual interaction with pet owners because they also used the interaction to solicit donations to offset animal welfare and adoption services.. Although feedback was provided and noted, it did not ultimately impact the recommendation that was accepted by the majority of the Challenge Panel.",,"Yes","2019-07-02T00:00:00.000","6.2 - 6.3","City Council"

The amendments were presented and approved at the July 15 Public Hearing. Intergovernmental Updates Administration is working with the Mayor’s Office and the two sponsors for the Council Initiative on Housing to develop and articulate the case for investing in permanent supportive housing to key government stakeholders. A new governmental relations consultant has been retained to support the development of a clear and measurable advocacy strategy for engaging the Government of Alberta. An initial discussion between the Mayor and Councillors Walters and McKeen and the Minister of Seniors and Housing occurred during the last week of June and further political meetings are planned during the coming weeks. Information related to the permanent supportive housing advocacy was also included in the briefing package for Councillors attending the Calgary Stampede. At the federal level, relevant ministers and other representatives of the Government of Canada continue to express general support for Edmonton’s permanent supportive housing goals. Administration is engaging directly with the Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation to determine what they require from the City of Edmonton and a non-market housing provider for four prospective sites in order to best support a portfolio ask from the Co-Investment Fund for capital funding. These conversations are ongoing.

Information presented on Building Edmonton includes project updates related to scope, schedule and budget; as well as, contact information for the respective project manager for projects approved by City Council. See Attachment 1 for an overview of the performance of standalone capital projects. In general, compared to the Q4 2018 report, there has been a decrease in the overall number of active projects, with the majority of the projects reporting on budget and on schedule. The number of projects reporting “yellow” and “red” for schedule has decreased in Q1 and the number of projects reporting “yellow” and “red” for budget has increased slightly due to a variety of factors. Projects were impacted by factors such as direction to complete additional public engagement, delays in the finalization of the project scope, phasing of construction to allow business operations to continue, land acquisition, and site conditions. The Department is actively working to mitigate issues affecting the projects reporting as “yellow” or “red” to bring project performance back to the approved plan, where possible. For the Q2 2019 report, the IIS Department will be revising how projects are measured and reported on to better align reporting with the Project Development and Delivery Model (PDDM) process and industry practices .

This construction will be divided into two projects: ● Indoor Niche Building - Development of the second floor of the indoor niche building, elevator construction as well as upgrades to the existing washroom facility approved as part of the 2018 spring supplementary budget approval. ● Outdoor Niche and Pathway - Relocation of outdoor niches and pathway rehabilitation due to shifting ground conditions approved as part of the 2015 - 2018 budget cycle. This work is necessary to meet the current demand for indoor niche options, accessibility requirements and to eliminate a safety hazard on the stone pathway along the outdoor niche area. The cemetery will remain open during the construction and every effort will be made to minimize the impact it will have on visitors, the neighbourhood and the general public to ensure it continues to be a comfortable and safe place to visit. Families of loved ones who have been laid to rest at Mount Pleasant Cemetery and that will be impacted during construction will be contacted via mail during the week of August 5. We will also add information about the project on our cemetery web pages, display signage onsite and provide scripts for 311 agents. The indoor niche building expansion is expected to start in the fall of 2019 and be complete by the spring of 2020.

The downgrade was expected based on the negative outlook identified in previous years. In 2018 the outlook associated with Standard and Poor’s rating was negative and cautioned that the City of Edmonton could face a possible downgrade at some point in the next twelve months if the City’s capital plan put sustained pressure on its budgetary performance and increased its debt burden. The downgrade reflects the City of Edmonton’s large capital spending plan and associated growth in tax-supported debt. The number of significant capital projects being constructed within the 2019-2020 period (including the overlapping of the Valley Line Southeast and West projects) are expected to lead to larger after-capital deficits from 2019 to 2022, and the associated borrowing for these projects means that Edmonton’s tax-supported debt burden is more in line with ‘AA’ rated peers. Other cities experience similar situations in periods of high capital growth; for example, Ottawa saw a similar ratings downgrade in recent years. The rating includes a stable outlook with the expectation that the City’s funding strategy for capital projects will not further stress its budgetary performance. Weaker economic activity or unexpected major spending decisions at the same time the City is undertaking its capital plan could impact the rating negatively in the future. The rating could be positively impacted in the future if robust economic growth supported strong revenue generation. Following Standard & Poor’s announcement, we will issue a media release. Should the media be interested in an interview, we will focus on the following points: ● This downgrade is not a cause for concern; while this is a shift, the City’s credit rating remains strong. ● The downgrade is not expected to have an impact on the City’s cost of borrowing as the City currently borrows through the Alberta Capital Finance Authority using the debt rating of the Government of Alberta and combined borrowing volumes across Alberta. ● The City’s infrastructure spending occurs while interest rates are low, providing high value for taxpayers. ● Management of debt and liquidity is prudent. ● Through prudent decision making and smart investments, the City of Edmonton will continue to balance the City’s needs with resources and build smartly for the future.

Administration provided its latest update on this project to Executive Committee on April 5, 2019. In that report, we noted that ENMAX, as the future owner and operator of the Downtown District Energy system, applied to the AUC on November 8, 2018, for an exemption from AUC regulation. This exemption is an important consideration in the overall business case and financial viability of this project from ENMAX’s perspective. The August 1 ruling from the AUC denied the exemption request primarily because ENMAX did not demonstrate that sufficient competition will exist and therefore regulation from the AUC is necessary. ENMAX has informed Administration that their internal review of the AUC decision is ongoing. At this time no official response has been received by Administration. ENMAX has temporarily stopped work on the commercial agreements, which includes the Downtown District Energy Franchise Agreement. Work on the updated Design Base Memorandum, including updated technical and financial design information, will continue. In the upcoming weeks, ENMAX and Administration will continue to analyse the situation and will provide an update report including the consequences from the AUC decision to Executive Committee, currently scheduled for October 28, 2019.

Construction of the ADF was substantially completed in Summer 2018. Since then, the City has been working alongside the technology provider and contractor to go through the commissioning process, which is testing the technology and preparing for full operation of the ADF by processing organic feedstock from municipal solid waste and generating biogas. In April 2019, Waste Services launched the Edmonton Cart Rollout to 8000 homes, a demonstration project where households sort their organic material from their waste. The confluence of the organics pilot program and the need to test the ADF provided an opportunity to explore organics collection and processing, and test the new ADF with organics that needed to be processed. As our quality assurance testing of the ADF facility has progressed, some components have been identified to be repaired and enhanced to support the transition to full operations by Waste Services. This final stage of work will be completed this fall where the testing and commissioning will carry forward with an anticipated completion date in spring 2020. As this type of green facility is new for Edmonton, we continue to learn more about the complex technologies and systems involved in anaerobic digestion of waste. It is taking longer than expected for the ADF to reach full working capacity, but we are confident that our continued work with the contractors will ensure the facility meets standards for steady state operations and meets expectations of the City and its citizens. This work will not interrupt organics processing for the current Edmonton Cart Rollout. All organics collected from the 8,000 homes will temporarily be handled by a third-party organics processing provider. 2 For further information on the facility status, please contact Brian Latte at 780-496-3158.

The officers are responsible for the regulatory enforcement of cannabis-related businesses in Edmonton and cannabis-related odour offences on private property. Since fall 2018, Administration has received an increasing number of reports and complaints of businesses selling cannabis products without the required municipal and provincial licences. Officers identified several businesses operating in contravention of their licences at the beginning of 2019 and began investigations into those establishments. In March 2019, the Edmonton Police Service executed a search warrant on one of the businesses in March 2019, partly as a deterrent to the other businesses; however, it did not appear to have the desired effect as many businesses continued their unlawful operations. Administration issued $5,000 in fines and the Edmonton Police Service seized illegal cannabis products found within the business. While charges have been filed, no court dates have been set and the charges have not been proven. It may take up to 12 months for the courts to hear the case and make a decision. From August 3 to 10, 2019, Administration and Edmonton Police Service conducted a joint operation called Project Defuse which resulted in eight businesses attempting to sell cannabis to enforcement officers. Project Defuse led to Administration issuing $48,000 in fines for business licence and zoning offences. Administration has since been made aware of other businesses operating in Edmonton that may be selling cannabis products without a licence.

According to Homeward Trust, there were 345 unsheltered individuals (ie. sleeping outside or in other places unfit for human habitation) in Edmonton in July 2019. Despite available capacity in the shelter system, many of these people choose to remain unsheltered, citing concerns about safety, lack of storage, the shelter environment, and lack of accommodations for couples or pets. Approximately 63 percent of these unsheltered individuals self-identify as Indigenous and approximately 66 percent identify as male. The City of Edmonton does not fund or regulate emergency shelter services but works closely with the provincial government and Homeward Trust on issues related to homelessness and the provision of affordable housing. Homeward Trust is working to establish a local Shelter Systems Table that brings together shelter operators to align their operations, data, policies, and standards towards the goal of ending homelessness. This discussion will allow shelter operators to identify and discuss further opportunities for ensuring shelter services are low-barrier, trauma-informed, and housing-focused. During the spring election campaign, Alberta’s newly elected government committed to funding the redevelopment of Hope Mission’s Herb Jamieson emergency shelter. Administration and Homeward Trust are working closely with the Herb Jamieson Redevelopment Committee to integrate improved shelter design and operations into their proposed designs, which currently include 250 emergency shelter spaces. These efforts include engaging a consultant to generate an emergency shelter best practices report for consideration by Hope Mission. Additionally, in mid-August, Administration led a trip to Calgary to visit the Calgary Drop-In & Rehab Centre with stakeholders from the Hope Mission and Homeward Trust to observe the transformation that shelter has undertaken to modernize their operating standards and align them with housing-focused best practices. ../2 - 2 - The City of Edmonton is committed to helping support organizations that provide emergency shelter services in Edmonton to become low-barrier, trauma-informed, and housing-focused. Administration will continue to work with Homeward Trust and emergency shelter providers to provide opportunities to adopt best practices that reduce the number of unsheltered people.

Our goals are to ensure City facilities are neutral, non-partisan spaces for all and to safeguard Edmontonians’ trust in democratic processes. For your information, the following guidelines were provided to all City employees to ensure consistency across all City resources and City facilities. These guidelines may also be helpful to Council and their offices while responding to inquiries and requests during this period. Employee Code of Conduct The City of Edmonton’s Employee Code of Conduct outlines employee responsibilities with respect to personally engaging in any political activity or electioneering during normal working hours in the workplace. Political activities, such as canvassing, campaigning, and fundraising that aim to advance an individual’s or group’s political interests are not permitted in the workplace. Use of City Resources No City of Edmonton resources can be used by a candidate, member of a campaign team, political party or third party interest group for campaign purposes. This includes City resources (staff, officials, projects) being involved in the promotion of City projects, programs or services by any one candidate or party - ie. a project financed by the current government. If such an activity is necessary during the election campaign period, our Intergovernmental Affairs team in the External and Intergovernmental Relations Branch will provide guidance on how to do this in a non-partisan way. .../2 2 City Facilities No City of Edmonton facility may be used for public election-related activities by an individual candidate, group of candidates, political party or third party interest group. A City facility is a building or space owned and/or operated by the City of Edmonton. Examples of City facilities include (but are not limited to) City Hall, Edmonton Tower, recreation and transit centres, Orange Hub, maintenance yards, City-owned parking lots and entrances to such spaces. Campaign Materials and Signage No campaign materials may be worn, distributed or displayed in any City of Edmonton building or facility at any time. Campaign signs are not permitted on the grounds surrounding City facilities, nor on City parkland or roadways except pursuant to the Edmonton Parkland Bylaw and Edmonton Traffic Bylaw.

Administration has developed an expedited process to identify and review market sites that would be well-suited to permanent supportive housing developments. Site review criteria include location (distance to public transportation), development-readiness and potential, and the affordable housing ratio of the neighbourhood. These factors are assessed by multiple City business units. The effort to find appropriate sites more quickly has led Administration to pursue sites on the private real estate market to supplement the ongoing review of City-owned land. None of the sites identified to date are located in the city’s core neighbourhoods or along the northeast LRT corridor. Community Information Administration is preparing for community conversations on the first four City-owned sites later this year, once funding from the other orders of government has been secured. The team is working with a housing provider partner on the potential scope of the conversation, which will focus on how to successfully integrate the new developments with the neighbourhoods. Information materials will be developed to show that permanent supportive housing developments have already successfully integrated into other neighbourhoods. A consultant with a specialization in community facilitation is being retained to support these sessions. Administration is preparing an information package for City Council with further details on the sites, timelines, and whom in Administration to contact for further information. A strategy for expediting the public sessions is being developed in case the sites are announced by media or a partner before funding has been secured from the other orders of government. Intergovernmental Updates Members of City Council and Administration continue to advocate for funding support from the provincial and federal governments. Meetings and correspondence have been conducted over the summer with political and administrative counterparts at various levels. The City’s immediate goal is to get funding commitments from the Government of Alberta in the fall budget, which is expected to be critical for securing federal co-investment. Funding from both the provincial and federal governments will be essential to successfully delivering 600 units of permanent supportive housing in Edmonton. RS/am c.

The Earned Day Off (EDO) program is one of several options in our Compressed Hours of Work (CHOW) program. It requires employees to work additional unpaid time each day in order to accumulate paid time off as part of a regular work schedule. Employees typically work nine days with some unpaid time to have the 10th day off with pay. The EDO program is cost neutral given employees participating in the program work extra time each day to earn the day off. Participation in compressed work day arrangements is at the discretion of management and scheduling is managed by supervisors. One factor that management considers is whether the position, and type of work, lends itself to a compressed work week arrangement. Not all individuals who are eligible to participate in the EDO program have the opportunity to do so. CSU 52 Employee Two Week Shift Schedule Example Hours Worked Hours Paid Difference Monday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Tuesday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Wednesday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Thursday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Friday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Monday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Tuesday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Wednesday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Thursday 7.5 6.75 0.75 Friday 0 6.75 -6.75 At the City of Edmonton, approximately 37 percent of full-time permanent employees are eligible to participate in the program and they consist of CSU 52 and non-union staff. Only full-time employees are eligible to participate in a CHOW program. Another example of a CHOW program involves four ten-hour shifts (vs five) to achieve a forty hour work week. Using this example, this program provides double the earned days off (50+ days) than the CSU CHOW program (25 days off). From a productivity perspective, the number of hours worked under either program is the same. Flexibility in hours of work is now a common practice in many organizations as a means of increasing employee engagement. According to the Society for Human Resources Management’s article Leveraging Workplace Flexibility for Engagement and Productivity , “When workplace flexibility is implemented well, both employees and employers benefit, as productivity is maintained and employees are able to manage work and non-work demands more easily.” An example of this is employees using their earned day off to book medical and dental appointments, care for an aging parent, or do community or volunteer work. The cities of Calgary, Ottawa and Vancouver, the Government of Alberta, government organizations like the Workers’ Compensation Board, and diverse private sector employers have versions of an EDO program. Compressed Hours of Work Comparators EDOs per Year City of Edmonton: CSU 52 25 City of Edmonton: Management and Professional Technical 19 or 12 City of Calgary (Inside Workers) 25 Government of Alberta Varies EPCOR 10 paid personal leave days Research shows the increase in knowledge work (vs manual) has given rise to more opportunities for flexibility in the workplace. Alternative Work Strategies (AWS), including EDO programs, not only enable employees to have autonomy and flexibility over both personal and work demands resulting in being better equipped to manage both, but also serve as effective recruitment and retention strategies. According to Peter F. Drucker, “...knowledge worker productivity requires that knowledge workers are both seen and treated as an “asset” rather than a “cost.” It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.” Results from the IWG led Global Workspace Survey, a survey of 15,000 professionals from a range of industries in 80 countries, reported that 85% of Canadian employees responded that they would choose a job with flexible work arrangements versus one without. The survey also reported that “85% of employees confirm that productivity has increased in their company as a result of greater flexibility.” The EDO program is a part of the AWS work project underway in Employee Services which will focus on the City’s overall flexible work strategies and related policies, practices, and performance. At present, AWS has a dedicated role assigned to the initiative with work anticipated in Q4 including an assessment of the culture surrounding the availability of these days and their purpose.

The accelerated installation of retractable shields is part of the roughly $20-million in Council-approved funding from last fall for further safety and security enhancements on transit. In May 2019, Transit Fleet Maintenance installed retractable shields on four ETS buses to determine installation requirements on different bus models. Based on these requirements, the manufacturer has started producing customized shields for each model within the fleet. First Truck, an Edmonton-based heavy vehicle service provider, has been contracted to complete the installation. On October 7, First Truck will commence installation of the retractable shields, at a rate of approximately 30 shields per week, beginning with the 159 air conditioned ETS buses. After installation is complete on the air conditioned buses, retractable shields will be installed across the remainder of the fleet (roughly 1,000 buses in total). The anticipated completion date of retractable shield installation on the entire ETS bus fleet is fall 2020. Retractable shields give bus operators the ability to open or close a power window within the shield, depending on the circumstances. ETS will monitor shield use and provide Transit Operators with the necessary operational instructions.

As a result of this work, ten individuals were permanently housed. Extensive enforcement efforts from May to the beginning of September have kept the park clear of new encampments and allowed for parkland remediation in areas previously impacted. Over the summer months, many of the individuals who had been unsheltered and sleeping in Dawson Park and Kinnaird Ravine, as well as others new to Edmonton or the inner city, have set up new encampments north of downtown. These encampments are currently concentrated adjacent to Hope Mission, Bissell Centre and the LRT tracks along 95 Street. Given the complexity of health needs in this population and continued re-establishment of encampments in this area, a more robust, cross-systems response is needed including health and income supports. This approach will increase the likelihood of successful housing outcomes for unsheltered individuals in order to decrease the number of encampments overall. On September 25, Homeward Trust led an urgent meeting to establish an Encampment Response Team to support and house individuals who are occupying the encampments north of downtown. The team is made up of representatives from Homeward Trust, Bissell Centre, Boyle Street Community Services, Edmonton Police Service, Alberta Health Services, Alberta Supports, Government of Alberta, and the City of Edmonton. Multi-agency teams are currently identifying individuals by name to determine what kinds of support will be needed to transition them into housing. A sub-committee of the Encampment Response Team is meeting concurrently to generate a list of housing options. Throughout this effort, Edmonton Police Service and Administration are monitoring the areas to ensure safety. The team will meet again next week to review findings and determine next steps, including a recommended approach to enforcement. At the November 20, 2019, Community and Public Services Committee, Administration will provide an update on interim steps to fast track temporary transitional housing for unsheltered individuals and a corresponding plan to reduce homeless encampments across the city. Any questions or concerns regarding encampments, please feel free to reach out to myself or Christel Kjenner, Director, Housing and Homelessness at christel.kjenner@edmonton.ca .

All projects in the program are on track for completion as scheduled in 2019. City Council established TSAER in 2014 to specify the use of enforcement revenue for traffic safety programs. The program includes the design, engineering, construction, implementation, operation and maintenance of traffic control and signal upgrades. Rapid flashing beacons, overhead pedestrian crosswalk flashers, pedestrian traffic signals, signal visibility enhancements and protected left-turn phases are all examples of upgrades funded through the program. In June 2019, City Council approved the reallocation of some TSAER funds to increase investment in the measures listed above and catch up on work committed to in 2018. The delivery of the 2018 TSAER program had a late start, in part due to delays in equipment and limitations in how the City was able to procure contractor services. In 2019, a more flexible electrical services agreement has allowed for increased capacity to deliver on the traffic safety program. Most 2018 projects are completed and the rest will be done by the end of 2019. All confirmed TSAER-funded locations planned for 2019 have been initiated for construction. A few of the locations required revisions or replacement after functional design reviews. The 2019 program is 25 percent completed for crosswalk flashers and pedestrian signals. As of September, 80 percent of school crosswalk devices were operating, however they are considered 53 percent complete until all are connected to a permanent power source. Some are operating with solar power in the interim. The 2019 program is on track for completion by the end of the year. 2018 TSAER Projects Project Type Total Projects Under Construction Completed Completion Percentage Traffic Signal Upgrades 24 1 23 96% General Crosswalk Improvements 29 1 28 97% Intersection Signal Improvements 22 3 18 82% School Crosswalk Improvements 71 0 71 100% 2019 TSAER Projects Project Type Total Projects Under Construction Completed Completion Percentage Traffic Signal Upgrades 17 1 5 29% General Crosswalk Improvements 74 1 22 25% Intersection Signal Improvements 11 3 6 36% School Crosswalk Improvements 43 18 23 53% For questions or more information regarding this program, please contact Olga Messinis, Director of Traffic Operations with Parks and Roads Services, at olga.messinis@edmonton.ca.

An important aspect of this project is the removal of the traffic signals and direct access to Yellowhead Trail at 89 Street. Additional work included roadway improvements to better accommodate truck movements into and out of the Delton Business Area and the construction of new sidewalks to enhance pedestrian connectivity between the 97 Street and 82 Street interchanges. Although largely dependent on weather, the anticipated schedule to complete the removal of the traffic signals and access to Yellowhead Trail at 89 Street is as follows: ● October 7, 2019; removal of the left-turn movement from eastbound Yellowhead Trail to 89 Street. The intersection will remain open for all other traffic movements. ● October 13, 2019; the traffic signals will be removed from service and temporary traffic barriers will be installed to prohibit direct access to Yellowhead Trail at 89 Street. ● Yellowhead Trail will continue to be reduced to two lanes in each direction between 97 Street and 82 Street to facilitate the safe construction of the permanent traffic barriers between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Yellowhead Trail, and between Yellowhead Trail and 89 Street. It is anticipated that the lane reduction will be in place until the project is complete, which is currently scheduled for the end of October 2019. Area stakeholders and the public are being informed about the upcoming changes through a construction bulletin, email to subscribers, a public service announcement and social media messaging. Although a relatively small project within the freeway conversion program, the removal of the traffic signals and access to Yellowhead Trail at 89 Street serves as an important milestone. It is the first significant change on the corridor as part of the freeway conversion and it will have an immediate positive impact to users of Yellowhead Trail.

Councillor town hall-style sessions are distinct from the City’s public engagement work, but citizens don’t always understand the difference. We want to help you run such events more transparently, smoothly and easily using insight from experts in the area. The toolkit includes templates and checklists that will help you determine your needs and desired outcomes for each event, who should be invited from Administration and how you might structure your meeting. The toolkit also provides guidance on potential ways to follow up on key learnings, which can be shared with Council Services Communications and appropriate City departments at the Councillor’s discretion. Additionally, it will help provide a consistent experience for Edmontonians in their interactions with the City.

With colder weather on the way, Administration is working with community partners to accelerate an integrated response to the area and connect as many people as possible to housing and services. A response team, led by Homeward Trust, has been meeting weekly to coordinate efforts across health and housing systems in order to connect individuals living in the encampments with suitable housing options and wrap-around supports. On October 16, the Encampment Response Team began using an ETS bus as a mobile assessment space. Having assessments conducted on-site will reduce barriers to the intake process. Concurrent to outreach work, starting October 17, Administration will also begin selective clean-up of debris and garbage around the encampments near Hope Mission, Bissell Centre and the LRT tracks along 95 Street. Crews will be supported by City Peace Officers and Edmonton Police Service to ensure the safety of City staff, occupants of the encampments and the community. The Encampment Response Team has adopted a phased approach to clean-ups, starting with abandoned encampments followed by active sites, in order for ongoing housing work to continue for those living in the area while also addressing accumulated garbage and debris. Next week, clean-up efforts will focus on abandoned encampments, which are being identified proactively through outreach. Eviction dates and associated clean-ups for all encampments across the three locations will be set before the end of October. Outreach teams have been on-site since early September to identify and assess individuals in order to help move them into safe and sustainable housing solutions. Work to transition individuals from the encampments to housing will continue. To date, 66 individuals have been identified living in the area.

The question relates to proposed changes to local elections. At this time the City has not been notified about any pending reviews of Bill 23 - An Act to Renew Local Democracy in Alberta (see below for more information) and the legislation is not listed as an item for the fall session of the Alberta Legislature. On December 11, 2018 Bill 23 - An Act to Renew Local Democracy in Alberta came into effect, making changes to how municipal elections are conducted within Alberta. Bill 23 introduced changes on campaign contributions, third-party advertising, voter participation and transparency. Details of the changes introduced and the complete legislation can be viewed through this link . The legislation mirrors provincial election laws so that local and provincial elections can have consistent rules. One important change to the legislation deals with the campaign period, which is now January 1 to December 31 of the year of a general election. During this period, candidates may not accept campaign contributions or incur any campaign expenses until they have been nominated as a candidate. Another important change is the limitation on fundraising. Candidates may accept nominal contributions or incur expenses outside of the campaign period as long as the total amount of contributions or expenses does not exceed $2,000. Alberta Municipal Affairs has produced a series of documents explaining the changes to the Local Authorities Election Act . ● Campaign Finance and Contribution Disclosure Amendments ● Accountability and Transparency Amendments ● Voter Accessibility Amendments ● Third Party Advertising Amendments ● General Clarifying and Technical Amendments ● LAEA FAQs In addition, Bill 13: The Alberta Senate Election Act came into force on July 18, 2019. This legislation brings back Senate nominee elections so voters can decide who will best represent them in the Senate. Key changes include allowing voters to elect a Senate nominee as part of provincial or municipal elections, as a standalone process or with a referendum. City Administration is monitoring any developments on this legislation and will provide updates should any engagement opportunities arise. Please contact the Elections and Census Office at 780-496-8008 with any questions.

In 2020, the focus was on constructing the westbound lanes of Yellowhead Trail and three dry ponds. In 2021, the remaining work will be completed, including the construction of eastbound Yellowhead Trail and improvements at 50 Street and Victoria Trail interchanges. Additional information on each project is provided in Attachment 1.

Due to the level of uncertainty, the emphasis was placed on communications materials with clear messaging to instill confidence in the overall program and projects. Recognizing the importance of public input, the program team developed several online engagement strategies, with many of them being implemented as part of the online events launched in early fall 2020. Our online engagement sessions were successful as we effectively illustrated the potential network changes of the various projects and enabled the general public to ask questions and provide input to help our team make better-informed decisions. Program engagement activities included online learning sessions, surveys, Engaged Edmonton, and additional content is on the project websites, such as narrated presentations and informative videos. Public support for the freeway conversion continues to be strong. A newsletter updating the public of the Program’s progress has been distributed by email to subscribers and made available through the City’s website. A copy of the newsletter is provided in Attachment 3. Land Acquisition The project considers opportunities to mitigate land requirements and minimize impacts to the adjacent business and residential communities. Land acquisition is being staged and prioritized to align with the planned sequencing of construction. To date, 98 property interests have been initiated, of which 49 interests have been acquired. For the remaining 49 interests, negotiations are underway on 41, with eight on hold pending additional planning considerations. As planning progresses for the segment of Yellowhead Trail from St. Albert Trail to 97 Street project, additional land acquisition requirements will be identified. Budget/Financial The total approved budgets for the projects outlined in this report are funded for the scope defined within capital profiles, Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion: Project Development (CM-99-0060) and Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion: Project Delivery (CM-99-9600). The Program is within budget and on target to meet schedule commitments. In September 2020, the funding agreement with the Government of Albert","of Alberta was finalized. Provincial contribution begins in 2023 and extends to the end of 2027. The timeline aligns closely with the Government of Canada agreement, which started in December 2018 and extends to March 2028. 3 If you have any questions or require clarification relating to any of the information provided, please contact Kris Lima, Director - Yellowhead Trail Portfolio, at Kris.Lima@edmonton.ca or 780-496-8381.

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. The Major General Griesbach School built in 1950 is a good example of the Early Modern Style of architecture and is typified by the use of clean horizontal lines, flat roofs, and horizontal bands of windows and modest horizontal articulation of the brick coursing. The school is also significant for its association with the development of Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Griesbach in Edmonton. The school was constructed to serve the children of the families living on the base. The base and remaining buildings have since been transferred to Canada Lands Company and continues to be redeveloped as the now residential neighbourhood of Griesbach. The school is also known for its association with Major General William Antrobus Griesbach, a prominent Edmontonian who was a veteran, lawyer and politician. Griesbach had a law firm in Edmonton and became the youngest Mayor in 1907 at the age of 29. He later served as Member of Parliament and in 1921 was named to the Senate and commissioned as a Major General for his service to the armed forces. The property owner has satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality the ability to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner's consent. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week.  c: Executive Leadership Team Kim Petrin, Branch Manager, Development Services Denis Beaudry, Acting City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

The vendors are expected to be notified shortly, which may spur complaints or comments to media or councillors. City of Edmonton Position: The City issued a Safety Codes Order effective October 29, and it will remain in place until safety issues on site are addressed. Key Messages: ● While we know how much Edmontonians appreciate farmers markets, it is our responsibility to ensure they are safe. ● We are working with the farmers market operator and the building owner as they rectify the shortcomings identified in a recent inspection. ○ There are challenges with the sprinkler system, fire separations, and the ventilation system. Further design and construction is required to satisfy minimum life safety requirements. ○ In a 100-year-old building, it can be difficult for old and new systems to come together smoothly. ● When they have completed the work needed to meet the safety codes requirements, we’ll re-inspect promptly and carefully. If we are satisfied that all safety concerns have been rectified and there is no risk to public safety, the farmers market can open. Approach : As standard practice, Administration serves Safety Codes Orders to owners and/or those in care or control of the property but does not proactively release these to the media or post online. If there are media inquiries, a spokesperson would be made available to confirm the contents of the order or details about safety code requirements. Any comments about timelines for improvements would need to be addressed by the building owner. Business impacts of the closure would need to be addressed by either the Market Board or affected vendors. Background: The 104 St. operating licence of the Edmonton Downtown Farmers Market (EDFM) was cancelled in December 2018 due to projected utility work in advance of LRT construction anticipated for summer 2019. A change in construction/utility planning later allowed the market to return to 104 St. during the summer with the intention to move into the former GWG building (10305 - 97 Street ) following the Thanksgiving holiday. (See Issues Briefing #2019-17) In May 2019, City Administration advised the owner of permits needed to open for the fall target date. On October 10 City administration conducted a routine site check and it was learned that the owner of the building did not have the required City permits for the market to open to the public. It was anticipated the issue could be resolved between the owner and the City in a timely manner. A safety codes and provincial fire code inspection subsequently noted issues with the fire sprinklers. The building owner was notified that the building could not be opened to the public until the fire code issues were addressed and passed inspection. (See Issues Briefing #2019-32) On October 26 the EDFM opened without having passed safety inspections for fire sprinklers, fire walls and ventilation under provincial codes. Passing these provincial safety requirements is mandatory in order to o btain a City of Edmonton business license and to ensure the safety of the public. The GWG Building is more than 100 years old. It is listed on Edmonton’s Inventory of Historic Resources. Built in 1911, this commercial building was converted into a factory by Great Western Garments (GWG) in 1914. This site was renovated and expanded in 1968 and the building was sold in 2003. It is not known when the existing sprinkler system was installed. The City of Edmonton is leasing the GWG Building and has a sublease with the Edmonton Downtown Farmers Market for $1, funded through the Community Revitalization Levy.

This week, the Alberta government introduced two omnibus bills that legislate some of the changes announced in Budget 2019. Key among them is the repeal of the City Charters Fiscal Framework Act, a significant impact on the City. Other legislative changes include impacts to labour relations in the public sector, fines collected by municipalities, cost of living increases for AISH and seniors benefits recipients, removal of the cap on regulated electricity rates. Highlights of Legislative and Budgetary Changes Bill 20: Fiscal Measures and Taxation Act, 2019 ● Repeals the City Charters Fiscal Framework Act (formerly Bill 32, approved by all parties in the Legislative Assembly, December 2018 ) ● Creates the Local Government Fiscal Framework Act ○ The existing MSI agreements remain in effect, but any part of an agreement that is inconsistent with this new Act is void. ○ For 2019-2022, amount of funding for each municipality is determined by the Minister, total amount available province wide is $2.5B ○ After 2022, Edmonton and Calgary will have a separate funding formula where the cities share $455M (down from $500M agreed to in the City Charters Fiscal Framework) ○ The MSI component in the new fiscal framework is limited to 50% of the growth of provincial revenues. The previous fiscal framework limited growth to 50% in year 1 but the amount escalated each year after that (grows at 55% of revenue in year 2, 60% in year 3 etc. until reaching a 100% in year 10). The new formula permanently limits the growth in grants to 50% of the growth in provincial revenues. ○ Under the City Charters Fiscal Framework Act, the $500 million in funding was split between a revenue component which was allocated between the two cities on the basis of the existing MSI formula, and a fuel component allocated to each city on a set percentage. The change in allocation methodology will reduce Edmonton’s proportional share compared to Calgary (details to be shared on November 5, 2019) ● Creates the new Public Transit and Green Infrastructure Act ○ Honours the existing agreement with Calgary dated January 30, 2019. ○ Contemplates a future agreement with Edmonton for construction of an LRT project. ○ Commits $1.47 billion to Edmonton by the end of 2027-28 for the purpose of LRT construction. ○ Notwithstanding a future agreement, Cabinet can, by regulation change the funding to be provided to Edmonton, and the Minister, by regulation, can amend any term of the agreement. The funding agreement can be terminated without cause on 90 days notice by order of Cabinet. ● Ends the indexing of the personal income tax brackets and other tax rates. ● Repeals the Investing in a Diversified Alberta Economy Act. ● Ends the tax credits for scientific research and experimental development. ● Repeals the Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit Act and removes related tax credits. Bill 21: Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability Act, 2019 ● Creates the Public Sector Employees Act ○ Allows the Minister to issue directives to school boards, regional health authorities, post secondaries, and public agencies (e.g. WCB, AGLCC, etc.) regarding what the employer may propose or accept in collective bargaining. ○ Directives issued are confidential and may not be disclosed. ● Amends the Public Service Act to set the amount of severance pay that may be provided and require repayment if an employee is rehired. ● Amends the Labour Relations Code re-introducing the ability to use replacement workers during a strike or lockout for essential services. ● Adds a new regulation-making power to the Employment Standards Code allowing classes of employees to be exempted from the Code. ● Employees subject to collective agreements cannot make complaints under the Code. ● With regard to regional health authorities, allows Cabinet, by regulation, to terminate agreements between the Crown and Alberta Medical Association with respect to compensation. ● Amends the Provincial Offences Procedure Act to expand the purposes for which fine amounts that do not belong to the province can be retained. *Note: the budget includes the detail that current fine retention amounts set by regulation will change, with municipalities receiving 60% (down from 73.3%). ● Amends a number of Acts to allow Cabinet to determine when Consumer Price Index (CPI) will apply to benefit rates - seniors benefits, seniors lodge rates, A","s, AISH. ● Repeals the Act to Cap Regulated Electricity Rates and ends the cap effective November 30, 2019. ● Sets new requirement for annual infrastructure reports containing updates on capital plans and projects. ● Provincial budgets must include assessment of the impact of the fiscal plan on debt. Next Steps Bills 20 and 21 are currently at the Second Reading stage. It is expected they will be approved soon. The budget itself will also be approved in this legislative session. More details on the direct impacts of the provincial budget and related legislation on the City’s operating and capital budgets will be shared with Council at the November 5, 2019 Council meeting. At that time the Supplementary Operating Budget Adjustment (SOBA) and Supplementary Capital Budget Adjustment (SCBA) reports will be presented along with more detailed information on the financial impacts of the Alberta budget and related legislation (as per Council discussion and motions on October 25, 2019). Administration will continue to keep Council informed of any related legislative updates.

Since the September update, the Response Team has identified a potential fifth site from the private real estate market that is suitable for use as permanent supportive housing. Administration has initiated negotiations with the site owner and will provide additional updates as negotiations progress. Advocacy and Intergovernmental Updates On September 9, 2019, Alberta Health Services expressed support for the City of Edmonton’s and Homeward Trust’s joint funding application to the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation. In its letter to the federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Alberta Health Services committed to providing supportive health services in association with the City’s permanent supportive housing work. This commitment will include Alberta Health Services community staffing, supplies and resources for home care, addictions and mental health supports valued at more than $10 million. Alberta Health Services also highlighted that investing in permanent supportive housing and other related interventions will lead to a higher quality of life and less social disorder in the community while reducing the financial impacts of chronic homelessness to all orders of government. On September 30 and October 1, 2019, members of Administration met with officials in Ottawa to talk to them about Edmonton’s permanent supportive housing plans. The meetings were with representatives from Employment and Social Development Canada, Finance Canada, Health Canada, Infrastructure Canada, Indigenous Services Canada, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. During these meetings, City staff shared the City’s whitepaper: A Plan for Permanent Supportive Housing and highlighted the urgent need for permanent supportive housing in Edmonton and discussed how the City can work with the federal civil service to support the delivery of permanent supportive housing. The meetings were designed to inform key decision-makers of the City’s work so they can include Edmonton’s plan in briefing documents for the new ministers. Once new ministers are announced, Administration will seek further meetings to continue the conversation. The City's fall 2019 budget submission to the Government of Alberta outlined Edmonton’s high-level funding requests based on priorities identified during the City’s budget deliberations and other Council discussions. Based on these discussions, the City identified permanent supportive housing as one of two funding requests. Budget 2019 did not include any funding commitments for permanent supportive housing. Administration will continue advocacy efforts to align with the Government of Alberta’s identified priorities in order to ensure permanent supportive housing is included in the next budget cycle, anticipated in spring 2020. Public Relations The City of Edmonton and Homeward Trust are preparing a memorandum of understanding to clarify roles and responsibilities associated with the first four permanent supportive housing sites. The memorandum will guide the planning and redevelopment phases for these sites and will define responsibilities for public engagement. The Permanent Supportive Housing Response Team is developing a communications plan in conjunction with the engagement plans. A communications and engagement consultant has been retained to assist with the development and execution of these plans, which will identify key project milestones and touchpoints with key stakeholders and the public.

Administration hired Alstom Transport Canada Inc. to install an alternative to the Thales Canada Inc. system in April 2019. Alstom is installing a fixed-block signalling system, which is the same type of fixed-block signalling system that is installed on the Capital Line; this type of system prevents more than one train from entering the same block of space, which is outlined by sensors in the tracks. Since April, Alstom has secured much of the necessary hardware, some of which requires several months to produce and deliver, and is progressing through the detailed design for the project. Alstom will be installing new hardware on the tracks between MacEwan and NAIT stations to track train movements, and new software to manage train movements. Hardware installation is expected to begin in early November and software will be installed largely in parallel with it. The most visible work will be the installation of the hardware on the tracks, which will involve cutting concrete to make room for the hardware, installing the sensors and supporting equipment like electrical conduits and drainage, and then covering it up with concrete again. We anticipate the work will require some single-tracking which could result in minor schedule changes. We are working to limit these impacts as much as we can, and to share news of any disruptions in advance. Installation will take approximately one year, followed by testing and commissioning. In the meantime, the Metro Line will continue to safely operate using the Thales signalling system and the speed and other restrictions that have been in place since the line opened in 2015. City Operations will manage the decommissioning of the Thales system at a later date. We will be sharing a public update on the project through the Transforming Edmonton blog, social media, our website, and emails to key stakeholders and our project distribution list.

Fair Deal Panel Mandate and Membership As outlined by the Premier, the 9-member Panel, which will be led by Hon. Preston Manning is asked to examine a number of initiatives to see whether they would advance the province's interests. These include the process for municipal-federal agreements, taking control of revenue collection, creating an Alberta pension plan, establishing a provincial police force and a formalized provincial constitution. Of interest to municipalities, the Panel is also asked to consider the potential of emulating Quebec’s legal requirement that public bodies, including municipalities and school boards, obtain the approval of the provincial government before they can enter into agreements with the federal government. The full details of the mandate and membership can be found in the Premier’s mandate letter .

The Program is being implemented through a combination of large and small projects in support of upgrading Yellowhead Trail to a freeway . Program Update - Overview ● Concept planning of the Yellowhead Trail and 66 Street area project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019. The final concept plan for an overpass over Yellowhead Trail with limited access at 66 Street was shared with the public at engagement events held on October 23 and 26, 2019. ● Concept planning of Yellowhead Trail from St. Albert Trail to 97 Street, which includes the accesses at 127 Street and 121 Street, is underway and scheduled to be completed by the spring of 2021. Initial public engagement events, including meetings with project area residents, stakeholders, business owners, and property owners are scheduled throughout November 2019. ● Preliminary design of the 156 Street to St. Albert Trail (Mainline) and the Fort Road Widening (Yellowhead Trail to 66 Street) projects will begin late in 2019 . Public engagement events will begin early in 2020. ● Detailed design is ongoing in anticipation of 2020 construction for the following projects: ○ 123 Avenue (156 Street to 142 Street) ○ Yellowhead Trail East Widening (west of 50 Street to the North Saskatchewan River) 2019 Construction Progress ● Construction of the 124 Avenue (149 Street to 142 Street) roadway improvement project began in June 2019 and was substantially completed in September 2019. Streetlight installation will be completed in 2020. ● Construction of 128 Avenue (156 Street to St. Albert Trail) roadway improvement project began in May 2019 and is nearly complete. The remaining work to be completed in 2020 includes road renewal of 149 Street north and south of 128 Avenue, landscaping and streetlight installation. ● Construction of 125A Avenue (97 Street to 82 Street) roadway improvement project began in May 2019 and is tentatively scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of November 2019. Removal of the signalized intersection at Yellowhead Trail and 89 Street was completed on October 13, 2019. Landscaping will be completed in 2020. Additional information regarding each of the projects is included in Attachment 1. Project planning and design are scheduled to be completed by 2023 with construction anticipated to continue through to the end of 2026. A summary of the overall Program schedule is provided as Attachment 2. Public Engagement and Communications Engagement has focused on building public awareness of the program and creating opportunities for the public to provide input that help the project team make balanced and well-informed decisions. A newsletter updating the public of the Program’s progress will be distributed by email to subscribers and made available through the City’s website and social media. A copy of the newsletter is provided in Attachment 3. Land Acquisition To date, 86 property interests have been initiated of which 43 interests have been acquired. For the remaining 43 interests, negotiations are underway on 41 with 2 on hold pending additional planning considerations. The majority of these properties are located near 149 Street and Fort Road where concept planning is complete. As planning progresses for the Yellowhead Trail and 66 Street Area project and the St. Albert Trail to 97 Street project additional land acquisition requirements will be identified. Budget/Financial Included in the 2019 Spring Supplementary Capital Budget Adjustment, Administration received approval to update the currently approved capital profiles (scope, schedule, and budget) to align more closely with the Project Development and Delivery Model (PDDM). This will improve the reliability, accuracy, and transparency in estimates of budget and schedule for projects. It should be noted that the original concept plan for the 66 Street area, as approved in the Capital Profile 15-66-2224 Yellowhead Trail - 89 Street and 66 Street Improvements, was based on the limited scope of removing the 66 Street signalized intersection.

It is anticipated that the cost to develop and deliver an overpass over Yellowhead Trail with limited access at 66 Street could exceed the original budget included in Capital Profile 15-66-2224.

The updated Bylaw now categorizes residential properties based on the type of service they receive (curbside/alley or bin collection). These changes mean that all residents who receive Residential Curbside Collection will now be charged the same rate for the service. As of January 1, 2020, the monthly utility rate for Waste Services will gradually increase for 9,000 residents who currently receive Residential Curbside Collection but pay a reduced rate for multi-unit bin collection. These residents will receive a letter in the mail in November and a notice on their EPCOR utility bill in January notifying them of the upcoming changes. For the next five years, residents can expect their monthly utility rate to increase by about $3.30 each year in addition to the approved annual increase to the Waste Services utility rate. This gradual increase will help residents adjust to the new rate over time and prevent rate shock. The remaining 18,000 multi-unit residents affected by the Bylaw change will be evaluated in 2020. If the evaluation determines a rate change is required, new rates would take effect in 2021 and be implemented with the same phased approach. Administration will present an amendment to the Waste Services Bylaw (18590) at the December 11, 2019 City Council budget meeting. This amendment is subject to discussion and approval of the Waste Services Supplementary Operating and Capital budget adjustments at the December 6, 2019 Utility Committee meeting.

Highlights of the Bills Bill 22: Reform of Agencies, Boards and Commissions and Government Enterprise Act Bill 22 proposes changes to eliminate unnecessary government spending and improve the efficiency and oversight of public agencies. Bill 22 is a follow-up to the Blue Ribbon Panel’s recommendation that the government should conduct a comprehensive review of all departments, agencies, boards and commissions, as well as the wider public sector, to provide a more effective and efficient service delivery to Albertans. An overview of the changes introduced in Bill 22 is provided below: Alberta Capital Finance Authority ● All directors of ACFA are terminated ● Shares allotted to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Alberta are cancelled ● Shares allotted to municipalities (and other entities) are cancelled in exchange for $10 ● In lieu of the board, Cabinet will appoint a single director to oversee ACFA ● Comes into force on Royal Assent (note new Act comes into force on proclamation) Local Authorities Capital Financing Act (new) ● Minister may loan money to local authorities for the purpose of financing or refinancing new or existing capital projects or assets, public works, buildings, or structures ● Minister has the authority to determine if a project fits within the definition above ● Enables a new regulation establishing a limit on the total principal amount of all outstanding loans to all local authorities. Once this limit is reached, no new loans may be issued ● All existing statutory requirements related to borrowing (e.g. advertising) remain in place ● ACFA will eventually be dissolved once transition has been completed ● Act comes into force on proclamation Alberta Competitiveness Act ● Repealed ● Act allowed for creation of an agency to increase competitiveness and support innovation Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCO) ● Expands the list of entities AIMCO can support, likely to correspond with other changes announced through budget re: consolidating WCB and teachers’ pensions Alberta Sport Connection ● Dissolved, and Act is repealed ATB Financial ● Adds new business objectives for ATB, including managing its business in a commercial and cost-effective manner Election Act ● Current, independent Election Commissioner position is removed, and all references deleted ● Authorities of the Election Commissioner will fall under the Chief Electoral Officer ● Adds new provisions dealing with successor political parties ● Corresponding amendments made to Local Authorities Election Act Employment Pension Plans Act ● Wording added in to cover off excess contributions of members of jointly sponsored pensions made by members on or after January 1, 1992 Historic Resources ● Alberta Historical Resources Foundation is dissolved ● Historic Resources Fund is disestablished, transferred to general revenue fund ● No impact on City’s ability to designate municipal historic resources Joint Governance of Public Sector Pension Plans ● Adding a member to the Sponsor Board to represent non-union employees ● Candidates must be a non-union employee or a person who has a connection to non-union employees ● Corporation must engage Alberta Pension Services Corporation as the exclusive administrative service provider, and AIMCO as the exclusive investment manager ● Cabinet will appoint members of the board of directors. There must be the same number of the board of directors as are appointed to the Sponsor Board ● There will be a rotation of member appointments where an employer organization has the authority to appoint a member of the Sponsor Board, the other employer organization has the authority to nominate an individual to the board of directors ● AUPE will continue to be permitted to appoint a member to the Board directly ● Comes into force on Royal Assent Post-Secondaries ● Campus Alberta Strategic Directions Committee is dissolved Bill 25: Red Tape Reduction Implementation Act Bill 25 proposes changes to 11 pieces of legislation to streamline overburdened processes and eliminate outdated rules. If approved, these changes are intended to create ad","d to create administrative efficiencies for a variety of stakeholders. An overview of the changes introduced in Bill 25 is provided below: Alberta Health Care ● Removes chiropractic services as a basic health service ● Health Professions Advisory Board dissolved Joint Use and Planning Agreements ● Moves these provisions from the Charter Regulations to the MGA, making them applicable across Alberta ● Corresponding amendments to the Education Act ● Comes into force on Proclamation Municipal Government Act ● Power to define “meeting” by regulation is removed. Corresponding regulation will be repealed as well. This was a City of Edmonton red tape reduction suggestion. ● Adds a new provision regarding the creation of City Charters to remove the requirement for 60 days posting on the provincial website if: ○ the amendments correspond to feedback received during a previous 60-day consultation period. For example, if a provision was posted exempting a City from paying compensation when designating historic resources, and this was objected to by property owners, a future amendment to remove such a provision would not be required to be posted for 60 days because it reflects a response received ○ an Act affected by the Charter is amended to make the Charter inapplicable, the Charter can be amended to reflect this without posting. For example, the changes made to the MGA to move certain A&T provisions from the Charter to the MGA can be deleted from the Charter without the 60-day consultation period ○ Charter can be amended to correct errors that do no affect the substance without a 60-day posting period ○ This change is retroactive to April 2018 when Charters were first contemplated in the MGA ● No changes are made to the process for passing a Charter Bylaw ● Increases the time period to hold a municipal byelection from 90 days to 120 days ● Removes the regulation making authority to allow additional reasons for closing Council meetings. No Regulation was ever passed so no changes are required. ● Removes the requirement to record the names of all persons present during private Council meetings. ○ Note: Edmonton’s Council Procedures Bylaw duplicates this requirement, so the requirement will continue for Edmonton until the bylaw is amended ● Moves a number of provisions related to A&T from the Charter Regulation to the MGA, making them applicable to all municipalities. No change for Edmonton. ● Revises the requirements for IDPs to allow two municipalities that would otherwise be required to have a plan to agree that one is not required. If either party revokes that agreement, municipalities have one year to create a plan ● Moves the requirement for joint use and planning agreements from the Charter Regulation to the MGA, making it applicable to all municipalities. Agreements must be in place within 3 years - unclear whether the 3-year period started for Edmonton when this was added to the Charter (June 2019) or will start when this amendment comes into force on proclamation ● Amends the language related to ICFs to fully exempt municipalities that are members of a growth management board from the requirement to develop ICFs, whether or not the same topics are covered in the growth management board’s growth or servicing plans. ICFs are still permitted in this situation, but no longer mandatory. ● If doing an ICF, section 708.29 is amended to create flexibility for what is included. There are no longer prescribed lists or prescribed services. Without the specified list of services (topics), this could be why ICFs can no longer be mandatory (see 708.29). ● Previous amendments to the MGA that were not proclaimed related to JUPAs are repealed on proclamation of this Act. ● Unless otherwise noted above, all of these changes come into effect on January 1, 2020 Persons with Developmental Disabilities Foundation ● Foundation is dissolved and Act repealed Safety Codes ● Provision allowing wood frame construction up to 6 storeys is removed ● Note: the purpose of the provision was to permit wood construction up to 6 storeys as long as the construction complied with the Act, including the Codes.

Deputy City Manager","Joining Provincial Automated System for Oversize Vehicle Permits",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KacsG3La-DwR1C3dTOW00fpmtKqWXIJh)","The City of Edmonton plans to update the permitting system for overweight and over-dimensional vehicles by joining the Transportation Routing and Vehicle Information System Multi Jurisdiction (TRAVIS) in 2020. The TRAVIS system is a provincially developed and managed automated system for provincial and municipal roads. The move to TRAVIS will improve permit efficiency for both industry and City Administration. Background A provincial permit is required when an overweight and/or over-dimensional vehicle travels on a roadway in Alberta. The provincial permit is issued through the TRAVIS system. A municipal permit is also required when the vehicle uses municipal roads. Currently, the City maintains its own, separate permitting system for vehicle movements within municipal boundaries. As many commercial carriers use both provincial and municipal roads, Alberta Transportation developed TRAVIS in 2011 so provincial and municipal permits could be applied for in one place. Many municipalities have joined since the program began, including Calgary (2015) and Red Deer (2014). Edmonton’s Sign-on to TRAVIS The City of Edmonton has worked with the provincial government for the past few years to test and incorporate the City’s data into TRAVIS. Administration is confident in the system’s design and operation and sees benefit in joining. The system automatically checks load compliance with municipal roadway construction standards and agreements, then issues the permit if appropriate. Other benefits include ease of use and higher compliance from industry. The transition to TRAVIS requires adopting a permitting fee structure based upon a per kilometre rate set out in the Alberta Traffic Safety Act - Commercial Vehicle Dimension and Weight Regulation . In addition to the TRAVIS permitting fee, the City will continue to set a baseline single trip fee amount for a single trip permit and trips that require City of Edmonton coordination and support. .../2 -2- Through joining the TRAVIS system, Administration plans to modernize the fee structure as no updates have been made since 2008. A baseline single trip permit fee will increase from $20 to $25, and a coordination fee of $140 will be introduced for more complex trips that require coordination with utilities. These fees match Calgary’s current rates.The majority of applicants will see an overall decrease in total fees paid compared to today. Next Steps To date, industry has not been engaged therefore in anticipation of joining TRAVIS, Administration is preparing a communication plan and targeted industry engagement to share the system’s processes and rationale in early 2020. The feedback will inform the TRAVIS implementation in Edmonton. Administration is planning to bring amendments to Traffic Bylaw 5590 to Council in spring 2020 to allow the permit transition. Subject to City Council’s approval of the amendment, the City will finalize an agreement with the Province to officially join TRAVIS in spring 2020.

Councillors have requested key messages in the event they receive inquiries from media or the public prior to the December 11, 2019 Special Council meeting. City of Edmonton Position: Administration engaged a third party consultant to respond to the direction given by Council in its August 27, 2019, and September 10, 2019 motions. Council has heard a presentation on the consultant’s recommendations during the Special Council meeting on December 9, 2019. Council has deferred discussion of the recommendations until December 11, 2019 at 1:30 p.m. The consultant’s report will be released publicly on December 10, 2019 at noon. Until Council has made a decision about the report recommendations and next steps, Administration has no further comment. Key Messages: ● The Ernst & Young report addresses two Council motions and provides future state recommendations for improved role clarity between Edmonton Global and EEDC and addresses opportunities to improve the efficiency and governance of City-funded innovation entities identified in the YEG Innovation Compass Report. ● Council will continue its discussion of the recommendations as well as next steps in a private Special Council meeting on December 11, 2019 at 1:30 p.m. ● The report was released publicly on December 10, 2019 at noon. ● Administration is unable to comment until it receives further direction from Council. Communications Approach : The public release of the consultant’s report may generate interest and questions from employees, businesses, media, and members of the public. Council has yet to complete its consideration of the report recommendations and has made no decisions regarding next steps. Consequently, City staff will refrain from responding to inquiries until after Council has provided further direction. EEDC and Edmonton Global have received copies of the consultant’s report and presentation and may choose to comment on it publicly. Administration will not comment on this issue until Council’s direction has been provided. Background: Two Council motions (September 10, 2019 and August 27, 2019) provided Administration with direction related to the operating efficiency, role clarity and governance of EEDC and Edmonton Global and EEDC and City-funded technology innovation entities TEC Edmonton, Start-up Edmonton, Health City, and Edmonton Screen Industries. Administration retained Ernst & Young (E&Y) through a limited RFQ to complete a limited scope review, including interviews and focus groups with selected stakeholders. The consultant’s response to the Council motions identifies confusion among stakeholders regarding the roles and responsibilities of EEDC and Edmonton Global on activities related to Foreign Direct Investment and Trade as well as Business Retention and Expansion. Similarly, the consultant identified confusion between tech-innovation entities and innovation entrepreneurs seeking business support. Options to improve role clarity and strengthen governance are contained within the consultant’s report which will be made public on December 10. 2019 at noon.

This offering is part of a larger approach to more effectively prioritize, structure and target discounts in a way that increases market share and/or revenue generation. The Black Friday sale was specifically structured to increase revenue by attracting new members to City recreation centres and encouraging existing single admission visitors to become members. This is the most significant and successful product promotion Administration has implemented. Total sales included 2,932 annual memberships, 467 continuous monthly memberships, 590 monthly passes, and 4,545 multi-admissions. This resulted in gross revenue of $1.33 million over four days, with implementation costs of $14,000 plus $5,000 in additional customer service staff. The sale was targeted to people who did not already have a membership, which has resulted in questions from current members about how the City honours their patronage. Offering current members relevant perks and benefits is a crucial aspect of retention planning. Currently, members receive a number of benefits, including discounts on programs, early registration for programs, members-only events, free childminding where available and more .

The analysis is underway and the report will be presented to the Committee in March 2020. RS/sh c: Executive Leadership Team Denis Beaudry, Acting City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk",,"No",,,

Administration committed to providing an update on the review of the program to City Council once complete. The Summer Playground Program offers quality, free, safe programs in local neighbourhoods. Currently, the Summer Playground Program includes three levels of programming at neighbourhood or district park sites - Extended Hour, Standard Hour, and Pop-Up Play. The Extended Hour program level offers a full day of activities every weekday. The Standard Hour program level is in the morning or the afternoon each weekday and the Pop-Up Play program level offers morning or afternoon programs two weekdays per week. The scope of the review included: ● Review of site allocation process ● Review of the criteria and methodology used to determine the program level for each site ● Aligning the primary outcomes of the Summer Playground Program to community expectations Administration completed an extensive program review, which included the following engagement: ● Jurisdictional scan of similar programs in 11 Canadian cities; interviewed staff from four of the cities ● Comprehensive analysis of the 2018 parent satisfaction survey ● Internal review with City of Edmonton staff ● Stakeholder focus group with 12 community leagues ● Community league engagement through a survey to community league boards and members - 171 responses for 81 communities Key Learnings of the Review Feedback ● 95 percent of survey respondents are satisfied with the time of day and number of hours (2018 Parent Survey). ../2 - 2 - ● In order of preference, survey respondents prefer the Extended Hour program (94 percent), followed by the Standard program (90 percent). The Pop Up Play program is rated 73 percent by respondents (Community League engagement survey) Considerations for Site Criteria ● Use both attendance data and contextual knowledge of neighbourhoods to ensure the most appropriate distribution of the program levels. ○ Keep locations with consistent attendance in place for two years. ○ Calgary supports program locations with minimum attendance for two years before re-evaluating. ○ Hamilton reviews attendance by the hour to determine program volume/locations. ● Survey respondents indicated: ○ One program per neighbourhood should continue to be considered. ○ Minimum attendance should be necessary to continue as a program location beyond two years. Program Changes for 2020 Based on the above findings, Administration will implement the following changes in 2020: 1. Eliminate the Pop-Up Play program level. The Standard Hour program level will be the minimum level offered for a site. Administration will continue to identify up to 25 Extended Hour sites based on high social vulnerability data. 2. Establish a minimum average attendance in order to qualify for a Green Shack program. Neighbourhoods must meet an average two-year attendance of five or more children per hour. 3. Create a process for neighbourhoods to re-qualify as a program location. Program reconsideration will be based on updated park amenity and neighbourhood information. 4. Refine the hours of programming to enhance operational efficiencies. These changes will help set the foundation of the Summer Playground Program to ensure sustainability in years to come.

At the December 3, 2020 Urban Planning Committee, a request was made to have more information provided regarding what tools are currently being used to achieve more desirable operations of Short-Term Rental Accommodations (STR). Currently, there are an estimated 2100 hosts advertising on STR platforms. Administration reports 43 complaints associated with STRs (roughly 0.02%) between April 2018 and December 2019. However, we understand that while the majority of the 1 / 3 STRs are operating without complaints, of the complaints received some have a highly negative impact to both the neighbouring property and the community. In a review of the complaints that the City has received, the following concerns are typically noted: • Short-term rental operating without a business license (including concerns about the lack of requirements for some short-term rentals to obtain a business licence) • Short-term rental without on-site management • Untidy or unsightly yards due to debris and/or litter on the property • Garbage being placed out too early • Traffic - people frequently arriving to, and leaving from, a short-term rental • Parking - additional vehicles parked on the street • Parking - vehicles parked illegally Attachment 1 summarizes which City Bylaws address these concerns. Tools associated with each bylaw include tickets and fines. The Business Licence Bylaw also allows for a Business Licence review and placement of conditions on a licence (if required). Recent media stories have identified the use of Short-Term Rental Properties by large numbers of people for partying and illegal activities (i.e. violence, drugs and weapons). These extreme incidents are not common, nor are they indicative of the behaviours undertaken at the majority of short-term rentals. However, these extreme impacts are addressed through the Edmonton Police Service. Next Steps Administration will be bringing forward a report in response to the August 27, 2019 motion on February 25, 2020. Further opportunities to help manage the impact of Short-Term Rentals will be put forward for consideration. Administration is committed to utilizing the tools it has to manage the impacts of Short-Term Rentals while also working with citizens, industry and property owners to address concerns relating to STRs.

These changes were, in part, informed by findings from the Program and Service Review. Starting February 2, 2020, operational hours for 311 will be reduced to 12 hours from 24 (7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and closed on statutory holidays. Telephone response times will change from 25 seconds to 60 seconds. Support for essential public safety calls will continue to be available after hours. Examples of these essential public safety calls include; downed trees, manhole cover off on arterial road, sinkholes, dog attack etc. Moving forward the goal is to encourage Edmontonians to use digital channels first, such as Edmonton.ca and the numerous city apps. We know that to enable this shift, we must keep web pages updated with accessible and easy to understand information. In an effort to also manage emails to 311 more efficiently, we will be updating our email channel through an enhanced form - this will allow for the collection of mandatory information upfront and reduce the numerous back and forth emails due to missing information. As the way to email 311 will only be through the enhanced form, this will result in the decommissioning of the existing 311@edmonton.ca email address over the next several months. We recognize these changes will have impacts on Edmontonians and may result in greater volume of calls to your offices. City staff, who deliver services impacted by the changes, have been notified and a robust communications plan is in development to inform the public, using our networks and social media platforms. If you have any questions about the upcoming 311 service changes, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me or to Rob Klatchuk, Branch Manager of Engagement. CO/lm c.

In July 2019, City Council approved a new City policy that formalizes and clarifies the City’s role in supporting the homeless-serving system’s overall effort to support vulnerable Edmontonians during extreme weather conditions. As part of this response, Administration has secured space at the Commonwealth Community Recreation Centre for use as temporary overnight shelter, to supplement the existing services and response of the homeless-serving system of care. Administration and Homeward Trust is anticipated that shelters and other organizations will be able to handle the demand for beds; however, the space at Commonwealth Community Recreation Centre would be able to provide additional capacity for 36 individuals with room to expand as required. LRT stations will no longer be used as temporary shelter spaces. The space provided by the City will focus on reducing barriers to accommodate those who may experience challenges in accessing shelter options elsewhere. The space will also be separated and secured, with no interior access to the rest of the Commonwealth facility. Staffing at Commonwealth would include security personnel, trained City staff, and staff from community agencies with expertise in supporting people experiencing homelessness. The City, in consultation with Homeward Trust and community partners, will work together to determine when it is appropriate to activate the City’s extreme weather protocol. The decision will be based on Environment Canada weather warnings, the existing capacity of Edmonton’s emergency shelter system and emerging concerns at the drop-in centres serving those experiencing homelessness. In addition to the existing practice of transit express service picking up at most regular stops when the weather is -20°C and below with windchill, Edmonton Transit Service is also prepared to offer a dedicated bus route, travelling between emergency shelters, drop-in centres and designated City facilities, to ensure that transportation is not a barrier to accessing emergency shelter. This dedicated bus route would be free of charge and would be activated when the City’s temporary overnight shelter is activated. Each of the dedicated ETS buses will also have an outreach worker and Transit Peace Officer on-board. ../2 - 2 - During the day, Edmontonians may seek respite from extreme cold at recreation centres and libraries. The City also supports the Winter Warming Bus operated by Boyle Street Community Services, which provides food, winter clothing, blankets and transportation to warming centres and shelters. With temperatures expected to drop later this week, Administration is working closely with Homeward Trust who is monitoring weather conditions and agency capacity in real-time. A formal decision on whether to trigger the City’s extreme weather protocol is expected to be made within the next 48 hours. If the protocol is activated, a public advisory will be issued.

In January 2019, a Transition Team consisting of elected representatives appointed by each of the 13 regional communities began work to develop a business case for the establishment of an RTSC with the objective of better integrating transit service in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. This has been an independent regional initiative, led by the Transition Team noted above with support from Ernst & Young LLP.The City has participated actively in this process (Councillor Walters Co-Chairs the initiative with Councillor Wes Broadhead of the City of St Albert and Councillor Knack serves as alternate for the City of Edmonton) and provided logistical and technical support. The project was also funded by a $3.735M grant to this group from the provincial government. While all participating Administrations have been tasked with supporting this work through a regional RTSC Working Group and by providing extensive information to Ernst & Young to support the Transition Team’s work, this has been at its core a political initiative. City Administration has engaged business areas across the organization to provide opportunity to follow this work as it progressed, and to provide feedback and information to support its advancement. In addition, it was believed that it was essential Administration have an opportunity to identify risks and opportunities to their business areas based on the information in the report. To achieve this, an internal RTSC Working Group was established consisting of representatives appointed by their Departments. Biweekly meetings were held between August and November with the goal of sharing information on the work of the Transition Team as it coalesced, and identifying touchpoints and potential impacts on the City. This group has been guided by a simple question: What are the implications and opportunities for the City of Edmonton of the RTSC? These implications will be addressed as much as possible through a forthcoming report and two upcoming in camera discussions with the IRDC and Council. In advance of the public release of this report, we are sharing the Transition Team's report "" Accelerating Transit in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region: Building a Regional Transit Commission "" with Council to provide extra time for review. Administration will be bringing forward a presentation of this report by Ernst and Young for discussion by Council on two occasions prior to its public release: initially, in camera at the regular IRDC meeting on January 17 and secondly with full Council attendance at an in camera session scheduled for the January 20 City Council Meeting. This is consistent with the approach taken by all other municipalities in the region to allow a more complete understanding of the materials before the matter of our participation in the Commission comes before Council for a formal decision on February 19, 2020. To further assist in your understanding of the initial stage of this proposal including its impact on your ward, we are also offering an opportunity for ""geographically-themed"" meetings with small groups of Councillors to review ward level implications. All members of the RTSC Transition Team, and member municipalities, have committed to maintaining these documents, and any internal analysis of these documents, in camera at this time. We have collectively agreed to a public release of the Transition Team report on January 22, 2020. Please maintain the confidentiality of these documents until that time, in accordance with sections 21: Disclosure harmful to intergovernmental relationships and 25: Disclosure harmful to economic and other interests of a public body of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.

The new policy, with a focus on affordability and a person’s ability to pay, provides income-based discounts, simplified fare categories and encourages ridership growth. ETS fares remain competitive with other Canadian transit agencies and municipalities of similar size. Adjustments, effective February 1, include: ● Reduced cost for monthly Ride Transit Program passes from $35 to $34; ● Free transit for low-income seniors (with annual income less than $28,513 for a single person); ● Reduced cost for youth/senior ticket packs (10 tickets) from $23 to $19; ● Family Pass will become a permanent option based on a successful pilot in 2019 ● Increased maximum age of youth category to 24 years of age and under (formerly 17 and under) to help youth transition into the workforce; ● Senior monthly pass will be adjusted to $34 (youth monthly pass is $75; adult monthly pass is $97); ● Effective September 2020, the post-secondary fare category, currently offered to post-secondary students not enrolled in the U-PASS program, will be phased out. The U-PASS program remains unaffected. ETS customers will be notified of these fare adjustments through social media, digital screens in LRT stations and transit centres, station announcements, print and digital advertising, website updates, dedicated outreach to senior support agencies, the Edmonton Service Centre and 311.

In most cases, as was recommended in the Program and Service Review, cost savings will be obtained by targeting hours when facility utilization is very low, with weekends being a primary opportunity. New statutory holiday hours will also be implemented that will see some facilities closing on stat holidays and minor operating hour reductions at Clareview, Terwillegar and The Meadows. During statutory holiday closures, customers who have eligible memberships at closed facilities will be able to access the larger Community Recreation Centres at no extra charge. The following is intended to help your office answer any questions or complaints: General Email Response to inquiries: Thank you for sharing your concerns with my office. Operating hours at recreation centres were revised as part of a City-wide plan to manage tax dollars and budgets as effectively and efficiently as possible in 2020. In most cases, Administration revised times when facility use was lowest using sales and membership scan data. However, I understand that some customers will be impacted by the changes and I apologize for the inconvenience. I, and my Council colleagues, remain open to reviewing impacts as the year progresses to consider amendments where necessary. Thank you again for your email. Please feel free to contact us with any additional questions. FAQ Why have the hours at City Recreation Centres been changed? Our operating hours were revised as part of a plan to help the City manage its budget in 2020. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. How did you decide which facilities to reduce hours at? Hours were recently revised at all City recreation centres, with the exception of Kinsmen Sports Centre and Commonwealth Community Recreation Centre, as their operating hours were already reduced. In most cases, we targeted times when facility use was lowest using sales and membership scan data. However, we understand that some customers will be impacted by the changes and we apologize for the inconvenience. How much money does this save the City? Revisions to hours is just one part of a larger plan to help the City manage and meet current budgets, and it will save approximately $400,000 annually. Did the City consider lost revenue related to cancelled memberships? Yes, given the minimal adjustment to hours and the low utilization during these times, projections were made for lost revenue. For all adjustments, the expense savings and the potential impact on customers outweighed the risk of lost revenue. My facility is closing on a statutory holiday. I’m a member, what are my options? If you’re a Facility level: Monthly, Continuous Monthly or Annual member at a facility that has closed on a statutory holiday, your membership will be accepted at any of our open recreation centres. If you are a Facility member whose facility of choice is currently closed, your membership will be accepted at all Facility Plus and All Facility tier facilities during this time. Will hours change back to what they were? At this time, these hours will still allow us to serve the recreation needs of our community. We will monitor feedback and industry trends to determine if revisions need to be considered. I normally visit my facility at the times that have been reduced but did not know this was happening? All customers having visited facilities in the past 3 months during times that have been reduced were notified by email or mail. We also put information up in the facilities, on Cisco boards, and on the City of Edmonton website. I’d like to see all the changes that were made, where can I find the information? A notice including updated 2020 hours will be posted on each facility’s web page on January 13. On February 1, those operating hours will take effect. How does this change impact rental opportunities for sports teams, groups and events? Facilities and amenities will still be available to rent outside of advertised public hours","No",,,

It was quickly resolved and a small number of trains made it into service, but the power issue reoccurred at 5:40 a.m. The result was a large portion of LRT trains were unable to leave the LRT garage leading to significant delays to LRT service this morning. Just before 7 a.m., power was restored and trains continued to enter service, reducing the delay. Delays remained until roughly 8 a.m. City of Edmonton Position: Edmonton Transit Service initiated communications with customers about the delays via station announcements, social media, advertising TVs at all LRT stations, and on Transit App. Key Messages: ● We are working with EPCOR to get all trains running on schedule. ● We apologize for the delays and we are working to get everyone safely to their destination this morning. Approach : Communications will continue informing customers on social media. Media coverage: CBC radio was reporting on delays.

On January 8, 2020, the consultant doing the second level assessment notified the City of the heightened risk of a crack in the north pier of the northbound portion of the bridge. The inside lane of the northbound section has been closed to ensure there is no additional pressure on the cracked area. Repairs will be conducted over the next four weeks to allow for regular access to all lanes of the bridge. City of Edmonton Position: Keep the inside lane of the northbound bridge closed to allow crews access to the pier to perform repairs and alleviate loads. The work is expected to take up to four weeks and may require full closure of the bridge during off-peak hours. The Low Level Bridges (north and southbound) are also planned for renewal within this budget cycle (renewal construction scheduled to commence starting in 2022). Key Messages: ● The Low Level Bridges are inspected annually by our staff of fully qualified bridge inspectors. ● We are repairing a crack in the north pier on the northbound bridge, that was caught early thanks to regular inspections and maintenance. ● Identifying this repair before it became a major issue means our process works and regular inspections on the bridge are effective. ● We have a rigorous inspection and maintenance program for all of our bridges to ensure they are safe and accessible, including preventative maintenance on a yearly basis. Our inspections and maintenance go above and beyond the legislated requirements of the province. ● As a safety precaution, we have closed down the lane that passes over the area for about four weeks until repairs are complete. ○ The sidewalk will remain open, and bus routes will not be affected. However, we can anticipate there may be delays during peak hours. ● In parallel with the maintenance work, an in depth assessment is also continuing in preparation for the upcoming renewal work scheduled for this budget cycle. ● The City of Edmonton recognizes that the Low Level Bridges are a vital part of our transportation infrastructure. ● Considering the bridges have been maintained safely for so long is a testament to how well the City has historically looked after this bridge. ● The City’s priority is to preserve these bridges with renewal construction scheduled for 2022. Approach : A Traffic Disruption Notice and tweet have informed the public of the lane closure. We have also set up Dynamic Message Boards south of the bridge to alert motorists in real time for the duration of the work. As media inquiries come in we will direct them to the City Operations and IIS contacts as appropriate. Background: Media coverage on the Low Level Bridge from August 2019 has focused on its age and concerns of safety, especially with renewal scheduled to occur within this budget cycle. Public comments through letters to media and social media during that same time site dissatisfaction with the bridge’s look. The maintenance will likely allow people to again questions on the safety of the bridge and questions on whether renewal efforts could be moved up in the City’s construction schedule. Media coverage: None yet.

Eng. Deputy City Manager Subject: 2020 ETS Fare Changes On February 1, ETS fares, along with the description of some fare categories, will be adjusted based on the updated Edmonton Transit Service Fare Policy adopted by Council in late 2019. The new policy, with a focus on affordability and a person’s ability to pay, provides income-based discounts, simplified fare categories and encourages ridership growth. ETS fares remain competitive with other Canadian transit agencies and municipalities of similar size. Adjustments, effective February 1, include: ● Reduced cost for monthly Ride Transit Program passes from $35 to $34; ● Free transit for low-income seniors (with annual income less than $28,513 for a single person); ● Reduced cost for youth/senior ticket packs (10 tickets) from $23 to $19; ● Family Pass will become a permanent option based on a successful pilot in 2019 ● Increased maximum age of youth category to 24 years of age and under (formerly 17 and under) to help youth transition into the workforce; ● Senior monthly pass will be adjusted to $34 (youth monthly pass is $75; adult monthly pass is $97); ● Effective September 2020, the post-secondary fare category, currently offered to post-secondary students not enrolled in the U-PASS program, will be phased out. The U-PASS program remains unaffected. ETS customers will be notified of these fare adjustments through social media, digital screens in LRT stations and transit centres, station announcements, print and digital advertising, website updates, dedicated outreach to senior support agencies, the Edmonton Service Centre and 311.

This is in order to mitigate legal and reputational risks to the City and align our practices with other Canadian municipalities. City of Edmonton Position: This administrative change will be conveyed to citizens, community partners and stakeholders. Key Messages: ● After researching the best practices of other Canadian municipalities, and consultation with a number of City departments, Administration has decided to permanently remove the community flag pole from the grounds of City Hall. ● This research concluded that community flag poles should represent recognized countries, and not the causes of special interest groups. ● A number of Canadian municipalities have permanently cancelled their community flag-raising programs as a result of legal issues that have arisen over their program criteria. The City of Edmonton was facing the potential for similar reputational and legal challenges. ● The decision to permanently remove the City of Edmonton’s community flag pole is supported by the City’s Law Branch and the Indigenous Relations Office. ● Other options for community groups to seek recognition of their cause or event include the Light the Bridge program, request for a special proclamation, letter, certificate, or a unique message from the Mayor and/or, if they qualify, host an event in City Hall or on Sir Winston Churchill Square for their special day of recognition or remembrance. Approach : Administration will update the municipal website accordingly and will use this messaging to respond to any inquiries that are received.

This document contains “advice, proposals, recommendations, analyses or policy options developed by or for a public body” External and Intergovernmental Relations COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing Background: For a number of years, the City of Edmonton has had a community flag pole program. This program enabled community groups to submit online requests to raise their flag or banner in recognition of a significant anniversary; for example, the Loyal Edmonton Regiment - Liberation of Ortona, an annual day or week of recognition (Pride Week, National Lifesaving Week), or a visiting delegation (Nashville). Until recently, Administration coordinated the flag-raising with the requesting community group. Under this program, the community flagpole was booked and managed similarly to an equipment rental, as opposed to a formal ceremonial asset belonging to the City of Edmonton. Over the past several months, the City has received a number of sensitive/ controversial community flag pole requests. After internal discussions with Indigenous Relations and Law, and following a national jurisdictional scan to better understand how other cities manage their community flag poles, it was evident that an increasing number of Canadian municipalities (Vancouver, Nelson, Kamloops, Sarnia) are either removing these flag poles entirely or are creating very restrictive flag policies (Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary) to limit their political and legal risks. As a result of the potential legal and reputational risks to the City, Administration has decided not to relocate the community flag pole back from Homeless Memorial Park to the City Hall Plaza upon construction completion, and to remove the temporary flag pole that was stationed there in the interim.

We are working with the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), our partners at the Government of Alberta and local social service agencies to best address the challenging logistics of providing temporary accommodation options to those without permanent homes. The EOC has instructed the Emergency Support Response Team (ESRT) to transport cots, bedding and hygiene products to the Edmonton Expo Centre this evening in the event that we need to activate it. We are inspired by the generosity of Edmontonians as the EOC continues to compile contact information from citizens and businesses that are reaching out with offers of product donations or services. We will be sure to draw on these offers should we have the need. We are continuing to monitor business capacity to ensure compliance to new provincial orders under the provincial health emergency. The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) has reached out to us to create a conduit with our City enforcement teams to help address community concerns about non-compliance. We have established open channels of communications between EPS and City enforcement officers to help ensure expedited responses to complaints. Following numerous complaints from citizens about social distancing issues in-and-around downtown buildings, City enforcement officers will also follow up with building owners to work together to manage social distancing in accordance with Alberta Health Services (AHS) guidelines. Peace Officers and staff in City Hall will also now be extra vigilant monitoring the number of visitors to City Hall and in ensuring patrons observe social distancing guidelines. Officers ../2 - 2 - will closely monitor visitors for obvious signs of flu-like symptoms and help them to seek medical attention or determine if they have means to self-isolate. We are continuing to work through pressure points at our larger front counter service centre locations to manage patron lineups, social distancing, staff safety and ensuring adequate means to limit contact between patrons and staff. We are also examining new service delivery models using technology, online options and other methods to minimize potential staff exposure to COVID-19. For the safety of all staff, IT support is continuing to manage resources to accommodate those working from home. Like all of us, they are taking a view through a new lens. The Open City and Technology Branch’s goal is to help balance employee needs while maintaining capacity for critical infrastructure that will help ensure systems remain online and operational. Administration is also working with leadership from our unions on approaches to best manage staff and HR issues in the likely event union members are deployed into new operational areas to support vital work. Work flexibility discussions are scheduled and we are optimistic that an agreement can be reached to accommodate staff who want to contribute outside of their normal roles and responsibilities. Efforts are underway to develop lists of City workers for redeployment if and when they are needed. We are continuing to monitor and scan best practices and innovative solutions across other municipalities and jurisdictions. We are reviewing how others are managing various lines of business and whether there are lessons to be learned or opportunities to mirror when responding to transit changes, fee deferrals, payment options or other operational complexities. We also continue to evaluate our transit routes and needs on an ongoing basis as ridership and capacity fluctuates. Looking Ahead We will continue to monitor the situation with our vulnerable population in close cooperation with the EOC, province and social services.

Over the past 42 years, the staff at the Zoo have worked tirelessly to give Lucy the best care they can. Every decision made has always been in Lucy’s best interest and that has not changed. While she remains in good condition, she is an aging animal and the zoo team has noticed a general decline. As a result, in fall 2019, Administration completed a comprehensive health review of Lucy, including assessments from three qualified world-class veterinarians; two have examined Lucy previously, and one had no previous connection to the zoo industry. The experts were asked to assess not only Lucy’s health but whether she could safely travel. The reports from the assessing vets were very clear. Lucy has health issues, and, as we have been told previously, it is not safe for her to travel. The complete veterinarian reports, as well as a video of the assessments, can be found online at www.edmonton.ca/lucy . Lucy has no immediate life-threatening concerns and her health issues, while serious, are being managed well. The three visiting vets all commented on the exceptional care Lucy receives. Nonetheless, as an elderly animal, her needs are changing. As such, the elephant care team will continue to evolve its management program using international best practices. Lucy will continue to receive the best possible care here at Edmonton Valley Zoo for the rest of her life. Lucy is a beloved member of our zoo family and the Edmonton community and she will continue to be treated with the respect and dignity she deserves.

While the City has guidelines in place for tree protection and preservation through policy C456B (Corporate Tree Management Policy), it is often the case that trees, especially when they are located near construction sites, are damaged or lost due to inadequate protection measures. Hence a strong protection mechanism, like a bylaw, is essential to ensure the sustainability of the City’s urban forest. To align with other major municipalities in Canada (including Calgary, Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto and Halifax), Parks and Roads Services, with support from Development Services and Citizen Services, is proposing the development of a tree protection and preservation bylaw. This bylaw would provide a proactive mechanism to preserve and protect City trees from being damaged or lost and provide additional education to industry and the public on the importance of tree protection and best management practices. Although damage to City trees is referenced in the Traffic Bylaw (5590), the Parkland Bylaw (2202) and the Community Standards Bylaw (14600), they are a very small component of these bylaws. The focus of these bylaws are on recuperation of damages rather than tree protection and preservation. Based on the conversation at Urban Planning Committee on April 23, 2019 and subsequent discussion at City Council on April 30, 2019, Administration initiated a robust public engagement campaign and will present those findings to Urban Planning Committee through City Operations Report CR_7220 Corporate Tree Management Policy - Additional Public Consultation at the end of the quarter. Results from these public engagement activities conducted throughout fall 2019 show a significant level of support for a tree protection bylaw and the need for an easy to .../2 -2- understand process for tree protection and preservation. The project team received similar feedback from councillors and has been encouraged to pursue the development of a bylaw that is backed by robust public education. Next Steps: In the coming months, the project team will: ● Work with the Law Branch to develop a tree protection and preservation bylaw and outline procedures to support the bylaw; ● Engage with internal and external stakeholders to refine the bylaw and any supporting procedures; and ● Create a strong communications plan to ensure public education about the bylaw and the benefits of tree protection and preservation. The final draft of the bylaw will be presented to Council for approval in Summer 2020. Please extend your support and encourage your teams to provide input to the project. Working together, we will develop the bylaw and successfully deliver a mechanism that protects and preserves Edmonton’s urban forests which further the goals of ConnectEdmonton .

This process will define an approach to these types of projects that can be used consistently and improved upon over time. With this process, the City is also laying a foundation that will partially define the public’s perception of affordable housing; a foundation that will carry forward into future projects. Advocacy and Intergovernmental Updates Administration continues to advocate for permanent supportive housing with other orders of government. A request for funding will be resubmitted to the Government of Alberta for consideration in the next provincial budget expected at the end of February 2020. Administration continues to work closely with officials from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation to leverage the Mayor’s successful meetings with Deputy Prime Minister and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Freeland on January 6, 2020, and Adam Vaughan, the federal Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Children, Families and Social Development on January 14, 2020. On January 22, 2020, City Council approved Administration’s recommendation to include permanent supportive housing in the City’s submissions to both the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada for consideration in their upcoming budgets. Extreme Weather Protocol In 2019, City Council approved City Policy C620 - Supporting Vulnerable People During Extreme Weather Conditions, which formalized the City’s role in the system-wide response to supporting vulnerable Edmontonians during extreme weather conditions. On January 9, 2020, the extreme weather protocol was activated and, in consultation with Homeward ../2 - 2 - Trust and community partners, Administration opened the fieldhouse space within the Commonwealth Community Recreation Centre to provide temporary overnight shelter. The protocol ended on January 20, 2020, due to improved weather conditions, with an average of 100 people staying at the shelter per night over the course of its ten days in operation. The shelter was able to accommodate couples, pets, and shopping carts, and provided access to basic needs such as showers and washroom facilities. Administration is preparing a standard operating procedure to guide future activations and draw from lessons learned. Administration will continue to work with Homeward Trust and community partners to monitor shelter capacity and weather conditions for the remainder of the winter and will be prepared to reactivate the Extreme Weather Protocol if necessary. Bridge/Interim Housing Update Bridge housing addresses a gap for individuals moving out of homelessness by providing short-term (up to 90 day), continuous stay accommodation while they await placement into permanent housing. In December 2019, Administration presented a report to Community and Public Services Committee outlining the opportunity to provide bridge housing through the acquisition of an existing building (December 4, 2019, Citizen Services report CR_7228 - Reduction of Makeshift Camps). Committee directed Administration to develop a bridge housing proposal, including detailed project costs, for its consideration. Administration has since identified a vacant City-owned building that could serve as a viable bridge housing option in the near term. Administration is completing due diligence and minor renovation activities prior to seeking City Council approval of a nominal fee lease for a non-profit housing provider to operate the building as bridge housing.

In 2010, the Artists Urban Village (Edmonton chapter of the Performing Arts Lodges of Canada) and Arts Habitat were successful respondents on a City of Edmonton Request for Expressions of Interest for their proposal for the Artists Quarters development. The proposal consisted of a four-storey podium providing space for non-profit arts organizations and artists’ studios anchoring a 12-storey tower offering 64 live-work spaces. The City of Edmonton Cornerstones Program committed $8.35 million in land and grant funding to this project in 2012. An advance of $700,000 enabled the Artists Quarters project to progress through the conceptual design, rezoning and development permit stages. Further matching contributions from other orders of government and other ministries were necessary to make the project viable. Arts Habitat’s efforts to secure contributions from other orders of government and private fundraising have not been successful. In the absence of matching funding, Arts Habitat decided to cancel the project in July 2019. Since then, Administration, Arts Habitat and a private developer explored the viability of re-scoping the project on a different site within the Quarters. Arts Habitat determined the re-scoping to be impracticable at this time and prefer to renew their focus on other priority projects. Implications for City of Edmonton Commitments ● The original Cornerstones commitment of $8.35 million (less $700,000) including land assets and grant funding ends with the cancellation of the Artists Quarters project. Administration will return to City Council with a budget adjustment to reallocate the use of these funds. ● Administration will continue to support Arts Habitat in achieving its organizational mandate in the city overall and in particular for opportunities in the Quarters. For more information on the project’s history and relationship with the Cornerstones program, contact Colton Kirsop, Acting Director, Housing and Homelessness at 780-496-5538.

City of Edmonton Position: Staff at the EWMC advised Mike Lebreque and Edmonton Fire Rescue Services of a “pink smoke” situation at the Enerkem facility located at the EWMC site. Once notified Administration immediately connected with Enerkem communications staff asking for an update on the issue and key messages. Enerkem provided a statement to Waste Services at 2 p.m., which was shared with Communications and Engagement and then the media. Enerkem advised they were not planning to issue a news release at this time. Communications and Engagement has directed media to Enerkem. Enerkem built, owns and operates the Waste to Biofuels (Enerkem) plant at the EWMC . The City provides the primary feedstock, refuse-derived fuel converted from municipal solid waste, for the Waste to Biofuels facility. Key Messages: ● Fire Rescue Services received a call with reports of pink smoke at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre at 11:38 a.m. ● The smoke was contained and there was no fire. ● Staff returned to work as EFRS confirmed there were no safety or health concerns. Approach : Direct additional media inquiries to Enerkem communications. Background: Enerkem provided Administration with additional information, which was used in our response to media: Following a power failure at the Edmonton Alberta Biofuels (EAB) worksite (located at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre), there was a release of a substance that resulted in pink smoke at approximately 11:30 AM (MST) this morning. Edmonton Fire Rescue Services intervened quickly and deemed the area safe. This was immediately reported to Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP), Edmonton Waste Management Center (EWMC), and other area stakeholders. Please note that the quantity of substance that was evacuated in the air is below occupational exposure limits and there are no safety or health concerns for the people or the environment.

Reasons for the decision include a decline in attendance in recent years and cost. Staging the parade exceeds $160,000 annually. Cancellation of the parade will allow Northlands to redistribute the money into on-site programming. Attendees at K-Days have identified on-site programming as a priority. The situation facing Northlands is not unique. Changing times and demographics have prompted fairs and exhibitions in other communities to cancel their parade as well. Administration understands the decision made by Northlands executive team and respects that they are doing what they feel is most responsible for their organization and attendees. In these times of financial restraint across the province, Northlands has not asked the City for financial assistance in staging the parade. K-Days is 141 years old this year. While not having the parade will be a departure from previous years, I’m excited to see what is in store for the rest of the event. The decision to cancel the 2020 K-Days Parade will be announced in a media release by the Northlands Team later today. This information should remain confidential until that time.

The department has been undertaking process improvement, technology enhancement, and the overall culture of the department to support better service delivery. In 2019, the department reached major milestones in subdivision, rezoning, safety codes inspections, and many other areas. The work is continuing in 2020 with focus shifting to development permits, building permits, and business licenses. As you and your staff may receive questions or comments from these communities and residents, the following may be helpful in understanding what work is ongoing and what is underway. Recent/New Improvements underway: Online Building Permit Processing Times Recently, the department launched an online service dashboard for processing times for building permits and inspection. This dashboard gives applicants estimated timelines for their building permit applications. Administration continues to work to improve on its timelines while working with developers with complicated applications to ensure all requirements are met for their applications. Urban Form Business Transformation (UFBT) At the February 3 City Council meeting, the Planning and Development Business Model - Proposed Fiscal Strategy report was received. The video supplementing the UFBT Initiative is available. The UFBT Initiative improved several Planning and Development processes with positive responses from industry, customers and employees. Some of the UFBT improvements achieved include: ● Enhanced service of the Client Liaison Unit - edmonton.ca/clientliaison ● New rezoning process - edmonton.ca/rezoning ○ 2019 Performance: 160 days average across all application types ○ 2020 Improvement Targets ■ Complex: 160 calendar days average - resulting in a 20-30% anticipated reduction ■ Non-complex: 90 calendar days average - resulting in a 20-30% anticipated reduction ● Evolved subdivision process - edmonton.ca/subdivision ○ 2019 Performance: 220 days average ○ 2020 Improvement Target: 100 days average - resulting in a 55% reduction ● Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Safety Codes Inspections - it won an international Smart 50 Award ● Improved web content for planning and development services - edmonton.ca/permits Work also continued on digitizing permit applications, allowing customers to apply online through a simplified, enhanced experience. 14 services were newly digitized or enhanced in 2019, including commercial development and building permits, subdivision endorsements, and business licenses.

Permit & Licensing Improvement Initiative (new) Building on the success of UFBT, the 2-year, Permit and Licensing Improvement Initiative has just launched. It focuses on improving permit and licensing services for homeowners and contractors doing renovations, as well as business owners starting a new business or moving into a new space. An upcoming March 2020 report will provide additional detail about this exciting work. Client Liaison Unit The Client Liaison Unit provides enhanced service to developers of large, complex, or a-typical commercial, industrial, and large-site mixed-use projects. As a single point of contact, the CLU works with applicants to negotiate predictable timelines for project approval right-up-front and applies outcome focused project management to facilitate success. Currently 49 projects are being facilitated by the CLU. Recently CLU received positive praise on LinkedIn from well-known Calgary architect, Farhad Mortezaee, for their work in facilitating the timely approval of a Development Permit for a plastics manufacturing and recycling facility in the newly annexed industrial lands near the Edmonton International Airport. The project, an investment by Quebec-based Polykar Inc., was a lead received by Edmonton Global. The project represents nearly $20 million in investment in our non-residential tax base and when built will employ over 60 highly skilled staff. Development Bonds Approval of Development Bonds: Development Bonds are approved to be used by developers and will provide an alternative to Let","ters of Credit as a 5 year pilot. The implementation of the use of development bonds frees up capital for developers which they can invest in other projects. This approval has received support from developers and industry stakeholders. The pilot project starts April 2020. Ongoing service: Economic Development The City supports and helps advance its economy through a variety of business friendly initiatives including: Supports for Small Business: ● One on One Program - Small Business Supports - more than 2000 small business owners have been assisted with navigating processes and requirements in starting a business. ● Grants - Small business grants for Storefront Improvement, Development Incentive and Corner Store Program. ● Working with over +4500 member businesses in 13 Business Improvement Areas, providing workshops and hosting events. Support for Economic Development Partners: The City provides ongoing governance, strategy, and reporting support for economic development partners including EEDC (Innovate Edmonton), Edmonton Screen Industries Office (ESIO), Health City and TEC Edmonton. Business Retention and Expansion: This proactive and integrated program targets, assesses and assists small businesses and industrial companies. Staff are able to identify critical issues for business, utilize data and analytics to highlight opportunities/trends to help industries, and provide liaison service with City services such as planning, permitting and Client Liaison Unit.

Eng., Deputy City Manager","Alberta Collaborative Extended Producer Responsibility Study",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m_KBJBX1kJh-JISnmIhMAWJA3MilgMHU)","On April 2, 2019, City Council directed Administration to continue to work with and contribute $50,000 towards the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (AUMA) efforts to develop a baseline to inform the design of a provincial Extended Producer Responsibility program. AUMA released the study publicly on March 10, 2020 and the City of Calgary will be presenting a report to their City Council on March 18, 2020. The Alberta Collaborative Extended Producer Responsibility Study (ACES) report provides baseline information about recycling programs in urban and rural Alberta municipalities and the possible impacts to stakeholders of an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulatory framework in Alberta. The ACES report confirms that EPR can save taxpayer dollars, reduce waste and attract jobs and investment to Alberta. A group of municipalities, not-for-profit organizations and industry representatives were invited to guide the development of the baseline study. The Governance Committee consisted of representatives from: ● The City of Calgary (funding partner) ● The City of Edmonton (funding partner) ● The Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (funding partner) ● The Canadian Stewardship Services Alliance (funding partner) ● The City of St. Albert ● The Town of Whitecourt ● The Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) ● Alberta Ministry of Environment and Parks Report Highlights In 2018, Alberta municipalities spent approximately $107 million collecting and marketing 197,000 tonnes of packaging and paper products (PPP). With an EPR framework in place, that cost would be partially or wholly shifted to producers, many of whom are already financially responsible for managing end of life PPP in many other Canadian provinces. As many producers price their products similarly nationwide, these out of province recycling costs are already included in the price of products purchased in Alberta. A future EPR framework in Alberta should allow all Alberta municipalities the flexibility to continue to provide PPP services complementary to garbage and organics services. The report stresses the importance of ensuring future provincial EPR regulations stipulate that a producer funded and managed recycling system be easy for residents to use and understand, and is convenient, consistent and equitable across the province. The report recommends transferring responsibility for collection, post-collection and processing to producers, empowering producers to take responsibility and control of the end of life management of the PPP they supply into the market. It should also ensure that producers supplying quantities of PPP below an established threshold (small businesses) in Alberta are exempted from regulation, ensuring they are not unfairly affected. Stakeholder Engagement, Research and Communication 35 Alberta municipalities supported the ACES work by either passing motions, writing letters of support or supplying data to help develop the baseline information. The AUMA and RMA have both passed motions supporting EPR at their most recent conventions. The ACES consultant engaged Alberta’s urban and rural municipalities, First Nations and industry representatives. The ACES Governance Committee has delivered this report to the Government of Alberta to inform their work on recycling. Social, Environmental and Economic Impacts Triple bottom line benefits were determined as part of the future state vision of EPR in Alberta. It is estimated that an additional 21,000 tonnes of PPP would be recycled, increasing the total tonnes recycled to 184,000 annually. It is estimated that $4.7 million of disposal and collection costs would be avoided. About 219 full-time equivalent (FTE) direct, indirect and induced jobs would be created, resulting in a total of 1,581 jobs as a result of recycling PPP in Alberta. Finally, an additional 71,900 tonnes of CO2e emissions would be avoided, the equivalent to taking 15,000 passenger vehicles off the road annually. Most importantly, the $107 million currently being spent annually to manage the collection and processing of PPP will no longer be borne by Alberta rate payers.

Following the province’s lead today, I am announcing that we are activating our Emergency Operations Centre. We will continue to work closely with the Provincial Operations Centre to ensure that we are harmonizing our work and working together to keep Albertans and Edmontonians safe. We have adjusted a range of City services to reflect changing circumstances. One of them is transit. Today, Edmonton Transit Service began following a Saturday schedule in response to the COVID-19 situation. The decision to implement this reduced service was based on a need to ensure local critical service in the long term. Reduced service means that fewer operators are on the road, protecting the overall complement of operators, as COVID infection rates increase. It enables ETS to manage the health of drivers and ensure consistent and predictable service for patrons. The buses on the road all have driver shields, thereby protecting drivers through a physical barrier and greater social distancing. Fewer buses in operation means that more vigorous cleaning and disinfection can take place on the active fleet. Operationally, this is necessary. On the ground today, however, even though ridership has declined by 49%, the rider experience was not satisfactory and we are responding. In response to the situation this morning, ETS is making immediate adjustments to the Saturday schedule, adding more buses during the peak times between 3 and 6 o’clock today, on busy commuter routes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 17, and 112. Buses will be added on ten routes that have weekday service but do not have service on Saturday. This will improve service for passengers on routes 16 Express, 80, 83, 84, 92, 95, 122, 137, 182 and 331. Buses will also be put on standby, for quick response to overcrowding or if there is unanticipated demand. This gives ETS more flexibility, and more opportunity to address issues as they arise. It will continue this practice as needed. 2 ETS leadership will continue to monitor service levels and capacity in the coming days, adjusting to meet the needs of ridership, while balancing the need to protect the health and safety of operators so that it can deliver a resilient transit service through the duration of the COVID-19 situation. Another decision we have made today is to extend the March Transit Pass for low-income riders into April. This means that for this rider group, their March pass will suffice into the next month. Given that the March pass for ALL riders is differentiated only by a barcode on the back for low-income riders, we are currently determining how to communicate this change while preserving the dignity of these patrons. Please do NOT communicate this fact to your constituents or to the public, until we have sorted this out. The extension will be public at 2:00 pm today, but the practicalities are still being worked out. I am aware you are being contacted by your constituents. Enclosed are materials that you can use in your responses to them, and for posting on your social media accounts. We appreciate your patience as we remain responsive to shifting transit realities. We are monitoring hourly and adjusting as necessary. Should you have any further questions, please contact me or David Aitken, Chair of the COVID-19 Task Team, who is in constant contact with Eddie Robar. Attachments: 1. Key Messages 2.

He simultaneously announced aggressive new measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, along with the full level 4 activation of the Provincial Operations Centre (POC). City Administration followed the Provincial Government’s lead by activating the Edmonton Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) effective as of 2:30 p.m. today. The EOC will operate until 11:00 PM tonight due to St. Patrick's Day and will resume operations during normal business hours starting Wednesday, March 18. The EOC activation will modify how the current Task Team operates. The model for Task Team operational and communications support to the EOC will be communicated to Council once we work through the details. The Provincial State of Public Health Emergency does not override the City of Edmonton’s power to declare a state of local emergency. There is an established list of 11 criteria that guide decisions before such action is taken. The City’s Emergency Management Advisory Committee (EMAC) has not yet taken that step and will meet at 10 am tomorrow, Wednesday March 18, to determine a recommended course of action. As per Bylaw 19091 s. 10 (2), the EAC can declare a State of Local Emergency. Beginning tonight, Peace Officer and Bylaw Officer teams will be mobilized to ensure relevant organizations understand and comply with provincial orders announced today under the Provincial State of Emergency. Effective today, all events over 50 people are to be cancelled, attendance at recreation centres, casinos, bingo halls, bars, theatres and other facilities is prohibited, and sit-down restaurants can only remain open with lower capacity. The Government of Alberta also announced that municipalities, charitable and non-profit organizations providing social services support will immediately see $60 million to support their COVID-19 response. The funding will be provided to adult homeless shelters, women’s emergency shelters and the Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) program, which supports municipalities and civil society organizations in providing services to vulnerable Albertans. We will work with the Government of Alberta to determine how we may access this funding to help our most vulnerable population.

I’m very pleased to see the progress being made to activate the EXPO Centre in order to aid our most vulnerable citizens during this public health emergency. Sleeping cots have been set up and numerous supplies are on order, including portable washrooms and sanitary supplies. Building and site safety plans are being developed and will include collaborative input from Homeward Trust and AHS. Tomorrow, the Interim City Manager and members of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) will also visit the site. At the moment, there are two planned uses of the facility. It will serve as a location where individuals experiencing homelessness that are self-isolating or exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19 can receive medical services. Those who are not exhibiting symptoms can take part in day programming. The agencies are working this weekend to prepare for a soft opening of the day program. With the closure of recreation centres, libraries, and City Hall, there is an increased need for the day program. On Monday evening, AHS will test a separate partial opening of the medical services once satisfied that adequate measures required to maintain public health are in place. A full activation, with medical services and day programs, is anticipated on Tuesday. ETS buses will make stops at Boyle Street Community Services and Hope Mission to transport individuals wishing to participate in the day program to the EXPO Centre. We are working to take extra precautions such as rear door boardings, sectioned bus areas and extra assistance to help ensure the safety of any ETS staff asked to work these routes. ../2 - 2 - Media will not be permitted on site once EXPO is activated to protect the privacy and dignity of individuals, protect the health and safety of media and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 transmission. With the spring-like weather today, we are seeing a significant increase in city park usage and related overflowing parking lots. We are receiving a few reports of groups of people not observing social distancing orders announced under the Provincial Health Emergency. Larger groups of people were observed skating and congregating in off-leash dog areas and on bridges, enjoying the sunshine. We will continue to monitor the parks, educate and encourage visitors to maintain social distancing. Terwillegar Off-Leash Dog Park, March 21, 2020 Looking Ahead We will continue to manage the operational and logistical challenges associated with making the EXPO Centre fully operational to assist our vulnerable population in close cooperation with the EOC, province, AHS and Homeward Trust.

Please find a summary below of the activities: ● Deputy Fire Chief Rob Squire, Director of the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), the Emergency Support Response Team (ESRT), Edmonton Police Services, Peace Officers, and Edmonton Transit Service continued working with Community and Social Services, Alberta Health Services, Homeward Trust and community partners to help create a safe space at the Edmonton EXPO Centre for community members experiencing homelessness ( News Release ). ○ Isolation Shelter (24/7) - Location on-site: Halls E-H ○ Day Drop-in (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. - 7 days per week) - Location on-site: Hall A ● Offers of donations for goods and services continue to roll in at a consistent rate and the EOC is cataloging services, equipment, and products. ● This afternoon, the City announced closure of the majority of in-person service centres effective tonight. The Animal Care & Control Centre will continue to be available by appointment only. Where possible, services will be offered online . Alberta Supports Centres also announced closure of GOA service centres. ● Following the provincial declaration of a public health emergency, we proactively inspected numerous businesses and public gathering locations today and over the weekend. ○ 50 grocery stores were found to be open, managing line ups and displaying signs reflecting the Alberta Health Services (AHS) guidelines. ○ Nearly 200 sitdown restaurants were visited between March 19 and March 22, of which 26% were found to be open. ../2 - 2 - ○ Approximately 40 religious assemblies were visited, of which 50% remained open and all were in compliance. ○ Approximately 50 fast food establishments were visited, of which 27% were found open and all were in compliance. ○ Construction sites, big box stores and other businesses visited showed social distancing in accordance with AHS direction. ○ City enforcement officers also observed numerous playgrounds, parks, off-leash dog areas, river valley trails and running stairs with increased use. At this time, we are focusing on educating the public and reinforcing AHS guidelines over fines or penalties when we notice groups of people not observing physical distancing recommendations. ● Some jurisdictions in Alberta have closed public playgrounds due to concerns about the inability to ensure playspace surfaces are cleaned and disinfected. In addition, large groups of people and pets congregate in close contact at these locations. City Park Rangers monitored more than 110 Edmonton park playgrounds today for instances of non-compliance. ● We are closely monitoring recent decisions by the governments of Ontario & Quebec as they announced closure of all non-essential business. In addition, steep new fines were announced by Vancouver for individuals and businesses not observing social distancing orders. Looking Ahead We will continue to manage the operational and logistical challenges associated with making the EXPO Centre fully operational. We will also continue to closely monitor business and public spaces for non-compliance to AHS orders. Please note the additional resources below to provide you with the latest COVID-19 information.

Attendance numbers for the first day: ● Isolation Shelter (24/7) - Location on-site: Halls E-H: Attended to six individuals overnight last night in the health unit and the EOC is anticipating approximately a dozen individuals needing care overnight tonight. ● Day Drop-in (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. - 7 days per week) - Location on-site: Hall A: The location has an Alberta Health Services (AHS) exemption for mass gatherings and social distancing is monitored. The drop-in saw an average attendance of approximately 150 persons at any point in time, peaking at 217 people. Action plans by Administration in support of EXPO are modified on a daily basis, subject to attendance and conditions. Changes in daily action plans are reflective of the fluidity of the changing environment. The operation of the EXPO centre is putting additional strain on the supply chain for gloves, masks, sanitizers and other personal protective equipment that are in short supply globally. Park Rangers and City Operations staff started immediately implementing today’s I/City Manager direction to close down playgrounds. We estimate that there are more than 410 playground facilities, structures or amenities that will need to be closed to the public, situated within more than 400 City of Edmonton parks. The structures will be cordoned off with caution tape today and tomorrow. Signage will begin appearing as soon as possible to notify visitors that the structures are no longer accessible. In addition, we are reaching out to school superintendents who manage 15% of the Edmonton playgrounds to ask for similar measures. We anticipate that superintendents will follow the City’s lead and close their play structures to public access. ../2 - 2 - New signage will also begin rolling out this week, advising the public to maintain physical distancing in high-traffic outdoor City-owned spaces such as parks, trails and running stairs. COVID-19 is undoubtedly stressful for many in our city but it is important to remember that there is a lot of good being done by communities and individuals around the country, including right here in Edmonton. Here are some inspirational examples of community building from across Canada and here at home. Looking Ahead We will continue to manage the operational and logistical challenges associated with making the EXPO Centre fully operational.

We saw a surge in use on day two and expect rising numbers in the short term. We are continuing to review our ETS transportation logistics and adjust our operations as we work with our partners to transport vulnerable passengers to and from the EXPO Centre. Attendance numbers for yesterday, Tuesday, March 24: ● Isolation Shelter (24/7) - Location on-site: Halls E-H: Had 13 individuals showing symptoms admitted for isolation and overnight stay. ● Day Drop-in (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. - 7 days per week) - Location on-site: Hall A: The drop-in saw 447 visitors during operational hours.

The EOC has established a new email address for messages related to donations of goods and services. Please direct any public or agency inquiries to the donation management email for consideration and cataloging. Today, Premier Jason Kenney announced new amendments to the Procedures Regulation under the Provincial Offences Procedures Act. These amendments empower community peace officers, in addition to police, to issue tickets enforcing COVID-19 public health orders. He also announced that the Government of Alberta and Alberta Health Services are working with local enforcement agencies to manage complaints, which can be submitted online . We will thoroughly review today’s announcement to determine how these new measures may reasonably be enforced and any impact they may have in relation to our State of Local Emergency. ../2 N/R - 2 - The Government of Alberta also announced that Albertans who are self-isolating and unable to work can now apply online for emergency one-time funding from the province. Successful applicants are eligible to receive a one-time payment of $1,146 meant to bridge the financial support gap until emergency federal funding becomes available. The Critical Infrastructure Strategic Impact Survey was also launched. Questions are intended to assist provincial planners and decision makers in identifying strategic issues to be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic response. Today, I also have some really positive news to share. The Corporate Procurement and Supply Services team have gone the extra mile to source badly-needed hand sanitizer. Yesterday they found a producer that was able to supply bulk hand sanitizer but it arrived in three 45-gallon barrels. Some quick thinking employees found 3,000 refillable liquid soap dispensers and a team of ESRT volunteers filled the containers, which were sent off to transit garages so operators have crucial hand sanitizer while on the job. Below is a picture of this innovative solution in action! 17(1) - 3 - Edmonton isn’t alone in finding new ways to help in a crisis. City/Share Canada has many examples of how Canadian communities are also responding with creativity and imagination . Looking Ahead We will be closely examining the new provincial amendments and the impact they will have on our enforcement operations. We will also continue to monitor local businesses for non-compliance violations that could lead to further spread of COVID-19. Additionally, we will also keep watch for more uplifting stories from citizens and staff to share with you.

In addition, Adam Laughin, Director of the Emergency Management Agency, invoked three emergency orders . These SOLE orders allow for enforcement of physical distancing and self isolation, and compel Personal Services businesses (storefront, home based, mobile service), including but not limited to, tattoo parlours, hair salons, barber shops, nail salons, health spas, tanning salons and body rub centers to cease operations until further notice. A news conference with Mayor Don Iveson and Adam Laughlin was held immediately after the Committee meeting and a news release was issued to outline the action the City is taking to protect residents and businesses from COVID-19. Rob Squire, Deputy Fire Chief and Director of the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), continued to oversee the complex logistics associated with ongoing operations at the EXPO Centre to provide resources and accommodations for Edmonton’s vulnerable population.

The Mustard Seed has closed its 40-bed emergency shelter, located in a church off Whyte Avenue, to open a 180 mat overnight shelter in the field house at the Kinsmen Sports Centre. Starting tomorrow night, Friday, March 27, ETS will provide morning and evening transportation between Kinsmen and the EXPO Centre. We will continue to work with our community partners to assess their needs as they evolve. Following the closure of most in-person City service centres, a YouTube video was unveiled to advise Edmontonians that they can still access most services online, by phone or by email. I’ve heard your concerns related to the cleanliness of the vehicles for hire including taxis, Ubers and airport limos. We are working with local service providers as well as the Edmonton International Airport and other jurisdictions to align our inspection and enforcement procedures to make sure that rigorous cleaning of vehicles for hire is taking place to help stop the spread of COVID-19. We will continue to monitor for non-compliance and determine whether further measures are necessary. Yesterday we shared a story about fantastic teamwork by City employees in sourcing, bottling and distributing hand-sanitizer. Today we were made aware of a potential offer from the University of Alberta to provide hand sanitizer to the City of Edmonton. We will be sure to follow up to see if the product is suitable for use. Looking Ahead We continue to closely review the new provincial amendments and the impact on our enforcement operations. We will actively reach out to owners and operators of Personal Services businesses affected by today’s order to ensure awareness and compliance. We will also continue to monitor and patrol other businesses, playgrounds, trails, outdoor stairs and off-leash dog parks to ensure physical distancing orders are being observed.

These measures order the closure of several more categories of close contact businesses beyond the order invoked under Edmonton’s renewed State of Local Emergency. Our enforcement approach to physical distancing in local parks and open spaces will also need to be adjusted based on today’s new provincial measures due to reduction in allowable groups size. Effective immediately, provincial restrictions will be in place for the following classifications of business: ● Close contact businesses including hair salons and barbershops, tattoo and piercing studios, esthetic services, as well as wellness studios and clinics and non-emergency and non-critical health services provided by regulated health professionals or registered professionals including dentistry, physiotherapy, massage, podiatry, chiropractic and optometry services. ● Dine-in restaurants will no longer be able to offer dine-in service. Take-out and delivery services will continue to be available. ● Non-essential retail services that fall into the categories of clothing, computer and gaming stores, and services in shopping malls and shopping centres such as hobby and toys, gift and specialty items and furniture. In addition, people are prohibited from attending gatherings of more than 15 people and they must observe two metres of social distancing. This includes: ● open spaces such as trails, fields and parks ● public and private gatherings where people are brought together in a single room or space at the same time, including funerals, weddings and other formal and informal events. ../2 - 2 - The Federal government also announced a 75 percent wage subsidy for qualifying businesses, for up to 3 months, retroactive to March 15, 2020. This is expected to help our local businesses to keep and return workers to the payroll. Nicole Poirier, Director, Civic Events & Festivals, Citizen Services facilitated the establishment of a governance model for ongoing operations at the EXPO Centre. The new model will see day-to-day operations at the EXPO centre managed using the Incident Command System (ICS), a standardized on-site management system designed to enable effective, efficient management and integration of resources within a common organizational structure including facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications. City Administration will lead the on-site Incident Command Post (ICP) with support from agency and provincial government partners. The ICP will be supported by the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and by Rob Squire, Deputy Fire Chief and EOC Director . This will help to expedite and streamline City support services such as peace officers, security and transit. The EXPO Centre continued to see growth in both areas with the following attendance numbers recorded for yesterday, Thursday, March 26: ● Isolation Shelter (24/7) - Location on-site: Halls E-H: Had 35 individuals showing symptoms admitted for isolation and overnight stay. ● Day Drop-in (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. - 7 days per week) - Location on-site: Hall A: The drop-in saw 550 visitors during operational hours. The overnight shelter in the field house at the Kinsmen Sports Centre being operated by Mustard Seed, with support from the City of Edmonton, saw an overnight attendance of approximately 60 people. We are anticipating increased attendance numbers tonight. We also anticipate activating the Central Lions Recreation Center as a shelter for vulnerable people on Monday, March 30. We will be working with Hope Mission to ensure rigorous cleaning protocols are followed and to determine any other support they may need from the City. Yesterday, I shared with you a link to our EOC for Edmontonians to donate goods to support operations of centres such as these. The Alberta Emergency Management Agency is also accepting donations through the Unsolicited Offers Program . Following the personal services closure order invoked yesterday by Adam Laughlin, Director of the Emergency Management Agency, City Enforcement Officers completed 300 notifications and site visits to businesses last night and completed 700 by 2 p.m. today. Officers and field staff are reporting that education, awareness and voluntary compliance is going well. During yesterday’s Emergency Advisory Committee, you had asked questions regarding the current status of indoor shopping malls.","ng malls. Early checks of some of Edmonton's major malls - 3 - indicate that they are completely shut down or in very limited operations. City Centre Mall has about 90 percent of businesses closed. We will continue to monitor larger malls across Edmonton for usage and non-compliance issues. Good News Stories I am pleased to have several good news stories to share with you from across Edmonton. Last night I shared a story about the University of Alberta producing hand sanitizer in its labs. I’m pleased to say that we were able to connect with their labs today and staff picked up 200L of sanitizer. We also sourced another 700 dispensers from a local big box store. We will begin putting the sanitizer into smaller containers on Monday for distribution as needed. We have also managed to source a limited supply of some other items of personal protective equipment from other supply channels. This morning an ETS transit operator was interviewed by media outlets at the Kathleen Andrews garage regarding his decision to volunteer to operate the shuttle bus between Boyle Street and Expo Centre. He is the same operator who saved a man from freezing to death in a bus shelter last February and is once again displaying his selfless actions as an ETS employee. A story will be appearing on the TransformingEdmonton blog shortly. Finally, City collectors received this ""thank you"" from a resident in the McLeod Ridge area that shared their appreciation of our collectors' continued efforts during this trying time - 4 - Looking Ahead We continue to closely review the new provincial orders announced today and the impact on local business and our enforcement operations.

Relative to open spaces and the new 15-person limit for gatherings and the requirement for two metre distancing , this weekend Peace Officers were out at the City’s parks to monitor for appropriate physical distancing. Edmontonians are so far maintaining the required two metre separation in open spaces. Officers observed good compliance at the top 10 most popular dog off leash parks at midday on March 29, with 40 to 50% utilization overall. By 3:00 pm, both Jackie Parker and Terwilliger dog parks were at 60 to 70% capacity. As the weather grows warmer, monitoring will continue, and action will be taken as needed should problems arise with crowding and physical distancing. Compliance among Personal Services businesses was confirmed through more than 4,600 inspections and calls to business since the City’s SOLE Order last Thursday. Officers have observed very good results, with about 99% compliance among those businesses as of today. Edmonton Transit Service is working to seek clarification from the Government of Alberta on the 15 person gathering exemption and the two metre distancing requirements. The clarification aims to ensure reasonable Edmonton transit ridership capacity, physical distancing, and adherence to the new guidelines. Efforts will be undertaken to educate citizens about limiting use of public transportation for essential needs as ridership numbers normalize as a result of many business closures. High volume routes will see additional bus allocation as transit balances ridership demand with distancing requirements. We anticipate it may take a day or two to get to the appropriate level. ../2 - 2 - The EXPO Centre continued to see growth in both areas with the following attendance numbers recorded for Friday, March 27 and Saturday, March 28: ● Isolation Shelter (24/7) - Location on-site: Halls E-H: Had 35 individuals showing symptoms admitted for isolation and overnight stay on Friday, and 44 on Saturday. ● Day Drop-in (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. - 7 days per week) - Location on-site: Hall A: The drop-in saw 593 visitors during operational hours on Friday, and 461 on Saturday. Given the growing number of people seeking services at EXPO Centre, efforts are underway to expand into Hall B to increase capacity towards 1000 visitors per day. The overnight shelter in the field house at the Kinsmen Sports Centre being operated by Mustard Seed, with support from the City of Edmonton, saw an overnight attendance of approximately 94 people on Friday, and 119 people on Saturday. Good News Stories Through our EOC Donation email, the City received a pallet load of hand sanitizer. These supplies are now being distributed across different operational areas. Looking Ahead Phase two of closures of non-essential businesses (i.e. Government of Alberta Impacted Business List) has started to gain voluntary compliance. City of Edmonton Legal Services is providing assistance in interpreting which businesses must close starting Monday, March 30. The Central Lions Recreation Center as a shelter for vulnerable people is opening as planned on Monday, March 30.

Government of Canada - Prime Minister’s comments today to mark World Health Day : “we mark World Health Day at a time when we are facing a rapidly evolving global pandemic. To fight the outbreak of COVID-19, Canadians and people around the world have had to change how we work, how we play, and how we stay connected with our loved ones and communities. We are all in this together, and we must each do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19.” - Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Canadian Heritage, announced today that the Government of Canada is investing $3 million in several organizations through the Digital Citizen Initiative’s Digital Citizen Contribution Program. This funding will help combat false and misleading COVID-19 information as well as the racism and stigmatization that are often the result. Funded projects will reach Canadians on a national and local scale, online and offline, in minority communities, in both official languages and in Indigenous communities . Government of Alberta - Premier Kenney made an address to the province (6pm, Tuesday) in which he provided data and modelling on the expected progress of the coronavirus through Alberta’s population. Details will be provided in tomorrow’s update. - The Government of Alberta introduced two new bills at the Legislative Assembly today: - Bill 13: Emergency Management Amendment Act, 2020 (No. 2) . This introduces further amendments to the existing act. Proposed amendments include allowing states of local emergency to last for 90 days. Overall the amendments appear to be positive, although there are still some unknowns. Adding the specific offence is a big win, even if it requires some procedural work to figure out how to use it. AUMA has indicated that they will be making a positive statement in the media about the latest changes to the Emergency Management Act . More detailed analysis is found here . - Bill 8: Protecting Survivors of Human Trafficking Act . While this Bill is not related to COVID-19, it was introduced for first reading today. If passed, the proposed legislation will extend the definition of sexual exploitation to persons of all ages, make it easier for survivors to get protection orders, enable police to take quicker action to rescue survivors, allow survivors to sue traffickers, and create an awareness day to make Albertans more aware of this important issue. Other Big Cities City Watch - online tracking tool on how 48 Canadian cities are responding to the COVID-19 crisis; managed by the Canadian Urban Institute. Toronto - Many staff who are not in essential or critical roles are being redeployed to other areas to help the City continue to deliver essential, critical, and priority services during this time. Additionally, as a temporary measure, approximately 5,400 recreational workers that are normally hired at this time of year are not being hired because of the cancellation of spring recreation, arts and museum programs. - Financial pressure estimated at $65 million a week. The pressure is driven by decreased Toronto Transit Commission and other revenues, coupled with increased costs.

The alleged “coughing” attack on an ETS operator and Peace Officers on Sunday was particularly troubling. The behaviours we are witnessing have complex root causes. Understandably, ETS employees and ATU Local 569 are concerned for Operator safety and health. I share that concern, and we are continuing to take action. Since the decision was made to adjust service levels a few weeks ago, daily incremental changes have been made within ETS to continue to deliver reliable service and help to manage operator safety. Last week, we struck a working group made up of City leaders from Community Development, ETS and Community Standards, and external social service organizations. That group continues to meet daily, and is making regular recommendations for additional incremental adjustments to our approach. An immediate next step is a solution for LRT that encourages and emphasizes destination-driven travel only. It is founded on the premise that aimless travel is a health risk to all Transit users. It will focus on ensuring all passengers disembark at Century Park and NAIT stations, to allow for thorough cleaning of LRT cars at the end of each trip. Working with NET resources, Transit Peace Officers will direct those who are traveling without a specific destination to a shuttle service to downtown, or to one of the social support locations (EXPO Centre, Central Lions or Kinsmen) as appropriate. The success of this solution will guide whether it will be expanded to those bus routes that have higher incidents of aimless travel. Eddie Robar and I have each personally spoken with ATU 569 President Steve Bradshaw, and he supports this approach. This latest action is one of many that have been taken over the past several weeks. To follow is a recap of our incremental approach. At the core of each action is a commitment to employee and public health and safety. Safety Measures for Operators ● Adjusted service so all in service buses have Operator shields - this includes switching the community buses to 40’ buses so they could have shields ● Adding extra service, where possible, to address remaining overcrowding issues. ● Temporary fare suspension to eliminate transfer use, implement rear door boarding and encourage further distancing from Operators ● Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting of all buses, LRT, DATS vehicles, transit centres, LRT stations as well as high touch areas in individual and shared workspaces using a safe disinfectant known to kill the virus ● Distributing hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes to front line employees and closely monitoring soap levels at Operator washrooms at transit centres. ● Service suspension of Route 747 for travellers ● Removing brochures from all buses to prevent the spread of germs ● Operators to alert Control when their bus starts to reach half capacity ● Heightened presence of security guards and Peace Officers where they will actively patrol buses, trains, and other transit property ● Occupational Health & Safety has also completed a COVID-19 hazard assessment for ETS and have determined face masks and gloves for operators are not needed at this time given the protective measures we have already put in place. ● The EXPO shuttles are a specialized service that have the additional measure of a vapour barrier. A social worker travels in the back with the clients and a manual ramp is available for the back door, if it is required. Staff, rather than the Operator, set-up and dismantle the ramp. Actions to Support Vulnerable Populations ● Working with Neighbourhood Empowerment Team or NET (a partnership of the City, Edmonton Police Service, The Family Centre and United Way of Alberta Capital Region) and REACH to complete a scan of non-destination riders and their specific needs ● Prioritizing Operator alerts for sleeping patrons, riders with no destination, intoxicated passengers or those threatening any staff member Communications Efforts ● Despite an over 70 per cent reduction in ridership, the City actively continues to encourage customers to stay home, only make essential transit trips, travel off-peak, and practice physical distancing. ● Add destination sign messaging and automated announcements on the train to “board at rear, if able” when using the bus. This is an extremely complex situation. We are working to strike the right balance between treating vulnerable populations with care and compassio","nd compassion, and continuing to operate a transit service that is safe for all riders who rely on it for essential trips. As always, the health and safety of City employees and the public is our top priority. I will keep you updated as we evaluate the effectiveness of this next step to address transit safety concerns. Please reach out to my office if you have any questions. AL/tl 2","No",,,

Government of Canada ● The Prime Minister announced temporary changes to the Canada Summer Jobs program that will help employers hire summer staff and provide young Canadians access to the jobs they need during this unprecedented time. The temporary changes to the program for this year include: ○ an increase to the wage subsidy, so that private and public sector employers can receive up to 100 per cent of the provincial or territorial minimum hourly wage for each employee ○ an extension to the end date for employment to February 28, 2021 ● Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced further flexibility on the eligibility criteria for businesses to access the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). ○ All employers have the flexibility to compare their revenue of March, April and May 2020 to that of the same month of 2019, or to an average of their revenue earned in January and February 2020 (this latter flexibility was added today). ○ For March, the Government proposes to make the CEWS more accessible than originally announced by reducing the 30-per-cent benchmark to 15 per cent, in recognition of the fact that many businesses did not begin to be affected by the crisis until partway through the month. ○ Charities and non-profit organizations will be allowed to choose to include or exclude government funding in their revenues for the purpose of applying the revenue reduction test. Government of Alberta ● Alberta Health’s modeling projections about the Covid-19 threat to public health (highlighted by the Premier last night in his address and shared publicly today): ○ The rate at which infections are growing is much lower in Alberta than many other parts of the world. So far, our infection rate more closely resembles countries that have successfully fought the virus, like South Korea, than the sharp upward rise seen in countries like Italy, Spain, and the U.S. ○ We have two models: a probable scenario, and an elevated one. For questions, please contact: Yetunde Oke, Intergovernmental Affairs, 1 s.17(1) ■ Under the “probable scenario,” we now project that Alberta will hit the peak of infections in mid-May. From the beginning of the outbreak to the end of summer we could see as many as 800,000 total infections, and between 400 and 3,100 deaths. ■ Under the more serious but less likely “elevated scenario” we would see infections peak at the beginning of May, with as many as 1 million total infections, and between 500 and 6,600 deaths. ○ Our experts project that if we had no social distancing and public health orders in place, we could experience as many as 1.6 million infections, and 32,000 deaths in Alberta – as many as 640 deaths per day. Our health system would collapse under the chaos of that scenario.

Key Messages: ● These are unprecedented times. COVID-19 is having an impact on public health, City services, our economy and our workforce. ● While today’s release shows a marginal uptick in the unemployment rate for March, we expect we will have a clearer picture on how the outbreak is impacting the region’s workforce once April data are released. ● We recognize that every labour statistic is an Edmontonian and that a rising unemployment rate means more Edmontonians looking for work. ● Even though this is an era of physical distancing, this economic data highlights the importance of family and community connections. We will get through this together. ● Let me reassure you -- we will recover. We don’t know how soon, but we do know that our community and our city have the right fundamentals in place. ● As a community, we are connected, educated, and innovative. We have talents the world needs. ● As a City government, our immediate focus is on operational matters for staff, and public health matters for Edmontonians. We are focusing on how we respond .

Further to that discussion, please find additional information below: Formal Operating Procedures All Operators (conventional bus, DATS, LRT) are provided with a manual outlining formal operating procedures that staff are expected to follow. The most recent manual update was shared in March 2020. The operating procedures are part of in-class formal training for Operators and includes instructions specific to emergency situations. Updates are regularly provided to all operational staff (including Operators, Inspectors, Dispatchers, and the Control Centre) via Operator Notices. Transit Safety The Control Centre monitors the Operator and passenger experience for every in-service train, bus, LRT station and transit centre. The monitoring includes staff and public interaction through emergency calls and proactive security surveillance of transit locations. For example, when help phones are triggered, cameras are set to view the help phone immediately. ETS also has the capability to monitor buses in real-time to assist in the management and response to emergency situations and security incidents. Each situation is assessed on a case-by-case basis by trained Control Centre staff who are able to dispatch the appropriate responders, such as police, EMS, Peace Officers and/or Transit Inspectors. In 2019, all 1,700 bus and LRT Operators received training on how to manage difficult and dangerous situations such as how to de-escalate a disruptive passenger or how to respond to threats. After an incident or as part of the COVID-19 response, Operators are offered peer support and relieved of duties with pay if they feel they cannot continue on their shift. They also have access to counselling through the Employee and Family Assistance Program and, if appropriate, could be supported in navigating the Workers’ Compensation Board claims process. An investigation may also take place to review the incident. From these reviews, Administration incorporates lessons learned into future actions and continuous improvement. .../2 -2- COVID-19 Response In the April 2, 2020 daily COVID-19 Update to Council ETS implemented safety measures were shared In working with our Occupational Health and Safety partners, we have completed a COVID-19 hazard assessment and Personal Protective Equipment has been distributed accordingly. We continue to follow advice from Alberta Health Services and adjust as needed. To date, over a dozen interim steps have been added to protect the public and Operators, including adjusting service to enhanced Saturday service levels, using buses with shields to create a physical barrier between Operators and passengers, temporary fare suspension, rear door boarding and installing signs on bus seats to support physical distancing, introducing an approach to limit non-destination riders traveling on transit, and enhanced security and cleaning, to name a few. Frontline feedback is essential to the task team. As such, Directors and Supervisors have been asked to escalate Operator safety feedback to the Branch Manager as soon as possible. Further, if an employee has a high-risk family member or is high-risk, the employee can self-identify to their Supervisor and Workforce Safety and Employee Health will provide options to support their health and safety . Passenger Safety and Security on Transit Passengers have several options to report observations and incidents. These include approaching a uniformed ETS employee or contracted security guard, activating an emergency help phone (located in every transit centre), passenger alarms on board each LRT train, and calling Transit Watch or 911 in the event of an emergency. Additional information on ETS security personnel, safety education programs, bus and rail safety and personal safety tips are available online for passengers. The health and safety of Operators and passengers has always been our highest priority. Administration continues to monitor safety and security data through the corporate working group established to address challenges that occur from the City’s COVID-19 response. This working group meets daily to discuss emerging safety issues to ensure we are responding to such challenges quickly. We also maintain regular contact with the Union to ensure we are aware of the concerns they are receiving and they are aware of the ongoing preventative actio","f the ongoing preventative actions we are implementing. If you have any questions or concerns please contact Eddie Robar, Branch Manager of ETS, at eddie.robar@edmonton.ca. c: Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk Steve Bradshaw, President of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 569  KEY ACTIVITIES COVID-19 AT A GLANCE ● News Release: the State of Local Emergency was renewed at the Emergency Advisory Committee meeting with Council and new measures were announced followed by a media availability with the Mayor, Adam Laughlin and David Aitken. ● Transit: A news conference was held this morning with David Aitken, Eddie Robar, and Jackie Foord to speak to emerging social issues, cleanliness, and new safety measures related to transit . ● Shelters: The EXPO Centre Day drop-in saw 534 people over the course of the day with a peak attendance of 303.

Government of Canada ● The federal government today released its essential services list . The list is composed of 10 sectors essential to the “health, safety, security or economic well-being of Canadians and the effective functioning of government.” ○ Energy and Utilities ○ Information and Communication Technologies ○ Finance ○ Health ○ Food ○ Water ○ Transportation ○ Safety ○ Government ○ Manufacturing ● The list of essential services and functions was developed in consultation with industry and labour representatives and provinces and territories. The essential services lists from municipal, provincial, territorial, and Indigenous governments prevail over the federal list. If at any point the federal government enacts the Emergencies Act , this federal list would take precedence. Government of Alberta ● Nine non-profits across Alberta will receive $3 million to provide additional food assistance for vulnerable K-12 students and families in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding is in addition to $15.5 million for the school nutrition program. ○ School boards are encouraged to find innovative ways to provide meals or food to students while in-school classes are cancelled. ○ Edmonton organizations receiving this funding are: e4c - $375,000; Hope Mission – $375,000. ● Government is directing Alberta Health Services to temporarily suspend parking fees at hospitals for health-care workers and the general public during the ongoing COVID-19 For questions, please contact: Yetunde Oke, Intergovernmental Affairs, 1 s.17(1) pandemic. This temporary measure will mean an estimated loss of parking revenue of $7.6 million a month. Alberta joins British Columbia in announcing this decision. Other jurisdictions across the country are expected to follow shortly. Other Big Cities City Watch - online tracking tool on how 48 Canadian cities are responding to the COVID-19 crisis; managed by the Canadian Urban Institute. Vancouver ● The City of Vancouver has launched Give a Hand Vancouver , an initiative dedicated to accepting community offers from businesses and organizations in support of continued efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. ● Give a Hand Vancouver will ensure that all offers - ie. large-quantity materials and services such as medical supplies, cleaning products or food - are being received through one central source, better equipping the City to receive and deploy resources and services. ● The program takes its name from Vancouver’s nightly 7 pm cheer for healthcare professionals and frontline workers. Halifax ● The 2020/2021 Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) budget was largely completed and scheduled to come to Council for final approval in mid-March. However, in light of the economic impact of the pandemic, staff are undertaking a review of the budget to respond to new realities and the Municipality’s projected reduction of revenue for the coming year. Economic impact assessments are currently underway, and there is a tentative plan for a revised budget to come back to Council in late May. Items such as vacancy management and program extensions will be targeted for review during this process. ● Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) is engaging in ongoing discussions with the Province on infrastructure spending and possible stimulus. Staff currently assessing what capital projects can go forward, and what might be deferred. ● Halifax Transit has been designated by the Province as an essential service under the current provincial state of emergency. The five-person social gathering limit and two-metre social distancing limit does not apply to Halifax Transit as stated in the provincial order. ● Following the Province, all municipal parks are closed, as well as beaches, playgrounds, sports fields, courts and associated parking. Those who park in a parking lot that is part of a provincial or municipal park are breaching this order, and will be subject to charges under the emergency provisions and may be towed. 2 The health and safety of City of Edmonton staff and Edmontonians is our top priority. We recognize the importance of having a safe, efficient transit system to provide mobility for essential workers and essential trips, while also ensuring our city’s most vulnerable people get the social support they need. Dedicated working group We struck a working group of experts from both the City and our social services partner agencies to address safety and security challenges stemming from vulnerable populations using transit . They meet daily to discuss, and respond to, any emerging challenges. Immediate actions include : ● Adding train and bus security patrols at key locations, including the redeployment of up to 30 security guards from Commonwealth. ● Working with Neighbourhood Empowerment Team or NET (a partnership of the City, Edmonton Police Service, The Family Centre and United Way of Alberta Capital Region) and REACH to complete a scan of non-destination riders and their specific needs. ● Redeploying some laid off City staff to provide additional transit cleaning services at end of line stations. Additional immediate transit actions we are taking include: ● Adding extra service to address remaining overcrowding issues, where possible. ● Removing brochures from all buses to prevent the spread of germs. ● Encouraging customers to stay home, only make essential trips, travel off-peak, and practice physical distancing. ● E mployees are permitted to use their own face mask. In working with our Occupational Health and Safety partners, we have completed a COVID-19 hazard assessment. Because of the controls we’ve already put in place, we have been advised that face masks and gloves are not required at this time. Safety measures already implemented With an unpredictable situation related to the COVID-19 outbreak, we had to respond quickly to the situation and have implemented a few different measures to enhance safety for ETS Operators and customers. ● We have enhanced our transit cleaning and disinfecting activities in both intensity and frequency. This includes cleaning and disinfecting for buses, LRT, DATS vehicles, transit centres, LRT stations as well as high touch areas in individual and shared workspaces. As part of standard daily cleaning practices, ETS regularly cleans and then disinfects buses and trains to help maintain a safe environment for staff and customers. This involves disinfecting handles, buttons, stanchions, floors, and other commonly-touched surfaces. We’ve also added a new disinfecting agent applied with an electrostatic sprayer that is used daily on all ETS vehicles coming out of service, LRT stations and transit centres. ● Moving to Reduced Service (enhanced Saturday service on weekdays, regular Saturday service on Saturdays and Sundays) ensures we have enough healthy staff available to provide service across the city for a sustained period of time. The reduced schedule also allows for more frequent and thorough cleaning and disinfection of transit vehicles. In addition, ETS has swapped the 30’ buses on community routes with 40’ buses. These larger buses support physical distancing for operators and customers, and they also have driver shields as an additional safety measure. These adjustments have allowed for all buses on the road to have driver shields , when possible. Thereby protecting drivers through a physical barrier and greater physical distancing. ● ETS has adjusted Bus Route 747 . To protect our Operators and the public, we will no longer provide service to and from the airport for travellers. The route remains operational as a charter service for people who work at the airport. Peace Officers will continue to regularly patrol transit property and vehicles to ensure safety and security. ● Suspending fares adds another layer of protection for our conventional and DATS operators as it eliminates the need for cash and transfer handling, thereby minimizing contact with others and increasing social distancing measures. ● For the health and safety of our Operators, and to keep our service reliably running during the uncertain weeks ahead, customers are asked to board and exit using the back doors only . Customers requiring the use of ramp deployment or kneeling of the bus are still allowed to board or alight at the front of the bus. ● The shuttle buses going to the EXPO centre have been outfitted with sealed, double-plastic, vapour barrier near the front of the bus to provide full protection for Operators. Operators are sealed in, and also have a safety shield as well. These precautions have been approved by health officials at the EXPO centre. Operators have no exposure to individuals on the bus. The vapour barrier is regularly inspected to ensure the seal remains intact. ● All DATS vehicles go through rigorous cleaning and disinfecting protocols on a daily basis and operational controls are in place to ensure every driver coming on shift is using a clean bus. Custodial staff are also doing daily cleaning and disinfecting of Percy Wickman garage, including using the electrostatic sprayer. Our service planning has also adapted to ensure proper physical distancing between DATS riders. ● We are offering free and confidential mental health counselling services to all employees and their families through Homewood Health, the City’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provider. Communicating to staff Safety measures for Operators and customers are communicated to ETS staff through posters put up in the garages, digital slides, MDT messages, operational notices and Branch Manager’s updates, sent by email and posted on bulletin boards in the garages.

Vancouver Announced a furlough plan for all of the City’s Exempt staff effective immediately. Affected staff will move to a nine-day pay period until further notice, which amounts to one mandatory day of unpaid leave every two weeks (roughly a 10% salary cut). This is expected to save $7-$9 million which goes part way to covering the City’s expected financial gap. This is being done in addition to the temporary lay-offs to unionized staff (~1500 so far). Montreal Montréal has announced the launch and enhancement of the Government of Québec's emergency assistance program for small businesses in the city.

City Council’s recent amendment to the Public Spaces Bylaw to include communicating acts of harassment based on race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity to include forms of non-verbal communication such as gestures or symbols provides Administation with increased ability to respond to hate and build an Edmonton for all. As the Branch responsible for enforcement of the Bylaw, Community Standards and Neighbourhoods engaged the internal Data Science and Research team (within the Service Innovation and Performance Branch) for technology and innovation support to assist with our response. A partnership with the Anti-Defamation League, a leading anti-hate organization that was founded in 1913, has also been leveraged to support this effort. The Results The partnership has resulted in “Lighthouse”; a project aiming to fight against hate by using technology to track the proliferation of hate symbols. Lighthouse comprises a phone application for data collection and a web application for image labeling and analysis. The phone application allows frontline workers to photograph and upload images of potential hate symbols that are encountered. Images are stored securely, along with time and geolocation. An associated web application allows for i) reviewing and labeling of images using the categorizations provided by the Anti-Defamation League hate symbol database and ii) a dashboard that shows spatial and temporal patterns in the labeled images. In addition to the hate symbols database, the Anti-Defamation League has mentored and supported the development of this technology solution. In return, access to Lighthouse will be provided to the Anti-Defamation League for the organization’s use and with the potential to scale the technology solution to their chapters across the United States. Next Steps A recent presentation with policing and security partners from across Canada has resulted in additional requests for collaboration and expansion — examples include: ● Province of Alberta’s Intelligence Bureau (OIC Hate Crime Coordination Unit) ● Royal Canadian Mounted Police (St. Albert) ● City of Kitchener, Corporate Security ● Lethbridge Police Service ● City of Brampton, Security Operations Community Standards and Neighbourhoods will be testing Lighthouse over the summer. Frontline feedback will then be incorporated and the use of Lighthouse will be expanded to partners to take the fight against hate symbols to the national stage. I wanted to ensure your awareness of how our teams here at the City are innovating and leading the way in this challenging space. If you have any comments or questions about Lighthouse, please contact david.jonescsn@edmonton.ca or kimberley.matheson@edmonton.ca .

For immigrants and refugees, the barriers to full inclusion in the community are often significant and tend to be complex, intersectional and almost always systemic. In 2020, an independent review of the program was completed in order to better meet the needs of the community and address City outcomes. Administration responded to the recommendations from this review and are pleased to share that the EIRC Grant Program was recently launched during the second week of June 2022. Grant applications are open through the calendar year, with $304,000 available until funds are exhausted. Objectives of the grant program: ● Promote meaningful opportunities for ethnocultural immigrant/refugee community groups and organizations to develop and implement projects that address their community-identified needs and opportunities. ● Engage community members, building upon existing cultural wealth, to enhance social inclusion, foster connections and support communities. ● Develop relationships between the City and other communities through collaborations to increase immigrant/refugee participation in community and/or civic life (political, economic, social and cultural) in Edmonton. ● Create a positive community impact that may influence social and/or system change. ● Identify systemic gaps and barriers to participation. ● Support the growth and development of community groups and organizations so that they are better able to respond to their communities' needs. ● Link and bridge community groups to established service organizations for assistance when more complex social service needs, which cannot be addressed by community-based organizations, arise. Updates and overview of the EIRC Grant Program include: ● An increased emphasis on community development within ethnocultural communities. ● Improvements to the application and reporting processes. ● A reset of the funding opportunities to follow a developmental path: ○ Seed grants (Up to $2,000), community impact ($2,001 up to $5,000), and community special project grants (from $5,001 to $25,000). ○ These new grant streams are in addition to the ongoing Space Rental Subsidy Grant. ● The provision of support for any Edmonton-based immigrant or refugee “grassroots” organizations through a newly established Ethnocultural Capacity Building Collaborative, in partnership with the Edmonton Chamber of Voluntary Organizations. The Collaborative intends to offer support in areas such as: ○ Governance and volunteer leadership development ○ Financial management and grant applications ○ Program planning, implementation and evaluation ○ Strategic planning ○ Fiscal agent support, and more As a city, we must recognize the varied skills and assets that immigrants bring to Edmonton—such as education, experience of resilience and unique world views that add to our local knowledge base and spur innovation. Information on EIRC Grants will be shared through the City’s channels and networks to ensure community organizations who may be interested in grants and funding are kept up-to-date. Any interested applicants are encouraged to visit edmonton.ca/newcomersgrants for information on grant program eligibility and to begin the application process.

A second Safety Codes Order was issued to the owner of the adjacent construction site on April 16, 2020 to address the excavation instability issues and remedy damages to the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building. The apartments in the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building had two tenants and both have vacated the building and are temporarily rehoused. In addition to impacting the two displaced tenants, the order may impact the building owner’s ability to re-open their beauty salon when COVID-19 mandatory business closure orders are lifted. The salon owner has expressed that the loss of the tenants and not being able to open the salon when public health measures are lifted could impact their long term financial viability. As a result, public and media attention is anticipated. City of Edmonton Position: The City of Edmonton will work with the owner of the construction site and the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre and apartment building owner to guide them in the necessary measures to meet requirements as outlined in the Safety Codes Orders. The City worked with the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building owner to ensure both apartment tenants vacated the building safely and were able to find temporary housing.

Approach : The Safety Codes Order to vacate the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre and apartment building was issued directly to the salon and apartment owner. The Order to address the excavation instability issues and remedy damage to the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building was issued directly to the owner of the adjacent construction site. A City Safety Codes Officer will monitor the construction site to ensure the owner takes the necessary steps to address the excavation issues and remediate damage to the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building, as identified in the Order. Associated costs for the remediation of the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building are to be established between the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building owner and the owner of the adjacent construction site. The public and media will not be advised and the Safety Codes Orders will not proactively be made public by the City. The City of Edmonton will provide interviews with an Administration spokesperson upon request should the issue become public. Background: On September 3,","ptember 3, 2019, a permit to construct footings and foundation was issued for the site adjacent to the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building. The full permit to construct a mixed use building was issued on February 7, 2020.

However, ultimately the onus is on the owner and their contractors to ensure their Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing construction sites are safe and what is being constructed aligns with affiliated code regulations. The Alberta Building Code requires owners and their contractors to ensure that construction site excavations are adequately secured and that public right of ways and buildings on adjacent property are protected. Additional excavation criteria is found within the Provincial Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Act. Provincial OHS authorities have been notified and Administration understands they were on site as of April 15, 2020. The City had received an inquiry from the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building owner about the activity at the adjacent construction site prior to the Safety Codes Orders being issued on April 15, 2020 (vacate order) and April 16, 2020 (remediation order) respectively. A Safety Codes Officer visited the site to review the inquiry the same day it was received. At that time, the contractor for the construction site next to the Mei & Mei Beauty Centre building was taking measures to manage the excavation as identified in the required geotechnical report submitted to the City when the building permit plans were approved. The construction site owner had not yet requested inspections for the footings and foundation work as the work was not yet complete.

Government of Canada ● The Prime Minister announced long awaited support for the energy sector which has been hit by both the pandemic and the drastic drop in global oil prices. The measures are intended to help retain and create a","nded to help retain and create approximately 10,000 well-paying jobs in the energy sector. The measures to support Canadians working in this sector will: ○ provide up to $1.72 billion, including funding to the governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, and the Alberta Orphan Well Association, to clean up orphan and/or inactive oil and gas wells – creating thousands of jobs and having lasting environmental benefits. ○ provide up to $750 million to create a new proposed Emissions Reduction Fund to reduce emissions in Canada’s oil and gas sector, with a focus on methane. This fund will provide primarily repayable contributions to conventional and offshore oil and gas firms to support their investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Of this amount, $75 million will be allocated to the offshore sector. ○ expand eligibility for the new Business Credit Availability Program announced on March 13, 2020, to help Canadian businesses get the financing they need during this period of uncertainty. The support will be available to medium-sized businesses with larger financing needs, beginning with companies in Canada’s energy sector , to help them maintain operations and keep their employees on the job. ● Additional measures announced today are as follows: ○ $500 million to establish a COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Cultural, Heritage and Sport Organizations to help address the financial needs of affected organizations within these sectors so they can continue to support artists and athletes. This measure is consistent with the government’s other existing COVID-19 support measures for wages and fixed costs for organizations. ○ $675 million to give financing support to small and medium-sized businesses that are unable to access the government’s existing COVID-19 support measures, through Canada’s Regional Development Agencies. For questions, please contact: Yetunde Oke, Intergovernmental Affairs, 1 s.17(1) ○ $287 million to support rural businesses and communities, including by providing them with much-needed access to capital through the Community Futures Network. ○ $250 million to assist innovative, early-stage companies that are unable to access existing COVID-19 business support, through the National Research Council of Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program. ● The Prime Minister also announced that to date $7.5 million payments have been made by the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Government of Alberta ● Premier Kenney's statement on the federal stimulus package for energy sector announced today: ○ We thank the federal government for taking this important first step to support the folks who work in our energy sector. ○ This funding will immediately save or create thousands of jobs, keeping energy service companies going during these devastating times. It will also help us bring oil and gas well sites back to their original condition, leaving a cleaner environment for future generations. ○ More support is needed to deal with the crisis in Canada’s energy sector, but this is a great first step. We will continue to work with the federal government to ensure that the energy sector now gets the support it needs as it faces its own threats from both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Saudi-Russia price war. ● Today, the Minister of Municipal Affairs issued two new Ministerial Orders to amend a previous Ministerial Order (MSD 022/20) dated March 25, 2020, which extended some timelines within the Municipal Government Act and created some unintended consequences with development permit approvals. The City of Edmonton along with other municipalities and industry stakeholders advocated for this amendment, which would revert the timelines back to historic norms and allow approvals to proceed. The new Ministerial Orders also include changes to clarify and shorten some of the timeline extensions in the previous Ministerial Order and they seem to address other areas of concern for the City (pending legal analysis by City Administration). ● Alberta Parks is suspending and refunding camping reservations up to and including May 19. The decision is in line with other jurisdictions, such as Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Parks Canada, which have also suspended or delayed camping reservations. The suspension is in place until the province’s chief medical officer of health is confident the health and public safety risk from COVID-19 is reduced. 2 Other Big Cities City Watch - online tracking tool on how 48 Canadian cities are responding to the COVID-19 crisis; managed by the Canadian Urban Institute.

Moving forward we will provide weekly updates. While calls to support services have not increased over this period last year, EPS reports domestic violence incidents are up. Many support services have interpreted the trend in the number of incidents as being correlated to physical distancing; it is not safe for people experiencing violence to reach out for support given they are likely in close proximity to the abuser which heightens their risk for further abuse. Most Edmonton women’s shelters have space and are open to accept clients.

The last LRT departures start at 10 p.m. while the five Late Night Owl bus service routes will end their trips after midnight. All other service remains the same (Saturday service). Over 40 of the approximately 123 routes offered on a Saturday service schedule provide late night service (after 10 p.m. to end of service, approximately 3 a.m.) Prior to making these service changes, ETS extensively monitored late night routes over several nights and determined nearly 95 percent of passengers were non-destination riders. Therefore, in order to ensure Operator and rider safety, as well as assisting non-destination riders in connecting to appropriate supports, service changes were implemented. Over the April 18/19 weekend, the City worked collaboratively with Alberta Health Services (AHS) to communicate the service adjustments to healthcare employees and to establish an interim process for eligibility and pick-up requests. Currently, AHS is administering taxi chits to healthcare employees. Once a service model is established through paratransit, healthcare workers will be able to connect directly with DATS to book a one-way trip between approximately 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. DATS buses and drivers will be dedicated to this service model and the service will be separate from regular DATS service. Eligible and registered AHS staff will be required to pre-book trips through the DATS call centre. Using paratransit buses, up to two passengers will be picked up for a one-way trip from any of the five Edmonton hospitals (Misericordia Community Hospital, Grey Nuns Community Hospital, Royal Alexandra Hospital, University of Alberta Hospital and Stollery Community Hospital) or from their starting destination (such as place of residence). Currently, AHS is administering taxi chits to employees as needed. As of April 21, 2020 they indicated there was not a heavy demand/use for the taxi chits. Concurrently, the City also issued communications (including web, social media, and through a direct letter issued to AHS Communications to communicate out to their staff ) asking people affected by the service adjustments to contact 311 or complete an online form. Between April 17 and April 21, 32 people contacted 311 and nearly 150 responded to the survey indicating they need late night transit. The majority of the 32 calls to 311 (nearly 85 per cent) indicated they work at a hospital or care facility. The other respondents self-identifying as essential workers listed Salvation Army, Walmart Security, 630 CHED, Alberta Blood Services, and Edmonton John Howard Society as their place of work. Data from the nearly 150 survey submissions are still being collected and analyzed. Other service With respect to other late night service, ETS continues to experience non-destination riders on late night bus service. One bus had a few patrons express concerns that the change in late night service was affecting their commute home. Facilities associated with the service changes were locked earlier and to date no complaints or issues have been identified. Security activity was slightly quieter than usual. Cleaning The night of April 20 saw a decrease in needles found in LRT cars and in the stations. None were found on the LRT cars by the three cleaning crews stationed at NAIT, Clareview, and Century Park, in addition, none were found by the cleaning staff in the shop at DL MacDonald. - 1 - Healthcare late night COVID-19 charter update Edmonton Transit Service BRIEFING NOTE For comparison, an average of four needles were found on the cars each day over the last seven days. That being said, our cleaning contractor, BeeClean, did find several needles just outside the LRT stations, indicating needle use did not stop, rather, moved from inside the ETS vehicles and stations to other locations outside. While there is still a significant amount of garbage, clothing, empty bottles, and body fluids left on the trains along with graffiti and other vandalism taking place, the state of the LRT vehicles and stations were reported to be in an overall better condition that in previous days. The interior of the LRT stations were reported to be roughly 70% cleaner by BeeClean. - 2","No",,,

The City’s response will be aligned with and supportive of existing community responses. The extreme weather response was established as City Policy in 2019 to maintain the health and safety of all Edmontonians. In summer months, an extreme weather response will be activated when Environment Canada issues a Heat Warning in the Edmonton area. The warning is usually issued when the temperatures reach 29°C or warmer during the day and 14°C or warmer during the night for two or more consecutive days. During a response to extreme heat in Edmonton, avoiding dehydration is the primary goal. Access to drinking water, along with a cool place for respite, are keys to the extreme weather response. It is also important to remind Edmontonians to watch for symptoms of heat illness. The extreme heat weather response includes: ● Public communications are issued to announce all extreme response activations. Edmontonians are provided with information on how to watch for symptoms of heat illness and what they can do to help if they are concerned about someone in the extreme heat. ● Peace Officers carry water bottles for distribution to vulnerable people that they meet. ● Where space permits, anyone needing a break from the heat is welcome at any open City facility or library. ● Some facilities activated during the Extreme Weather Response do not have enough indoor space to accommodate people inside, but still plan to provide bottled water. ○ The locations of all activated facilities and what service level is provided (indoor space or bottled water only) is posted on the City of Edmonton website and provided in the news release. ● During a 2021 pilot program, five fire hydrants were modified to become temporary water bottle filling stations so that vulnerable Edmontonians could keep hydrated. In 2022, the program was activated the week of June 6 and stations are currently ../2 - 2 - running at 13 locations, with additional locations being considered. The water bottle filling stations will be available 24/7 until the fall. Water bottle-filling stations are located based on the needs of vulnerable people and, when possible, are placed near access to public washrooms. Anyone can fill up their water bottle at the following locations, which are also listed on the City’s website: Downtown ● Central McDougall and Queen Mary Park 109 Ave. and 107 St. ● Kinistinaw Park 102 Ave and 96 St. ● 105 Ave. and 102 St. Boyle Street Community Services ● 96 St. and 104 Ave. Bissell Centre ● Sheriff Robertson 82 Street and 112 Ave. West ● Butler Park ● Callingwood Park South ● McIntyre Park/OS Farmers Market ● Mill Woods Transit Station North/Northeast ● 118 Ave. and 82 Street Parkdale Plaza ● Clareview Transit Station ● 6512-132 Ave. (Mosaic Centre) ● 12340 Fort Road (Niginan Housing Ventures) How Edmontonians Can Help In non-emergency cases, Edmontonians are directed to Call 211 and press 3 for the 24/7 Crisis Diversion team if they are concerned about someone outside in the extreme heat. The Crisis Diversion team can assist with individuals who may be in distress and can provide transportation to social service agencies. In emergency cases, Edmontonians are directed to call 911.

Additional inquiries may be put forward for items which are more apparent in the summer (due to increased pedestrian access in natural spaces) including encampments. I thought it might be helpful to provide you with some background information on the increasing volume and our current capacity. More information on encampments Our goal to prevent encampments is to continue to provide solutions to help Edmontonians secure safe and sustainable housing. For encampment response, we have five park ranger peace officers who have been managing more than 2500 complaints year to date. For context, in 2015, there were a little over 600 complaints. In 2021, that number swelled to over 6,200. To assist your offices as they respond to inquiries, here is some information on our Encampment response . More information on urban wildlife and animal control In 2021, four park ranger peace officers managed over 1,300 inquiries to 311 for coyote sightings. Of those, 49 required a formal investigation for aggression or public safety risks. The remaining complaints required site inspections, education or citizen consultation advising about normal coyote behaviour. The Animal Care and Control Centre (ACCC) accepts approximately 6,000 stray and lost pets per year - approximately 4,000 cats and 2,000 dogs. The largest volume of animals entering the facility is typically between April and October each year. More than 1,400 animals have been admitted and/or seized under the Animal Protection Act since 2019. Animals admitted under the Act require extensive medical care and treatment as they are often in poor medical condition due to abuse, neglect or cruelty. ACCC performs spay and neuter surgeries for animals transferred to rescue for adoption as well as surgeries for injured animals when necessary. In 2021, almost 1500 surgeries were completed and almost 500 surgeries have been completed to date in 2022. Given the volume of calls for service and our capacity, we prioritize. For example, dog attack investigations must and are prioritized over responses to licensing, barking dog complaints or requests for proactive patrols for off-leash pets. In 2021, the section investigated just under 12,000 complaints, with over 2,200 investigations related to the Act or dog attacks; this year to date has been over 6000 complaints with, almost 700 related to the Act or dog attacks with the same staffing resource levels.

Residents can call, submit a request online or through the mobile app for a range of municipal programs and services related to public transit, recreation facilities, parking enforcement and many more topics. 311 works in tandem with all City departments to provide excellent service to Edmontonians and visitors to Edmonton. Every inquiry is logged and tracked, and all calls are recorded for quality, training, and investigation purposes. Using this centralized service allows for appropriate data capture — which helps keep Edmontonians, and our operations teams, safe as we prioritize and respond to requests in the most efficient manner possible. From time to time Councillor offices will receive reports of service concerns from constituents — and with a high volume of anticipated summer service requests, it is likely that some constituents may reach out to you requesting escalation of their requests. 311 is a key channel to help your offices manage reports from your constituents around the services provided. Should an investigation be required to follow up on a reported service concern, 311 can assist in facilitating a resolution when contact information is provided. Should a Councillor or Councillor’s office requ","ice require assistance resolving constituent inquiries, please email 311councilinquiries@edmonton.ca . We continue to be deeply committed to responding to matters as urgently as we can. Please let me know if you have any questions.

The freeway conversion will upgrade Yellowhead Trail to improve the corridor’s operational capacity, safety, and level of service and supporting road network. Program Update — Overview ● Concept planning of the 66 Street overpass is complete. ● Concept planning of Yellowhead Trail between St. Albert Trail and 97 Street, which includes removal of the signalized intersections at 127 Street, 124 Street, 121 Street and 107 Street, is underway and is anticipated to be completed in the spring of 2021. ● Detailed design of Yellowhead Trail between 156 Street and St. Albert Trail and the Fort Road Widening (Yellowhead Trail to 66 Street) projects is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2020. 2020 Construction Progress ● Construction of 123 Avenue (149 Street to 142 Street) roadway improvement project began in May 2020 and was substantially completed in November 2020. ● Construction for Yellowhead Trail East Widening (from 61 Street to the North Saskatchewan River) began in late May 2020 and is expected to continue through to the end of Fall 2021 (with a break over the winter months). In 2020, the focus was on constructing the westbound lanes of Yellowhead Trail and three dry ponds. In 2021, the remaining work will be completed, including the construction of eastbound Yellowhead Trail and improvements at 50 Street and Victoria Trail interchanges. Additional information on each project is provided in Attachment 1. Project planning and design are scheduled to be completed for all segments of the corridor by 2023, with construction anticipated to continue through to the end of 2027. A summary of the anticipated program schedule is provided in Attachment 2. Infrastructure Planning and Design INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES Memorandum December 14, 2020 Reference No: 379929419-001 To: City Council Copy To: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk IIS Branch Managers From: Pascale Ladouceur Branch Manager, Infrastructure Planning and Design Subject: Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion Program — Fall 2020 Update 2 Public Engagement and Communications In the spring of 2020, all planned public engagement events were cancelled as the City implemented measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. Due to the level of uncertainty, the emphasis was placed on communications materials with clear messaging to instill confidence in the overall program and projects. Recognizing the importance of public input, the program team developed several online engagement strategies, with many of them being implemented as part of the online events launched in early fall 2020. Our online engagement sessions were successful as we effectively illustrated the potential network changes of the various projects and enabled the general public to ask questions and provide input to help our team make better-informed decisions. Program engagement activities included online learning sessions, surveys, Engaged Edmonton, and additional content is on the project websites, such as narrated presentations and informative videos. Public support for the freeway conversion continues to be strong. A newsletter updating the public of the Program’s progress has been distributed by email to subscribers and made available through the City’s website. A copy of the newsletter is provided in Attachment 3. Land Acquisition The project considers opportunities to mitigate land requirements and minimize impacts to the adjacent business and residential communities. Land acquisition is being staged and prioritized to align with the planned sequencing of construction. To date, 98 property interests have been initiated, of which 49 interests have been acquired. For the remaining 49 interests, negotiations are underway on 41, with eight on hold pending additional planning considerations. As planning progresses for the segment of Yellowhead Trail from St. Albert Trail to 97 Street project, additional land acquisition requirements will be identified. Budget/Financial The total approved budgets for the projects outlined in this report are funded for the scope defined within capital profiles, Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion: Project Development (CM-99-0060) and Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion: Project Delivery (CM-99-9600). The Program is within budget and on target to meet schedule commitments. In September 2020, the funding agreement with the Government of Albert","of Alberta was finalized. Provincial contribution begins in 2023 and extends to the end of 2027. The timeline aligns closely with the Government of Canada agreement, which started in December 2018 and extends to March 2028. 3 If you have any questions or require clarification relating to any of the information provided, please contact Kris Lima, Director - Yellowhead Trail Portfolio, at Kris.Lima@edmonton.ca or 780-496-8381.

Eng. - Deputy City Manager, City Operations - Jason Meliefste - Acting Deputy City Manager, Integrated Infrastructure Services","Major LRT maintenance & revitalization projects set to begin",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b9kdS0f3RTxrkAlwFzJrZZAkP32QAAtn)","On April 27, 2020, Administration will begin publicly communicating timelines and transit service adjustments related to major upcoming LRT maintenance and revitalization projects. All of this work is branded as TLC for LRT. This campaign originally launched in spring 2019, and will begin again this spring. Since service reductions related to COVID-19 were announced March 16, LRT has seen a significant temporary decline in ridership. During this time, ETS continues to provide safe and accessible adjusted LRT service for frontline workers and those who require transit for essential trips. The City is also advancing maintenance and revitalization projects that are necessary to keep the LRT operating smoothly over the long term and to enhance the overall customer experience. Administration has a robust communications plan to inform transit riders, residents near the LRT tracks and other stakeholders. When possible, these projects are scheduled to minimize passenger and traffic disruptions. To help accomplish this work efficiently and safely, some work will require partial LRT closures, single tracking and station closures. Customers will be encouraged to regularly check for upcoming maintenance and service changes that will be highlighted on ETS social media. Significant projects with impacts to transit passengers are listed below. Platform Repair and Tile Replacement Over several years, crews will be intermittently completing platform renovations across our LRT system. This work will involve replacing platform warning tiles (the rumble strips at the edges of platforms), and demolishing and rebuilding sections of platforms that require renewal prior to the tile replacement. .../2 -2- McKernan/Belgravia Station Closure From May 3 and scheduled to last approximately 8 weeks, weather permitting, McKernan/Belgravia Station will be closed to passengers to conduct platform repair work and warning tile replacement. Trains will continue to pass through the station, but will not stop to pick up or drop off passengers. Riders will need to use South Campus/Fort Edmonton Park or Health Sciences/Jubilee to board or exit the LRT. If necessary, they can also use Bus Routes 4 or 106 to connect between the bus stops at 76 Avenue/114 Street and either Health Sciences/Jubilee or South Campus/Fort Edmonton Park stations. Starting May 4, from 5-9 a.m. daily, northbound Capital/Metro Line trains will run every 5/10 minutes from Century Park as they do today. After 9 a.m. daily, Capital/Metro Line trains will run every 15 minutes. Metro Line trains will only run between Health Sciences/Jubilee and NAIT. We understand this station closure may cause inconvenience for LRT passengers, however, it allows us to complete the work more quickly and safely while minimizing any community impacts of noise with night time work. McKernan/Belgravia also has the lowest number of passenger boardings out of all 18 LRT stations. When scheduling maintenance, we aim to minimize passenger disruptions while maximizing the work that can be completed. Recently, low ridership due to COVID-19 allows us to complete the work more efficiently during the day rather than at night, which reduces the construction schedule. Closing the entire station also allows the City to continue operating enough train cars to allow for proper physical distancing between passengers. If only part of the platform was closed, we would need to operate shorter trains which could impede Alberta Health’s physical distancing guidelines. A partial closure would also present physical distancing challenges for crews. Our top priority is the health and safety of Edmontonians, our staff and our industry partners. Coliseum Station Platform warning tile replacement work will begin at Coliseum during the May long weekend. Details about service adjustments for May 16-18 are below. Any future adjustments will be announced once confirmed. Stadium LRT Station Redevelopment The Stadium LRT Station Redevelopment will address aging infrastructure that has been serving Edmonton for over 40 years. Construction is scheduled to begin in May and anticipated to be completed in 2021. Improvements include an additional platform, new heated shelters, new public washrooms and a new security office. This work will also involve renovating the entire station building, including the roof canopy, and removing the underground concourse. Ultimately, transit passengers will enjoy an improved customer experience, including upgraded","lighting and a more comfortable waiting area. .../3 -3- As part of this work, on the May long weekend (May 16-18), LRT service will be suspended between Clareview and Churchill. Buses will replace LRT between these stations. LRT will continue to run between Century Park and NAIT every 15 minutes. Additional service adjustments are expected in July and August, and will be communicated once confirmed. Health Sciences Station pedestrian crossing safety upgrades In March, crews began upgrading crossings along the LRT system to further enhance safety measures and improve accessibility, functionality and existing infrastructure. The upgrades to the pedestrian crossing at the north end of Health Sciences Station include adding pedestrian gates, as well as replacing/widening the sidewalk to improve accessibility for those in wheelchairs. During three weekends in May (9-10, 16-17 and 23-24), this work will result in 15-minute frequency for Capital/Metro Line trains. On May 9-10 and 23-24, Metro Line trains will only run between NAIT and Grandin stations. The pedestrian crossing and north station entrance to Health Sciences/Jubilee Station will also be closed from June 19-29. Administration will inform passengers and stakeholders of future changes through edmonton.ca/tlcforlrt, ETS social media and signage at stations.

The OHS Awards celebrate and recognize individuals, teams and branches for their outstanding performance and contributions in occupational health, safety and wellness. The 2020 OHS Awards recognize accomplishments achieved in the 2019 calendar year. To ensure that outstanding health, safety and wellness contributions and performance continue to be celebrated this year, given the current and continued protective social distancing measures, health and corporate-wide focus towards COVID-19, an alternative approach for the 2020 recognition is planned which will take place during NAOSH Week (May 3 to 9, 2020). The alternative approach will include virtual promotion and recognition of award winners. The fo rmal ceremony at City Hall has been cancelled. 2021 Awards and Beyond Recognition and appreciation are integral to building a strong corporate culture rooted in our Cultural Commitments. The OHS Awards celebrate occupational health, safety and wellness contributions and actions that demonstrate the SAFE Cultural Commitment and our Leadership Competencies. Therefore, moving forward in 2021 and beyond, a memorable and meaningful opportunity to recognize behaviours supporting the health and safety of our employees is through integration into the existing categories within the Cultural Commitments Awards. In addition to raising the profile of safety and health recognition and appreciation at the Cultural Commitments Awards, integration of these programs will yield financial and resource efficiencies. Similar to the Charles Labatiuk Environmental Awards, the OHS Awards will be discontinued. Regards, ~ Kim Armstrong",,"No",,,

Government of Canada ● Prime Minister and Premiers’ agreement on a framework to support restarting the economy . A series of principles, crite","iples, criteria, and measures (below) will help guide governments to ease restrictions in a coordinated fashion as they work to restore economic activity and address future outbreaks. ○ COVID-19 transmission is controlled ○ Sufficient public health capacity is in place to test, trace, and isolate all cases ○ Expanded health care capacity exists for all patients, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ○ Supports are in place for vulnerable groups/communities and key populations ○ Workplace preventative measures are in place ○ Avoiding risk of importation ○ Communities are supported in managing local disease activity, including in child care, schools, and public transportation ● Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer released the latest modelling data for the country - COVID-19 in Canada: Modelling Update : ○ Canada has several regional epidemics. Cases in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta are driving recent national epidemic growth. ○ Canada’s epidemic growth is slowing. Whereas doubling occurred every 3 days early in the epidemic, the number of cases in Canada is now doubling every 16 days. ● Based on the modelling data, the conclusions of public health officials are: ○ Canada is making progress to slow the spread and bring the epidemic under control. ○ It is critically important that we maintain our current public health measures until we have achieved epidemic control for the first wave. ○ Relaxing controls too quickly could squander our collective efforts to date and put us at risk of future epidemic waves. ● The House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic met by videoconference today and will meet in person tomorrow. This is as per the agreement reached with opposition parties to enable 2-3 discussions per week on this one topic by all parliamentarians. For questions, please contact: Yetunde Oke, Intergovernmental Affairs, 1 s.17(1) Government of Alberta ● The latest COVID-19 modelling data for Alberta was released today. ○ Updated modelling scenarios continue to estimate that Alberta’s outbreak will reach its peak in late May. ○ Edmonton has far fewer reported cases than Calgary: Edmonton zone - 486, Calgary zone - 3,336. See aggregate data for Alberta that is updated daily. ● The Premier announced that Alberta will release its reopening strategy later this week. Other Provinces Ontario A Framework for Re-opening our Province - outlines the principles the government will use for reopening businesses, services and public spaces in Ontario in gradual stages. No actual dates are identified in the Ontario framework. ● Stage 1: open select workplaces, allow some small gatherings. ● Stage 2: open more workplaces and outdoor spaces, allow some larger gatherings. ● Stage 3: further relax the restrictions on public gatherings, open all workplaces responsibly. ● Each stage will last for approximately two-to-four-week periods to allow for close monitoring of any impacts or potential resurgence of cases. Quebec Gradual resumption of activities - in the coming weeks, the reopening of economic activity, approved by public health authorities, will occur in phases in Quebec according to the areas of activity and geographic zones. ● May 4 (May 11 in Montreal) - retail stores with a direct exterior access can resume their activities, as well as businesses in the supply chains of retail stores. ● May 11 - all construction industry worksites can resume their activities; manufacturing companies in all regions of Québec can resume their activities with a reduced workforce. ● May 25 - manufacturing companies throughout Québec will be authorized to resume their operations with no restriction on the number of employees. All employees who can engage in teleworking must continue to do so. ● May 11 (May 19 in Montreal) - educational daycares, preschools and elementary schools will be progressively reopened to students. Secondary schools will remain closed until September 2020.

Following is an update on the progress of the Office of the City Auditor’s self-assessment and the procurement of an independent validator. The Office of the City Auditor must undergo an external assessment at least once every five years in order to stay in conformance with the Institute of Internal Auditors Professional Standard. Our last external assessment was in 2015. In 2020 we are conducting a self-assessment and having it validated by an external (independent) validator. This method is acceptable per the Standards and was approved by the Audit Committee in November of 2019. External Validator Procurement Process : 1. We issued a Request for Quotations for an external assessment – independent validation in February 2020 to 5 potential validators. 2. We required potential validators to be independent of the City of Edmonton and to be qualified in the professional practice of internal auditing and the external assessment process. As well, they needed to be available to conduct the work during a specific time period. 3. We awarded the contract on February 28, 2020 to the potential validator who met our mandatory requirements and had the lowest price. The successful validator is Kingston Ross Pasnak LLP (KRP). The maximum fee is $18,900. Status of Self-Assessment and External Validation : 1. The Office of the City Auditor has completed its self-assessment. 2. KRP is in the process of completing their external validation of our self-assessment. 3. We will provide the final report on the results of our self-assessment and external validation to the Audit Committee at the June 25, 2020 Audit Committee meeting.

The funding was approved pending a business case to Council. The business case was received by Executive Committee in March 2019 (CR_6756 - March 4, 2019) and a funding agreement for up to $600k was approved, with the conditions to be satisfactory to the City Manager. Since March 2019, Administration has been working with The Public to execute this funding agreement and to help them attain the required permits. However, a number of changes to the project have occurred, some of which may be of interest to Council. Current status Through discussions on the funding agreement, Administration has learned that the scope and cost for the project have changed as follows: 1. City funding was intended to cover commercial kitchen equipment and related infrastructure for five kitchens in a facility with ten kitchens. The anticipated cost was $899k for the kitchens (Phase 1). 2. As the proponents have evolved their vision from the original proposal provided to Council, Note that early budget did not include the full Phase 1 build-out costs which the current budget now includes. 3. The facility also now includes additional kitchens and future phases (including retail space, a cidery, and a cafe). The funding agreement that has been prepared requires proof of third party funding sources sufficient to cover the costs of Phase 1 that exceed the City’s commitment of $600k, which the Public is in the process of providing. Once confirmed, the $600k will be released. Of note, The Public has not provided nor is required to provide proof of s.24(1)(a) third party funding for additional phases - this is outside the scope of the City’s commitment to the Project. Next Steps Both parties are committed to finalizing a funding agreement pending proof of third party funding for Phase 1 and to work through remaining development and license related requirements. There are risks associated with the project - both to the project and to the City. While Administration is actively managing any risks to the City through the funding agreement and ongoing communication with the proponent, some risks remain as follows: Aligned with both our commitments in ConnectEdmonton and fresh, Administration is committed to supporting this proposal within the direction provided by Council.

The Committee oversees the management of the City’s investment funds, totalling $3 billion as at December 31, 2019. 2019 Investment Performance Performance of the City’s funds ranged from 2.0% (Money Market Fund) to 16.5% (Pension Fund), depending on each fund’s asset mix. On a four-year basis, investment returns remained strong and, over a longer-term ten-year basis, returns have been even better with all of the City’s funds having outperformed their policy benchmarks. Finally, the City’s largest fund, the Ed Tel Endowment Fund, paid $49 million in dividends to the City in 2019. This was the largest distribution since the fund was established. Current Market Update In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The economic and social impact has resulted in a swift and severe drop in global GDP. Financial markets have reacted to this shock by declining significantly from their highs reached earlier in the year; however, given their forward looking nature, they should begin to rise before the economic downturn ends. While market volatility is expected to continue, the principles and guidelines set out in the Investment Policy will ensure the City's investments continue to be managed at a prudent level of overall risk. The Investment Committee is confident that the funds are appropriately invested to meet their objectives and will continue to monitor and evaluate the City’s investment program and implement changes as necessary.

A news release was also issued with additional details and updates on dog parks and City golf courses. Administration will analyze the current closures, restrictions, service reductions, etc. and assess when to relaunch those activities, while considering: cost, human resources, political sensitivity, service demand, and AHS recovery criteria in the prioritization. ● COVID-19 Dashboard: The City’s Analytics Center of Excellence has created an internal dashboard for COVID-related data. The Task Team and ELT are assessing the dashboard. Communications and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP) office will assess what information may be published publicly. ● Transit: We are continuing to manage and monitor non-destination ridership on buses and trains. Yesterday, 28 people were escorted from Clareview, eight from Mill Woods and 28 used the shuttle to shelters/downtown. A revised deployment model is being activated on Sunday that will reduce the downtown/shelter shuttle hours to 4 p.m. - 11 p.m. This aligns with peak times of non-destination ridership incidents and will reduce officer resource requirements from 14 to 8 officers a day. ● Donation Management Portal : Preliminary work has been done to establish the parameters for an online “Edmonton Gives” donation portal. The purpose of the portal would be to leverage the City’s convening power (platform and outreach potential through edmonton.ca) to guide and inform the public via an easily accessible technology platform/landing page for donations of goods and services. No financial donations would be solicited through the City’s platform. The portal will direct all financial contribution interests to existing COVID response programs/organizations.

A summary of the anticipated program schedule is provided as Attachment 2. 2020 Key Construction Activities Construction of off-corridor improvements will continue with 128 Avenue and 123 Avenue projects. In addition, the first major construction on the main corridor will commence with the widening of Yellowhead Trail from 61 Street to the North Saskatchewan River. In 2020, construction is anticipated to begin in early May and includes the following: 128 Avenue (156 Street to St. Albert Trail) ● road renewal of 149 Street north and south of 128 Avenue, landscaping and streetlight infrastructure improvements 123 Avenue (156 Street to 142 Street) ● rehabilitation of the roadway between 156 Street and 142 Street ● construction of a new sidewalk on the north side of 123 Avenue ● removal of on-street parking to allow for additional lanes ● streetlight infrastructure improvements Yellowhead Trail East Widening (61 Street to the North Saskatchewan River) ● construction of a new lane on Yellowhead Trail in both the eastbound and westbound directions and repaving of existing lanes ● installation of new stormwater management facilities ● construction of new concrete traffic barriers and retaining walls ● improvements to the interchange ramps at 50 Street and Victoria Trail ● streetlight infrastructure improvements Comm","s Communications via public service announcements, social media posts, subscriber emails, road signs and construction bulletins to share the final design and the anticipated construction activities for 123 Avenue and East Widening projects will take place prior to the start of construction. The project team will continue to communicate with stakeholders during construction to help minimize the disruption to commuters, residents and local businesses. Land Acquisition Land acquisition is being staged and prioritized to align with the planned sequencing of construction. Land acquisition is advanced on the basis of fairness and transparency with property owners. All properties required for the 2020 construction season have been acquired. Negotiations are underway for the remaining properties currently identified as being required, with emphasis on those required for the 2021 construction season. As planning progresses for the segment of Yellowhead Trail from St. Albert Trail to 97 Street project, additional land acquisition requirements will be identified. Public Engagement and Communications In 2019, the Yellowhead Trail team engaged with close to 1,550 members of the public and stakeholders. The team reported back to businesses and residents on the input collected and how it was used to inform each project. In 2020, it is anticipated that public and stakeholder engagement activities will be organized to support the following projects: ● Yellowhead Trail from St. Albert Trail to 97 Street ● Yellowhead Trail from 156 Street to St. Albert Trail ● Fort Road Widening (Yellowhead Trail to 66 Street) Community engagement and communications will continue to focus on building awareness and creating opportunities for the public and stakeholders to provide input on the development of project plans and designs. The format of these engagement activities will be adjusted as necessary to ensure alignment with the City’s approach to public engagement during the public health emergency. Budget/Financial The total approved budgets for the projects outlined in this report are funded for the scope defined within capital profiles, Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion: Project Development (CM-99-0060) and Yellowhead Trail Freeway Conversion: Project Delivery (CM-99-9600).

As of April 21, 2020, the Mosquito Control Program has started targeting the aquatic larvae in order to reduce the numbers of mosquitoes before they emerge as biting adults. Pest Management crews are using trucks and backpack sprayers to treat ground and ditch habitats within the city, while contracted vendors are using helicopters to begin treating open field pools. Keeping the number of adult mosquitoes down improves the quality of life for Edmontonians who may be looking to enjoy the outdoors during the spring and summer season. Although mosquitoes can be vectors for a variety of significant viruses worldwide, such as dengue, and Zika, and local species have been vectors for West Nile virus, the World Health Organization indicates that there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through mosquito bites. If you have questions about the mosquito program, please contact Mr. Mike Jenkins at 780-918-7731, or at mike.jenkins@edmonton.ca .

This Daily Update will include related information as we slowly return to the new normal for operations and begin the transition and planning for relaunching City services and our economic recovery. ● EOC Update: On Friday, Deputy Chief Squire participated in the meeting with the Provincial Operations Centre, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health, Marcia Johnson, and the emergency managers of the 9 large municipalities in Alberta. Much of the discussion surrounded specifics of the Government of Alberta relaunch strategy as well as the opening of outdoor recreation facilities (golf courses) as well as requesting clarification on recommendations or requirements for public use of non-medical masks. ● EXPO Centre: The Task Team is preparing a plan to address concerns associated with social disorder in and around the EXPO Centre. The plan will be actioned as soon as possible and presented to the Emergency Advisory Committee on Thursday. ● Transit: We are continuing to manage/monitor non-destination ridership on buses/trains. A revised deployment model was activated on Sunday that reduces the shuttle hours to 4 p.m. - 11 p.m. and reduces resource requirements. On Sunday 12 people were assisted from Clareview station and 23 were assisted at Century Park. Twenty-six people used the downtown/shelter shuttle. DATS service for healthcare professionals continues. There have been 83 applicants and 53 people successfully registered. Twenty-one hospital trips are booked for this evening. ● Dog Parks: The City’s 38 larger off-leash dog parks were again approved for off-leash use starting last Saturday. The parks saw limited attendance and good compliance with social distancing of owners. As a result, we will begin opening the largest fenced off-leash dog park in Lauderdale by mid week. The remaining Paisley, Alex Decoteau and Manning Village off-leash parks will remain closed for now as the smaller parks provide less room for physical distancing.

Edmonton Transit Service - Number of Buses on the Road and Daily Operating Hours To continue delivering on our safety commitments and enhanced cleaning practices, we have adjusted LRT and bus service. Transit service runs from 6 am. to approximately 1:30 am. There are 431 buses on the road at the peak of service. The last train departures are at approximately 10 pm. Trains go out of service when they reach the end of line, around 10:45 pm. Late Night Owl bus service on 5 routes ends after midnight. Over 40 bus routes still provide late night service with the last bus running until approximately 1:30 am. The Use of Buses as a Daytime Shelter Administration has been working closely behind the scenes to help find ways to keep vulnerable Edmontonians safe and supported during these challenging times. We are also mindful of keeping the health and safety of our passengers, operators and frontline staff top of mind. As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, so too will our response. To help keep everyone safe and to support physical distancing, ETS has introduced many additional safety measures including: ● Adding train and bus security patrols at key locations, including terminus LRT stations. ● Working with community and social partners to complete a scan of non-destination riders and their specific needs. ● Redeploying temporarily laid off staff to provide additional transit cleaning services. ● Operators can access resources if they observe any “sleeping patron” or passenger riding without a destination, and when a bus reaches approximately half capacity. ● Adding sharps containers for needles at key LRT stations. ● Hazard assessment controls are in place (buses with operator shields, rear door boarding, vapour barriers for EXPO buses). ● Administration continues to encourage Edmontonians to only use transit for essential trips, travel off-peak if possible, and practice physical distancing. Standard Expenses for Edmonton Transit Service Standard expenses for all transit (bus, LRT and DATS) is on average $28.5M per month. This does not factor in revenue, recent service adjustments or the temporary staffing adjustments announced. Standard Annual Cost of Maintaining Bike Lanes The cost for snow and ice control, anti-icing and spring sweep of bike lanes, as well as bike lane flower planters (provision, watering and care) is approximately $577,000 annually. There are additional, incremental costs associated with maintaining the asphalt surface and signage for bike lanes that are not broken out of regular costs for those items on roadways. A report to the Community and Public Services Committee on the cost of clearing bike lanes in the winter is anticipated to be presented to Council mid-June. Further Questions Regarding Transit Service or Bike Lanes Further questions regarding transit service may be directed to Eddie Robar, Branch Manager, Edmonton Transit Service. Further questions regarding the maintenance of bike lanes may be directed to Brian Simpson, Branch Manager, Parks and Roads Services.

Since the October 22/23, 2019 City Council meeting, Administration has completed detailed financial and technical analysis to determine an optimal building site location. Based on this analysis, Administration has determined that the proposed Evansdale surplus site location (Attachment 1) has lower development costs and requires less new servicing infrastructure over the original surplus school site presented to Executive Committee in 2016. Once the pause in public engagement activities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been lifted, Administration will engage the community to solicit feedback on the proposed surplus site. Following the public engagement, Administration will begin the process to subdivide the proposed location. Part of the subdivision conditions will include the removal of the reserve designation, which must occur prior to the sale of the land and will be scheduled for an upcoming City Council Public Hearing. The original surplus site location will remain a part of the open space, will not be developed and will be redesignated as municipal reserve upon registration of the subdivision. Following the City Council Public Hearing, Administration will list the property in a public offering. Once submissions for the parcel are received and reviewed, Administration will return to Executive Committee for approval of the sale agreement, or to report on the result, as appropriate.

The primary focus of the webpage will be to profile the needs of community organizations that are already providing pathways to multiple organizations that require monetary and physical donations to support their emergent priorities. The portal will be unveiled at Thursday’s Emergency Advisory Committee meeting. ● EXPO Centre: We have activated a new approach to address social disorder around the EXPO Centre. It includes: Edmonton Police Service (EPS) and Neighbourhood Empowerment Teams (NET) working together to provide additional support in and around the local community and Borden Park; additional Porta Potties supervised by attendants; Transit Peace Officers/LRT/EPS working together to provide additional support to address social disorder concerns in/around Coliseum LRT Station; Capital City Clean Up has met with BIAs and community groups to identify concerns and provide litter kits while City cleaning crews target affected areas; additional shuttle bus service will be provided at the daytime drop-in centre at the EXPO Centre site to transport people to Kinsmen for night time shelter. Details will be provided at Thursday’s Emergency Advisory Committee meeting. ● Picnic Tables: The City will not allow picnic site bookings until after May 31.

I discussed the City’s five-point plan that was shared in last night’s Daily Update.

Across Canada, unemployment reached 13.0 per cent -- the second-highest level recorded. More than one third of the potential labour force (combining: those who were unemployed; those who were not in the labour force, who wanted a job but did not look for one; and those who were employed but worked less than half of their usual hours) was underutilized in April. By comparison, this indicator was at 11.3 per cent in February. The unemployment rate in the Edmonton census metropolitan area rose t o 10.0 per cent in April from 7.9 per cent in March. This rate means that 80,000 r esidents -- more than the population of Sherwood Park -- were looking for work. The region’s employment declined by 44,700 positions in April 2020 from March. The loss was somewhat counterbalanced by fewer persons (employed and unemployed) actively participating in the labour force. Since February, the region has lost almost 66,000 jobs. The April employment loss is the largest month-over-month decline in levels since comparable data were made available in 2001. Across industries, employment losses were broad, with the bulk of losses in the services-producing sector. City of Edmonton Position: The City recognizes that COVID-19 is having sweeping impacts on people and communities. We are moving from responding to the crisis to planning for relaunch, but economic impact of this magnitude will affect how we relaunch. Key Messages: ● We recognize that behind each one of the statistics is a person who wants to work. ● Today’s numbers show there are significant impacts on families, incomes, and businesses. They show that COVID-19 has had a significant economic impact across sectors, provinces, and countries. Edmonton is not unique. ● There are government programs in place to mitigate these impacts in the short term, and the impacts of those programs are shown in other public reporting. ● The labour force statistics also indicate that the path to relaunch will be challenging, given the breadth and depth of workforce slowdowns. Although the city will be moving to relaunch in May, it will take many months to return to previous job levels. ● We also know that Edmonton has the right economic fundamentals in place, and is positioned well to recover. As a community, we are connected, educated, determined and innovative. We have talents the world will need as we move past this crisis. Approach : Administration will provide written or recorded responses to media if asked. Proactive communications is not proposed. Background: The Alberta unemployment rate in April was 13.4 per cent, with about 300,000 Albertans actively looking for work but not having a job. More tha n 2 mil lion Alberta workers continue to have jobs, although there are fewer hours of work and more temporary leaves. ( Table ) Given the Labour Force Survey’s relatively small sample size in Edmonton, the region’s labour force statistics are three-month, seasonally-adjusted averages. ( Table ). In a workforce that has fallen from 834,000 to around 804,000, about 724,000 people had jobs in April and 80,000 did not. Job losses were generally seen across the board, with more pronounced losses in service sectors, (e.g. accommodation, food, and retail trade).

A total of 63 shuttle buses will conveniently and safely connect residents in select neighbourhoods with a nearby transit hub. These accessible shuttles do not follow fixed routes and only operate upon request. This service will help us recover and grow transit ridership, by connecting more people to our transit network. The On Demand Transit service is set to launch in mid-2021 and will be part of a two-year pilot project. Residents will be able to book a ride directly from their smartphone using an app, a telephone, or a website. A shuttle bus with a professionally trained driver will take customers from designated stops in their neighbourhood to nearby transit hubs. This shared ride service provides safe, quick and efficient trips by using Via’s advanced trip planning software to match multiple passengers headed in the same direction. PWT has been leading the Canadian new mobility market since 2017. With its flourishing On Demand Transit systems operating in Calgary, Cochrane, and Okotoks, PWT has the proven operational expertise and resources to successfully manage On Demand Transit service in Edmonton. This service will operate during peak and off-peak hours in approximately 30 communities and provide service to 18 large seniors residences. These sites, which were selected based on a number of factors, will be provided a flexible connection to the new bus network that is rolling out in mid-2021. Edmonton is one of many municipalities that is choosing on-demand transit options for neighbourhoods where it is a better fit than conventional bus service. This flexible transportation solution will support other ongoing efforts to help Edmontonians access safe, fast, convenient and reliable transit service. On Demand Transit service will add another layer to our integrated transit network, offer another mobility option for Edmontonians, and further modernize public transit. .../2 -2- Due to the evolving nature of the City’s pandemic response, we have waited to announce a start date until we have greater certainty about relaunch recovery. ETS will maintain a number of enhanced safety measures to respond to COVID-19 including an enhanced cleaning protocol and use of a disinfecting agent applied daily with an electrostatic sprayer to all ETS vehicles before they go into service at transit centres and LRT stations.

Without appropriate housing options, individuals often inhabit encampments throughout the river valley and public spaces across the city. Every spring Edmontonians witness the accumulation of abandoned encampments, garbage and debris from the winter months, coupled with an increase in the number of people sleeping outside. The Encampment Response Team addresses encampments on public land in partnership with Homeward Trust, Boyle Street Community Services, Bissell Centre and Edmonton Police Service. This integrated effort prioritizes the closure and clean-up of high risk encampments ensuring the safety and well-being of people and increasing housing outcomes for those sleeping outside. Encampment Response during COVID-19 Pandemic The Encampment Response Team has adapted its approach to align with Alberta Health Services guidelines and Centre for Disease Control recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among individuals who sleep outdoors and the larger community. The following changes have been made to support the encampment response: ● health screening of individuals in encampments ● new health assessment protocols including transportation to the EXPO Isolation Centre for unsheltered individuals showing symptoms ● messaging for unsheltered individuals on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 ● delivery of essential goods ● enforceable physical distancing guidelines for small scale encampments ● coordinated closure/relocation and clean-up of large-scale encampments that cannot adhere to physical distancing and health guidelines or present significant safety risks Between March 16 and April 28, 2020, 124 active encampments were identified and individuals at 96 of those sites were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Since April 27, individuals in more than 20 active encampments have been required to relocate to abide by the health guidelines. Administration expects that changes to the delivery of essential services due to the pandemic, including emergency shelter and drop-in services, will increase the number and size of encampments this year. Increasing housing options is key to maintain safe physical distancing between people while reducing the overall number of people sleeping outside. A good example of this is the bridge housing project at Coliseum Inn. Addressing Abandoned Encampments There are approximately 80 inactive encampments requiring clean up and Administration will continue to address this backlog over the next month. Due to biohazards and discarded needles, encampment cleanup requires staff with appropriate training and skills to minimize risk. Should you have any questions about the City’s approach to homeless encampments, clean up, and the prioritization of responding to concerns about encampments, please contact me at your convenience.

Businesses, places of worship and funeral services are required to identify measures to reduce the risk of COVID transmission and to complete and publicly post a template on site or online. Dr. Hinshaw also clarified questions on the number of people allowed at particular businesses. Restaurant dine-in service is limited to a maximum of 50% of capacity, no more than six people to a table, and two metres’ distance between tables. There may be more than 15 people in a room as long as distancing is maintained and there is no interaction between tables. Owners and managers are responsible for enforcing rules. Places of worship are allowed one-third of typical attendance or 50 people, whichever is smaller.

The 2023-2026 Approach to Problem Properties is centred around four strategic pillars and will create prototypes that may be implemented or piloted in pursuit of the vision of the future for the communities and agencies that deal with these properties. New ideas aligned to the pillars will move through a human-centred design process providing agile, strategic direction. Where We Are Today: The Approach is a living document with implementation and progress already underway. Four prototypes have been completed and one pilot program has been launched. These prototypes provided the basis for several of the recommendations made in the council report, CS00896, Problem Properties Initiative Update, presented on April 19, 2022. A memo sent to Council on June 9, 2022,(Problem Properties Initiative Funding - Follow Up) provided considerable detail on the progress made since that report. Below is a summary of the prototypes and resulting actions: 1. Governance & Decision-Making: A central entity with additional dedicated resources is being created for addressing problem properties with one-time funding of $915,000 for the remainder of 2022. Once established, this centralized entity will be the key liaison for the community and Council regarding problem properties and govern the completion of the remaining prototypes. Recruitment is underway to staff this centralized office and the PPI Program Manager will reside within the Community Standards and Neighbourhoods branch. The program manager will operationalize the long-term approach and begin this work on July 11, 2022, which includes coordinating the efforts of Administration, the Edmonton Police Service, Alberta Health Services and the Government of Alberta. 2. Enhanced Enforcement & Inspections: The Community Property Safety Team (CPST) pilot project, a joint initiative between Edmonton Fire Rescue Services and the Problem Properties Initiative, commenced on April 11, 2022. The CPST utilizes the National Fire Code - Alberta Edition 2019 in conjunction with the Municipal Government Act to order owners to secure vacant properties and uses an escalating enforcement model that effectively secures vacant properties ../2 - 2 - against break-ins, at homeowners’ expense. Since the start of the pilot, 23 orders have been sent out to private property owners. Ten unsecured vacant properties have been secured and a further 10 properties will be secured over the coming weeks. In addition, two properties were demolished after receiving orders and four have submitted applications for demolition permits. This outcome is an expected result of the program. One property is being reinvested in to be rehabilitated. The CPST pilot is scheduled to run until October 2023. 3. Partnerships & Collaboration: Tenants and landlords may not know how to resolve their issues or how to get help if they need it. Based on the completed prototype, the Tenancy Toolkit will provide tenants, landlords and frontline workers with the resources and connections necessary to navigate the complexities of problem properties including explanations of rights, rules and responsibilities. The toolkit project begins in July 2022, with an expected completion date of December 2022 for 2023 implementation. 4. Community Engagement & Communication: To make meaningful progress in addressing problem properties, performance towards intended outcomes is monitored and decisions need to be guided by the data and evidence collected across all partner organizations. A logic model has been developed that defines short, medium and long-term outcomes related to problem properties. Additionally, the Public Safety Analytics Program (PSAP) provides a platform that brings together data from partners to inform resourcing and priority setting while providing reporting that shows the impact of resulting interventions. PSAP is anticipated to be deployed for the team’s use in Q3 2022. Where We Are Going: The Approach sets out the initial steps for the journey ahead, and will be a live and a","nd agile approach where actions are set out annually based on the progress made within each of the strategic pillars. The following are key next steps: ● Prepare unfunded service packages, as directed by Council, for consideration at the 2023-2026 budget deliberations to secure ongoing funding to support the Problem Properties Initiative, specifically for ongoing funding of the Community Property Safety Team (CPST) and enhanced dedicated resources to address problem properties. ● Continue to implement the Approach and follow the human-centred design process to advance pilots, new ideation workshops, the remaining four prototypes, and any others that will best alleviate the challenges of problem properties, including one that explores options for increasing the demolition and/or disposition of problem properties.

We will review how this may impact outdoor long weekend events. ● Public Service Announcement: City of Edmonton approaches the long weekend with optimism and a continued focus on safety. ● Patios, Cafes & Outdoor Retail : Administration has developed simplified standalone guidelines for temporary outdoor retail spaces, patios and cafes. A no-fee application and declaration of compliance will be publicly available online for applicable businesses the afternoon of Tuesday, May 19. A Public Service Announcement and City social media messaging will be shared as soon as the website with detailed information is available. ● Transit: ETS is requiring masks for front-line, public-facing transit employees (including Operators, inspectors, cleaners and maintenance employees) when working in public areas as a response to Alberta Health guidelines released on May 14, 2020. To help protect the health and safety of others, Operators are required to wear a mask if they leave the shielded area on the bus or LRT cab to go into any public area. The use of masks by DATS Operators was previously added in response to AHS guidelines for protecting vulnerable passengers. Wearing non-medical masks or face coverings for transit customers is highly encouraged but not mandatory. Not all front-line employees are required to wear masks, face coverings or respirators and hazard assessments at the City of Edmonton have been reviewed and updated to reflect when a mask, face covering or respirator is required. ● Dog Parks: On May 12 the City announced that effective May 16, the three remaining off-leash dog parks in Paisley, Alex Decoteau and Manning Village will reopen, allowing dogs to be off-leash. Manning Village will remain closed due to maintenance. It is currently under the responsibility of Cameron Communities who is conducting the maintenance. Ownership will eventually be handed over to the City of Edmonton once all development/maintenance criteria have been met. The public will be advised when the park reopens. ● Intergovernmental Update : May 15 GOOD NEWS STORIES LOOKING AHEAD ● Edmonton businesses helping other businesses reopen their doors ● ‘It’s like Christmas morning’: Economy reopens We will be monitoring the following emerging issues associated with COVID-19: ● Monitoring for compliance with new Alberta Health allowances for outdoor gatherings ● Monitoring and enforcing business compliance with new Alberta Health rules RECENT EVENTS May 15, 2020 Government of Alberta announces steps to enable non-profit groups to respond to the pandemic and help those in need.

Deputy City Manager, Integrated Infrastructure Services","Aggregate Recycling Program Wind-down","s.17(1)","Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zDSXCCP6IHB4DY-3UIkE6FG7c7skSRcs)","Office of the Deputy City Manager City Operations Memorandum June 27, 2022 Reference No. 438303249-001 To: City Council From: Gord Cebryk, P. Eng. Deputy City Manager, City Operations Adam Laughlin, P. Eng. Deputy City Manager, Integrated Infrastructure Services Subject: Aggregate Recycling Program Wind-down For the reasons outlined below, the City will be winding down its Aggregate Recycling Program. The City of Edmonton has owned and operated the program for over 40 years. Through this program, the City accepts used concrete and asphalt from City of Edmonton demolition and rehabilitation projects, as well as a product from private contractors. The material is processed and then used in City and private construction projects, such as roadway construction and maintenance. The program is currently part of the non-utility funded lines of business within Waste Services, with Integrated Infrastructure Services being the primary contributor of raw materials and the primary customer of processed material in many of their contracts on City road projects. Although the City has decided to wind down the internal Aggregate Recycling Program, it will continue to lead the industry with the mandate of prioritizing the supply of recycled aggregate in its projects. Since leading the marketplace 40 years ago, a lot has changed in the aggregate marketplace including an increased availability and market competition provided through private suppliers for recycled aggregates across the local Edmonton region. In the City’s engagement with industry, combined with Integrated Infrastructure Services experience, having contractor supply recycled aggregate provides improved efficiency and strong market competition as opposed to being mandated by contract to source materials from the City of Edmonton Recycling Aggregate Program. Further, the mandated requirement can expose the City to liability when quality issues are identified without a clear and direct understanding of the root cause of that deficiency. An additional impact in using City-produced recycled aggregate is that contractors are required to mobilize equipment to the City yard and operate within the available scheduling of the City program. Based on these considerations, the City has begun the process in 2022 to permit contractors to both retain raw products from demolition on City projects to allow them the opportunity to process them for future sourcing for new applications on City projects. …/2 -2- With this change, the City will no longer compete with private businesses in an area of work that falls outside the Waste Utility model. Wind-down activities will include the private sale of current stockpiles over the course of one to two years, as well as the accommodation of approximately impacted staff to other roles in the City of Edmonton.

Appropriate notice requirements have been met and the Office of the City Clerk has reviewed the document. A redacted version will be posted on the City website tomorrow. City staff will be advised later today of the release. In the event you are asked to comment on the Attachment, I invite you to refer to the key messages which Administration will be using: ● The City is committed to openness, and releasing information about our temporary layoffs is part of our accountability to Edmontonians. ● The document confirms that temporary layoffs affected all departments and many different job classifications. ● For planning purposes, the information outlines savings estimates and timelines for return to work. They are not hard targets, as circumstances continue to change. ● These temporary layoffs are having an impact as we carefully move the dial toward relaunching our services, and significantly reducing seasonal hiring will have an impact throughout the summer. A shortfall of 2,500 people in the City’s workforce will have a noticeable impact on services, and we ask for Edmontonians’ continued patience as we work through unprecedented circumstances. The Attachment provides details about information that the City has already made public: namely, that more than 2,500 staff have been notified of temporary layoff, that all departments are affected, and that we continue to work with the federal government and our unions on providing supplementary benefits to our staff. As the numbers were estimates for planning purposes, they may have subsequently changed due to redeployments.

Following the EAC meeting Mayor Don Iveson and Interim City Manager Adam Laughlin held a virtual media availability to answer questions from journalists. A public service announcement was also issued to provide further details of City relaunch/recover efforts including: resuming transit fare collection on buses/LRT/DATS starting June 15, 2020; a phased reintroduction of E-scooters at a date to be determined; and adding more Shared Street locations beginning today. In addition we announced that we will temporarily close four outdoor locations this weekend. Blue Quill and Florence Hallock basketball courts and Castle Downs and McKernan skateparks will be closed from Saturday morning to Sunday evening after numerous complaints from the public and numerous violations observed by City enforcement officers. It was also announced that there will not be City of Edmonton registered summer day camps in 2020 due to additional distancing requirements, uncertainty around demand and financial considerations. ● Patios & Outdoor Retail: In the past week 37 businesses have registered to expand their outdoor footprint. City enforcement teams have inspected 23 patios to date and found that all were in compliance. Those that are open are fully compliant. The rest are planning to be compliant once operational. We are working with owners or operators to help them fully understand Alberta Health and City guidelines to become or remain compliant. ● Animal Care & Control Centre: Additional services started Monday, May 25, with acceptance of stray dogs. The Centre is at approximately 24% of its dog capacity with 11 dogs. ● Capital City Clean Up (CCCU) : Clean up efforts are ramping up throughout the city. Large organized clean ups following Alberta Health guidelines will become more common and should be in full swing by Stage Two of the provincial relaunch strategy. Graffiti is being addressed and needle pick up is underway. Citizens should call 311 with discarded needle reports on public property and 311 will deploy the proper resources. There is a link on the CCCU website about safe needle collection on private land.

The Chief Medical Officer of Health may still issue public health orders not tied to the declaration. Alberta Minister of Health Tyler Shandro spoke at a media availability today regarding an announcement to distribute one package each of four free masks to Albertans via fast food drive through locations. Expanded COVID-19 testing for all Albertans was also announced . ● Sports Guidelines: Today the Government of Alberta released new guidelines for organized outdoor sport, physical activity and recreation. The guidelines apply to non-contact outdoor activities organized by a responsible person/entity where 2-metre physical distancing is possible. Activities that take place outdoors not prohibited by the current public health orders can resume with physical distancing, gathering limits and enhanced protection controls in place. ● City Offices: Employees who work in high-density buildings like Edmonton Tower, Chancery Hall and Century Place will continue their temporary work from home arrangement until the end of August at the earliest. A number of logistical and safety considerations must first be explored before these employees can return to these locations. For those employees who work in other locations, there will be additional safety protocols and guidelines as part of our Relaunch plans over the next few weeks. ● Monitoring & Enforcement: The two skateparks and two basketball courts that have been temporarily closed will be monitored Sat/Sun throughout the day and into the early evening to help ensure compliance.

While this is not new money, the federal government believes early delivery of the full funding for 2020-21 will help communities quickly move forward with infrastructure projects and help restart local economies. ● Edmonton COVID-19 Cases: Between Friday and today Edmonton has seen a rise in COVID-19 cases from 531 to 554. Alberta Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said that Alberta Health is monitoring an active increase in the Edmonton Zone and that a number of these cases can be traced back to two private family gatherings. ● Encampments: Media outlets ( Sun / Journal ) recently covered the removal of an encampment for persons experiencing homlessness near the Quasar Bottle Depot at 105 Avenue and 96 Street. Today CBC AM spoke with Hani Quan, the City's manager of housing policy and partnerships about the reasons behind the removal. ● Monitoring & Enforcement: Compliance at the two skateparks and two basketball courts temporarily closed over the weekend was generally good with a few exceptions. Castle Downs Skatepark saw 25 patrols with 15 warnings for people being in a closed area. 10 of those people were found in the skatepark at a time with all of the caution tape taken down.

Yesterday, Edmonton Public Library staff attended the town hall for libraries. A provincial guideline for library reopenings is expected in the coming weeks. City Administration took part in sessions today regarding personal service shops, movie theaters and live theaters and tomorrow will attend sessions on gyms, fitness studios, arenas and sports fields. The town halls provide an opportunity for input and an understanding of impacts to City programs and services. A Public Service Announcement was issued today to remind Edmontonians that parking fees in EPark zones and City-owned parkades will be reinstated Monday, June 8. To promote parking availability during relaunch and recovery phases, the City will be reducing hourly parking rates in approximately 80% of EPark zones. Tomorrow we will provide an update on the relaunch/recover strategy at the Emergency Advisory Committee meeting along with a recommendation on the State of Local Emergency declaration. ● Masks: ETS is in discussions with Alberta Health regarding the distribution of 500,000 non-medical masks to Edmonton Transit users who may not have vehicles to obtain masks through the provincial drive through program announced last week. ● Monitoring & Compliance: Monitoring of previously closed skateparks/ basketball courts is showing good compliance with Alberta Health guidelines. McKernan skatepark saw 2 patrols with no warnings/tickets; Castle Downs skatepark saw one patrol with 20 users encountered but no warnings/tickets; Blue Quill basketball courts saw 2 patrols with no warnings/tickets; Florence Hallock basketball courts saw one patrol with 15 people encountered but no warnings/tickets. ● Demonstrations: A large Equality for All anti-racism demonstration is being planned via social media and takes place this Friday evening at the Alberta Legislature.

Information about the strategy was released here , and on YouTube . In short, indoor recreation centres, libraries, fitness centres, sports, gyms, pools and arenas are allowed to open with restrictions. As well, larger groups are permitted at indoor and outdoor events, many wellness and personal services (e.g. massage, reflexology, and spas) are allowed to reopen with restrictions, and many sports and arts activities can begin with restrictions. While the province’s state of public emergency declaration ends on June 15, a number of public health orders remain in place. At this point we do not have a lot of answers regarding further specifics of the provincial announcement. Provincial guidance documents are being posted online that we will need time to review. We do know that the relaunch of the businesses and programs highlighted will have a significant impact on our own relaunch strategy. Administration Task Teams will thoroughly review the details of today's announcement and we will assess how limited budgets could be reassigned, what facility adjustments would be required, what services will continue to be delivered in this new economic reality, and what staffing levels would be needed to relaunch some services. We will provide you with an overview of the possible repercussions and options at the next Emergency Advisory Committee meeting on Thursday, June 11. In the event you are approached by media or residents for additional information, below are messages for your consideration. ● The province’s announcement about health requirements set the conditions for how different businesses can move to relaunch. ● This is encouraging news for Edmontonians, their families, and their businesses. ● The province says that we “can” offer a service, and the City must decide whether it “will” do so. ● City revenues have fallen significantly, a large number of employees have been laid off, we are committed to meeting safety requirements, and we must be ready to dial back services if public health conditions change. ● There is much more to consider than the province’s scheduled date. ● We will review the provincial announcement and our own operations, and make decisions about City programs in the weeks and months ahead. ● Where budgets and circumstances allow, we will relaunch City programming. ● We have already determined that some City programs will not be returning this summer, and those decisions stand. Rundle Park golf course, spray parks, outdoor pools and children’s day camps will not be offered this summer. ● We will keep Council and Edmontonians informed as these decisions proceed.

CURRENT ACTIONS (Immediate) 1. That a Notice of Intention to Designate a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1, be served on the owners of the property located at 9759 - 87 Avenue NW in accordance with Section 26 of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9.1 2. That the City Manager be appointed to implement matters arising from the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Designate the Abram Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1. FUTURE ACTIONS (At least 60 days after the Notice of Intention to Designate is served) 1. Pursuant to the provisions of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9, a Bylaw to Designate the Abram Residence as Municipal Historic Resource (the “Bylaw”) will be brought forward to Council for their consideration. 1 On November 26, 2019, City Council passed amendments to the City Administration Bylaw, delegating approval of Notices of Intention to Designate (NOI) under the Historical Resources Act (HRA) to the City Manager, where the owner consents to the designation of their property. The NOI initiates the designation process under the Historical Resources Act ; the final decision on designation remains with City Council by way of a bylaw. 1 2. If approved, the Bylaw and corresponding Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will contemplate funding of up to $74,790.93 to be provided from the Heritage Resources Reserve to fund City-funded work on the Abram Residence, as described in Attachment 5. BACKGROUND The Abram Residence is on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton, and merits designation under City Policy C450B - Policy to Encourage the Designation and Rehabilitation of Municipal Historic Resources in Edmonton. On March 23, 2020, the owners completed the application requirements to have the Abram Residence, located at 9759 - 87 Avenue NW, designated as a Municipal Historic Resource under the provisions of City Policy C450B. If designated, any future renovation of the Abram Residence will be required to meet the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the Heritage Resources Reserve will pay the owner up to $74,790.93 for rehabilitation. The current Reserve balance is sufficient to cover the committed funding, including the Abram Residence. The total estimated cost of the restoration work for the project is $149,581.85. Beyond the $74,790.93 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, the owner is responsible for all costs of the restoration work for the project. The projections for the Reserve (using current commitments) anticipate a Reserve balance of $1,431,279.61 at the end of 2020. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. Based on the current commitments, the Reserve balance is anticipated to decline to a balance of $453,840.68 at the end of 2021. The Reserve is funded by the tax levy on an annual basis ($2.3 million in 2019 including $418,000 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd). PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT Public engagement was not undertaken as part of this process, as it is not required under the Historical Resources Act . 2 RT c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Bonnie Andriachuk, City Solicitor, Law Attachments: 1.

Since Council’s February 19, 2020 motion to participate in this venture, a few updates have been made that reflect the input of the 10 members of the commission and include route changes and revisions to financial figures based on the withdrawal of Strathcona County, Sturgeon County and Leduc County from the Commission. The Regional Transit Services Commission Transition Team has developed an addendum document to the Accelerating Transit in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region: Building a Regional Transit Services Commission final report released on January 22, 2020. The addendum (attached) outlines updated routes and financial figures included in the RTSC business case. These revisions reflect the removal of services previously incorporated to serve Strathcona County, Leduc County and Sturgeon County. Like the original report, the document serves to demonstrate the viability of a Commission in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region based on which municipalities have chosen to participate. Support for the initiative remains strong among the primary partners in the proposed service and the revised business model still demonstrates tangible benefits of consolidating services - both in efficiency and cost. Political support from the participating communities has solidified to a core group of 10 since the original votes by 13 were held in the first quarter of 2020, prior to the pandemic disruptions. In subsequent months, two rural partners have revisited their decision and withdrawn from the initiative: Sturgeon County, who remains supportive of the concept (but currently offers no service to its residents) and Leduc County, which does not support the governance model. Next Steps On June 11, the Transition Team will submit the formal joint application package to the Alberta Minister of Municipal Affairs requesting creation of the Commission. This application package will include the addendum, the original report (as presented in CR_7974), and a preliminary set of bylaws for the new organization. A news release sharing that this milestone has been reached is planned for the same day. While the application is in process with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, background work will continue to advance the initiative and we will respond to any questions that may arise from the Province. Asset Considerations As part of analyzing the financial viability of this initiative, under the scope of the current work, Ernst and Young (EY) has analyzed all transit-related assets by municipality. As part of this review, they reviewed assets for transfer of control or ownership, separated them into common classes, obtained asset costs and depreciated values and validated each municipality's results through one-on-one engagement of the administrations. They have also obtained and aggregated each municipality’s future capital plans related to transit and assessed for transfer of control or ownership, separated into the asset classes and validated these with each municipality. Finally, they have calculated the annual reserves required for existing and future assets and have determined a cost allocation methodology so these can be compared to existing reserve allocations maintained by municipalities. This work has reinforced confidence in the financial viability of the initiative. Needs Support for this complex initiative is critical going forward as we begin an evolution from concept to operations. On behalf of the 10 partners, Administration is in the process of obtaining additional external shared support for the pre-implementation stages required (and that can run concurrently) as the application works its way through the legislative process. Together with EY, we have developed a reasonable, phased work plan in the context of COVID-19. While it is unknown how long the Province’s approval of the application may take, continuing these efforts will allow necessary detailed background work to continue to refine the conceptual work contained in the report. Continuing this work will also allow us to be ready to activate the Commission without delay once the regulation related to officially commencing the Commission is in place.

In conjunction with this, approximately 840 Ride Transit Program participants did not receive their July monthly pass in the mail. City of Edmonton Position: The City will expedite the mailing of July monthly transit passes to the Ride Transit Program participants who do not receive their July pass in the mail. The City will also mail a letter to the Edmontonians who mistakenly received a July pass that asks them to dispose of the pass. Key Messages: ● We are acting quickly to mail July transit passes as soon as possible to the Ride Transit Program participants who did not receive their July pass. We recognize the critical importance of providing transit passes to those who rely on them. ● We will be mailing a letter to Edmontonians who mistakenly received a July transit pass that asks them to dispose of the pass. Passes are not to be transferred or sold (Bylaw No. 8353). We are hopeful Edmontonians who have received the passes in error will destroy them. ● Citizens’ private information was not compromised, and remains safe and confidential. ● We are reviewing how this occurred to ensure it does not happen again. ● We apologize for any inconvenience or confusion caused by this system error. ● The Ride Transit Program is intended to provide greater access to ETS by reducing financial barriers for eligible low-income individuals and families in Edmonton. July transit passes were provided free of charge as part of the City’s relaunch efforts, to further support individuals and families during this uncertain time. Approach: A written statement will be provided if media inquiries are received. Background: As part of the City’s relaunch efforts, it was determined that Ride Transit Program participants, who purchased a monthly pass in 2020, would be mailed a July pass, at no cost. The total number of participants to be mailed was approximately 29,000. The error affected approximately 840 participants in this group. The approximately 840 who received the July transit passes in error were Edmontonians who had previously signed up for a City recreation program. The Ride Transit Program is intended to provide greater access to ETS by reducing financial barriers for eligible low-income individuals and families in Edmonton. Through a partnership with the Government of Alberta, the Ride Transit Program provides Adult and Youth monthly transit passes to eligible low-income Edmontonians at a subsidized rate of $34 or $48.50 per month, depending on household income.

Background The City of Edmonton purchases over $1 billion in construction, goods and services each year. It is obligated to adhere to trade agreements and procurement law. Edmonton uses a competitive procurement process as the preferred method of procuring goods, services, construction and intellectual property. The City is committed to open, fair and transparent procurement processes, which are common practice in government and the private sector. In 2019, 96% of contract spending was awarded through a competitive bidding process. As procurement is competitive, and vendors have already agreed to a service at a given price, it is difficult, practically and reputationally, for the City to reopen agreements part way through their lifespan. That said, the City has set up processes to review existing agreements regularly to assess value and pricing competitiveness, looking for opportunities for savings during renewal or as permitted within the agreements. In regards to the City’s procurement, Council made the following motion in December 2018 during the budget deliberation process: “ That Administration be directed to pursue a vendor management strategy for both operational and capital spends that would target to reduce the overall external services budget for both operating and capital as follows: Year 2019 2020 2021 2022 Proposed % of reduction 4% additional 3% additional 2% additional 1% Vendor Management Strategy Update ../2 - 2 - In 2019, Administration saved $5.8 million through both contract savings and cost avoidance for existing contracts against the target of $8.5 million set by Council. Cost avoidance measures include rebates implemented for certain levels of City spending, and reduction in costs for decreased service levels from those originally contracted or general reductions in contract spending. Administration reallocated these savings to offset increases to the 2020 Operating Budget. The following factors contributed to the City not meeting the $8.5 million target: ● Some suppliers had been contacted by departments prior to 2018 for contract savings through Council’s 2% initiative. Cost savings found in 2018 and 2019 were reallocated to the 2019-2022 approved budget to meet existing needs. As an example, City Operations found $1.79 million in savings that is not included in the $5.8 million total (primarily in cost avoidance against future contract increases) in 2018 and 2019; ● Many contracts were consolidated and procurements were conducted in 2019 (including, but not limited to concrete leveling, custodial services and bus repair parts) that allowed the City to realize better pricing for these goods and services. Some of these savings were not applied to the $8.5 million target as the total savings were not quantified previously to the requested 2% initiative; ● Some suppliers were unwilling to reduce contract pricing due to market challenges. The cost of putting these contracts back out to the market would likely be higher than any savings that might have been possible from a different vendor. Examples of savings in 2019 included: ● City Operations successfully renegotiated its bulk fuel (diesel/gasoline) contract resulting in estimated savings of $2.6 million for the 2019-2022 budget cycle; ● In an inventoried parts contract, the City sourced parts directly from the manufacturer, resulting in 60% savings (approximately $147,000 per year). An additional $1.7 million cost savings was achieved through various sourcing events, day to day purchases and better negotiation of other inventory contracts (renewals, extensions, and new contracts); ● Hourly rates on an operational contract supporting safety codes inspections were negotiated down by 5%, for $150,000 in annual savings without service level reductions; and ● In renewing a contract for office supplies, the City cancelled an annual price index increase of 2.5% within the contract and reduced the overall pricing of materials by 2.9%, generating an overall savings estimated at $90,000 for 2019. In addition to contract savings, Administration is increasing the volume of transactions that are competitively procured. Seeking out competitive procurement methods wherever possible supports the City in getting the best value for money for goods, services and construction. The City has increased the transaction volume of com","ume of competitive procurements from 33% in 2017 to 52% of all transactions in 2019. As noted above, in terms of total dollars, 96% is awarded through a competitive process. As an example, the City recently concluded a procurement and awarded a contract for bus repair parts by consolidating the City’s spend with a single supplier, where four were used in the past. This contract is estimated to save 8-10% over the life of the contract (the total contract value is estimated at $50 million). The City is working on the same approach to other inventory contracts to yield additional savings. - 3 - 2020 strategies for the Vendor Management team include the following to address the 2018 motion: ● Administration proactively reduced the contracted services budget for all City departments by $8.8 million for the 2020 budget year to address financial effects of COVID-19, which will exceed the full cost savings target for 2020 of $6.3 million; ● Continued efforts to reduce contract costs. For example, the Open City and Technology Branch has initiated requests for reductions and, to date achieved approximately $700,000 in reduced costs for good and services; ● Pilot the corporate category management framework developed in 2019 and target additional contract categories where the City can achieve better value for money, and negotiate better pricing through consolidated procurement; ● Deploy an updated Supplier Performance Management Program to better manage supplier performance for current contracts and evaluate a supplier’s prior performance in future competitive procurement opportunities; and ● Work with City contract managers to increase knowledge and awareness of negotiation practices, evaluation planning, and requirements gathering for contract management.

If successful management continues (i.e. daily cleaning, corralling, safety, COVID-19 messaging) they will be able to increase their fleets to 400 e-scooters each on June 15. A third expansion (Bird 900/Lime 1,500) can happen on July 1. Designated corrals (five per vendor) have been set up and can be found by clients through the vendor app. The number of corrals will increase as the fleets increase over the next month. ● Funicular: The funicular and elevator are currently undergoing maintenance and are expected to resume standard operation Monday, June 15. New COVID-19 transmission prevention measures such as additional scheduled cleaning of high touch surfaces during the day and COVID-19 hygiene awareness signage will be added to the facility. ● Transit: Fare collection will resume on June 15 for transit. Masks will be distributed, in partnership with the GoA, the same day as fare resumption. Masks will be distributed between 7am-7pm at West Edmonton Mall Transit Centre, Mill Woods Transit Centre, Northgate Transit Centre, Century Park Transit Centre - on the second floor, Churchill LRT Station, Clareview LRT Station, and Kingsway LRT Station. As weather continues to improve and further relaunch activities take place, ridership is expected to increase. It will be difficult to add extra buses in the short term due to workforce constraints in the Transit Operator pool. ● Cemeteries: As part of Stage 2 relaunch, in-person sales and service are being reintroduced at the Cemetery Sales and Administration offices at Beechmount and South Haven Cemeteries. This will include new controls and measures to help ensure staff and the general public remain safe while providing continuous support and services to all patrons. * COVID-19 AT A GLANCE EDMONTON Total to Date 645 Active 134 New 22 Deaths 13 ALBERTA Total to Date 7,276 Active 371 New 47 Deaths 151 1 Government of Alberta John Hopkins Global Cases WHO Daily Report * Last 24 hrs SHELTER SITE ACTIVITIES EXPO CENTRE ● Isolation shelter: 15 ● Day drop-in: 709 KINSMEN SPORTS CENTRE ● Overnight shelter: 138 CENTRAL LIONS REC CENTRE ● Overnight Shelter: 33 EDMONTON VALLEY ZOO: Today media were invited to book an appointment with Zoo Director Lindsey Galloway for a sneak peek tomorrow at preparations for the reopening of the Edmonton Valley Zoo.

The next update will be provided to Community and Public Services Committee in the fall pending any changes to the calendar in the future. Data from Alberta Health According to Alberta Health’s Alberta Opioid Response Surveillance Report Q4 2019 , released in March 2020, a total of 603 people had died from an apparent accidental opioid poisoning in 2019. By comparison, in the same time period in 2018, there were 769 apparent accidental opioid poisoning deaths. The report also indicated: ● Across Alberta, 109 people died from apparent accidental opioid poisoning related to fentanyl in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 121 people in the previous quarter. ● On average, just under 2 individuals die every day in Alberta as a result of an apparent accidental opioid poisoning. ● In 2019, 80 percent of accidental fentanyl-related deaths listed at least one other substance as contributing to death, the most frequent being methamphetamine (48 percent) and cocaine (29 percent). ● The municipalities of Calgary and Edmonton continue to have the highest number of accidental fentanyl and non-fentanyl related poisoning deaths. Supervised Consumption Services in Edmonton From October 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, there were 16,899 visits to supervised consumption services locations in Edmonton, with 628 unique visits. During the same time period, 128 overdoses were attended to at Edmonton sites. There were no fatal drug poisoning events across all supervised consumption services locations. More than 25,000 referrals have been made at the sites to connect clients with other services. Supervised Consumption Services - Community Liaison Committee According to the Community Liaison Committee’s Terms of Reference, the original term of the committee was March 2018 to February 2020. At the January 2020 meeting, the committee was decided that it would reconvene after the provincial review was released. A ../3 - 2 - virtual committee meeting is scheduled this month. Provincial Review of Supervised Consumption Services The Government of Alberta conducted a review of supervised consumption services in September 2019. The report was released to the public on March 5, 2020. The report concluded that “there are serious problems with supervised consumption and needle distribution services as they are currently being provided in Alberta.” However, the report stated that if the services were “improved and incorporated into a more comprehensive recovery-oriented system of care,” they would be more effective. The report briefly noted Edmonton’s unique situation compared to other jurisdictions; for example, the stakeholder support shown at the two Edmonton town halls and the Edmonton Police Service data showing a decrease in calls for service near the sites, unlike in other jurisdictions. The future of supervised consumption services will be determined on a city-by-city basis. Community Engagement/Response Throughout 2019, Administration took steps to work more closely with communities experiencing high rates of fentanyl deaths. This included hosting community naloxone training and opioid information sessions; developing an in-depth scan of the community to better understand its current demographics, assets, and resources; meeting with Alberta Health Services representatives working in mental health and addictions to discuss ways of working together; and keeping abreast of new resources from Alberta Health Services on substance use that may be disseminated in the community. Administration is also working collaboratively with REACH Edmonton and other community agencies to develop an interactive exhibit with the goal of increasing awareness of, and empathy towards, substance use. The exhibit will present different stories about addiction, developed in partnership with people with lived experience. It is modelled after the Opioids Don’t Discriminate exhibit which Strathcona County presented in 2019. Intermunicipal Response The City of Grande Prairie received funding through the Alberta Community Partnership to lead a project addressing how communities across Alberta can share knowledge and resources, and ultimately to develop an Opioids Response Guide. The Project Team is currently forming a steering committee to move this work forward. Response to Other Substance Use The Edmonton Police Service an","olice Service and Alberta Health Services have provided further information on their responses to other substances given the increasing prevalence of methamphetamine and its associated challenges. New Edmonton Police Service Committee The Edmonton Police Service struck a steering committee on psychoactive substances with membership from a variety of community service organizations and other orders of government and institutions. The goal is to create, test, and monitor new evidence-based interventions to address community safety and well being as it is impacted by psychoactive drug use. - 3 - Alberta Health Services Collaboration on Opioids and Other Substance Use In March 2020, Alberta Health Services completed an 18-month project focused on educating primary care physicians on opioid agonist therapy for patients who misuse opioids. As of December 2019, the outcome data for Edmonton appeared to be positive, with 394 primary care physicians (representing approximately 31 percent of family doctors that belong to the Primary Care Network) trained and actively prescribing the therapy. Alberta Health Services is currently developing a Methamphetamine Action Plan to address the need for a more coordinated response to methamphetamine use issues and to respond to the increased presentation of methamphetamine-related concerns throughout the system. The plan will include information on activities currently taking place, gaps that need to be filled, and recommendations for future work. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Alberta Health Services has developed a harm reduction guidance document for community service providers as well as opioid poisoning response recommendations from the Community Based Naloxone Program.

Those not open expected to reopen very soon. This weekend 541 inspections were conducted with 295 business open, operating and in full compliance and 246 not currently operating. Site inspections included officers acknowledging the ability to open as part of the Stage 2 relaunch, ensuring guidelines were being followed, educating the business on any measures that need improvement, thanking businesses for the measures put in place and any great work being done, handing out materials for that specific business sector from Alberta Health, and answering questions from owners or managers. Overall restaurants appear to be busier with lots of takeout and delivery options available. Table distancing was appropriate and servers were wearing masks/shields. Personal services were very busy. Nail salons were the busiest and all had plexiglass barriers between the client and the nail technician, many customers and employees were wearing masks, hand sanitizer was available at entrances, and masks were being offered upon entry. Gyms/fitness locations mostly remained closed. Wellness services mostly remained closed as well. Some massage studios inspected were open but had no customers. Most businesses had information taped on their doors stating it would take time to get everything se","t up to keep customers safe and that they'd open when able.

This area of Whitemud Creek was chosen as it is the only area on the riverbank where the boat could be pulled out of the water without the need to remove vegetation. With the guidance of the City of Edmonton, the owner produced an environmental screening report which included a plan to mitigate the environmental impacts to parkland and the river. The City contacted local environmental groups to make them aware of this work. Last week concerns were raised that the excavation needed to build the drydock was more extensive than what was agreed to in the permitting process. Specifically, concern was raised that the excavation site appeared larger than what was agreed to. Fisheries and Oceans also noted that not all of the required erosion mitigation measures had been put in place to protect fish spawning habitat. Since that time it has been decided that the boat owner will need to obtain a development permit under a Special Event permit. Besides this new requirement, the City is closely monitoring the project to ensure the owner and the project team on site are following proper environmental practices, and are carefully mitigating their impact on the environment. As well, the project team working on the dry dock have provided erosion control to protect the river. Once the boat is returned to the water, the site will be remediated back to its original condition. As yet, this work, which is very visible from the Whitemud Park walking trails, has not received media attention and only two calls to 311. If you have any concerns or questions about this work, or if you require further information, please contact me.

The policy review and engagement process identified the need for ongoing communication and transparency between the Administration, external stakeholders and members of the public, and the City Procedure recommended the continuation of the IPM Operational Committee and establishment of an Advisory Group. IPM Operational Committee The IPM Operational Committee (Attachment 1) consists of both members of City of Edmonton administration and external partners, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities in the Terms of Reference and an Enviso Manager chairs monthly meetings. City of Edmonton staff directly manage IPM operationally and strategically, representing pest management, urban forestry, recreational facilities, parks and natural areas management. External partners include Alberta Health Services, Health Canada, Alberta Environment and Parks and EPCOR. The purpose of the Committee is to monitor, evaluate and report on the City’s IPM Policy and Procedure C501A and policy implementation. Each member is responsible to their own agency and to the legislative and regulatory frameworks they work under. While the committee as a whole does not have a collective scope of authority, .../2 responsibility for City implementation and policy adherence lies with the business areas and Enviso, the ISO 14001 certified environmental management system. Membership and the Terms of Reference are confirmed annually. IPM Advisory Group City Administration recruited applicants to the IPM Advisory Group in the fall of 2019, and appointed members following interviews in January 2020. The group held its first meeting in February 2020, and continues to meet monthly by teleconference. The group has elected a Chair, and has finalized the Terms of Reference and Conflict of Interest declaration procedure. The defined purpose of the group is to provide a vehicle for the development and flow of strategic advice and expertise to the public and the City of Edmonton to facilitate public perspective. All members of the Advisory Group are self declared as Citizens at Large, and do not directly represent the organizations or employers they currently or historically are affiliated with. The 13 member group represents a rich diversity in IPM experience and interest, from academia, industry and government policy development and management. City Administration directly approached the external partners noted in the IPM Operational Committee membership to request participation in the Advisory Group, and due to their mandates, were not able to participate in the advisory capacity as indicated by the Policy Procedure. However, all offered to attend as guests or provide subject matter information as requested by the Advisory Group. The Advisory Group recognizes that not all voices are represented at the table and is working to ensure the collective wisdom of the community has an opportunity to be heard whether through direct recruitment or invitation to present. The Group is working directly with the City of Edmonton to apply all lenses, including GBA+. All members of the public are welcome and encouraged to discuss issues and concerns with the Advisory Group, and the group will be developing mechanisms for this direct interaction in the coming months. An annual report on integrated pest management activities in 2020 will be shared with Council in early 2021, and will also be made available to the public. cc.

Some of these restrictions include appropriate physical distancing while working out (including both high-intensity and other activities), a maximum of two personnel in the gym at a time, opening windows for ventilation or moving equipment outside if possible, frequent hand hygiene, enhanced cleaning of all equipment and a regularly scheduled cleaning of each facility utilizing the Clorox 360 electrostatic disinfection system. This move has been embraced by EFRS staff who rely on regular exercise to assist with both their physical and mental wellbeing, as well as being in the best condition to perform their job functions at the highest level.

Grant Hunter introduced Bill 22: Red Tape Reduction Implementation Act, 2020 which proposes 14 legislative changes across six different ministries. Bill 22 is a continuation of the provincial government’s Red Tape Reduction Initiative as identified in the UCP government’s election platform. Several of the proposed changes in Bill 22 aim to promote job creation and economic growth by removing unnecessary burdens imposed on Albertans and businesses. Other changes focus on expediting government approvals, enhancing government transparency, eliminating outdated requirements, and reducing the administrative burden on municipalities. Key Highlights of Bill 22 While a majority of the proposed changes do not have a significant or direct impact on the City of Edmonton, the most significant highlights for the City of Edmonton include streamlining the process for establishing Regional Services Commissions, which could impact the proposed Regional Transit Services Commission in the Edmonton metropolitan region and the elimination of Energy Efficiency Alberta. A summary of these changes are outlined below: Regional Service Commissions With the proposed Amendments to the Municipal Government Act (MGA) Part 15.1: ● The process for creating a Regional Services Commission has been changed significantly and the requirement of applying to the province and having an MGA regulation passed has been removed. 2 ● Commissions can now be established via Council resolutions by the member municipalities. If the Bill passes, this change will take effect on September 1, 2020. ○ This significantly alters the process for the City and its regional municipal partners in their preparation for the creation of a Regional Transit Services Commission. ● The new amendments also allow the Minister to exercise a significant amount of control over commissions. ○ For example, there is no limit to the number of directors the Minister can appoint to commissions; the Minister can make any order they deem necessary to carry out the purposes of Part 15.1; and the Minister can make any Regulations they think are necessary to resolve any inconsistencies/confusion in Part 15.1 or in the transitional provisions. ● All commissions currently established will have one year to update their bylaws to align with new requirements in Section 602.09. There are also new requirements for commissions to balance their budgets within a shorter timeframe than previously allowed. Energy Efficiency Alberta Act ● The Act has been repealed and Energy Efficiency Alberta (EEA) as an organization has been dissolved. ● Most remaining programs and services that have been led by Energy Efficiency Alberta (EEA) will transition to Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA). ○ Through ERA, Alberta’s emissions-reduction efforts will focus on the commercial and industrial sectors, which account for more than 65 per cent of the province’s total emissions. ● The City worked with EEA to create and administer energy efficiency programs and these programs may be impacted. ● In addition, EEA was to be the program administrator for the City’s Clean Energy Improvement Program (CEIP) previously known as the Provincially Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan program. ● The dissolution of EEA means that another organization (Municipal Climate Change Action Centre) will become the program administrator but EEA’s demise will likely lead to significant delays to the City’s CEIP program. The government will have to take additional action to insert MCCAC as the program administrator. Other MGA Amendments ● The expense allowances for Councillors and Councillor for improvement districts are no longer deemed to be one-third of their remuneration. ○ Minimal impact to the City unless there are tax implications to Councillors not having a deemed amount for expense allowances. 3 ● The Municipal Government Board has the discretion to record a hearing. ○ Any evidence brought forward by the City at a Municipal Government Board hearing would be tendered as if on the public record so it will not cause an impact if the hearings are recorded. Next Steps Bill 22 received first reading on June 11, 2020. If passed, Bill 22 will come into force upon receiving royal assent. City Administration will continue to monitor the status of the Bill, including the full impacts of any changes to the process and requirements for establishing Regional Services Commissions.

The E-bike rebate is part of the Change Mobility for Climate rebate program which also includes the Electric Vehicle Charger Rebates program. The program contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission and is in line with key priorities under Edmonton’s Strategic Plan , the Energy Transition Strategy and the Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy . The Change for Climate Mobility program has a total budget of $600,000 over 3 years (2020-22) with $150,000 earmarked to the ebike rebate and $450,000 to support the installation of EV chargers. The E-bike rebate provides a rebate of $750 or 30% (whichever is less) and helps Edmontonians electrify their transportation. The E-bike grant program received an overwhelming response with 691 applicants in one week. A total of $50,000 is allocated for 2020 and will be disbursed on a first come first serve basis. This will result in approximately 83 of the 691 applications being awarded for 2020. Unsuccessful applicants will be invited to apply in year two should they meet the requirements and dependent on budget. Administration will conduct further program review and refinement for year two and three including a detailed consideration for a buy local component, a means test, a lower rebate amount, and the inclusion of findings from a GBA+ analysis. City Council will also have an opportunity to review the overall program as part of budget consideration on July 6, 2020. 1 Prior to its launch, Administration engaged with stakeholders on the value of the program including application procedures.

The Fair Deal Panel Report to Government makes a total of 25 recommendations, some of which could have an impact on the City if implemented in the long term. The City of Edmonton provided a submission to the Panel (January 30, 2020) highlighting concerns about a proposal to heighten the level of provincial oversight and control over municipal agreements with the federal government in a manner that would challenge the City’s ability to adequately represent Edmontonians’ clear direction about where and how to channel the City’s limited resources. The City’s main advocacy was to oppose this idea. The advocacy in this regard was successful, with the Panel’s Recommendation #22 that such a move is not necessary or prudent at this time. Recommendation # 22. Make no changes, at this time, to the administration of agreements that Alberta public agencies and municipalities have with the Government of Canada. ● The panel emphasizes that with Alberta facing so many daunting challenges in addition to securing a fairer deal from Ottawa, it is imperative that Alberta’s provincial and municipal governments “pull together” like they have never pulled together before. ● At this time, the benefits of red tape reduction and local autonomy and accountability outweigh any concerns about possible back door federal encroachments for political expediency. Current protocols and practices largely work and should be continually assessed to assure respect for Alberta’s jurisdiction. ● The panel recommends that Alberta consider ways to improve coordination between municipalities and Alberta, and to better manage large-scale infrastructure investment. For example, Alberta could expand the mandate of its office in Ottawa to include working with municipalities, school boards and other public bodies. Providing such concierge and facilitation services could benefit municipalities’ dealings with the federal government. 2 In the Government’s Response to the Panel’s recommendations, this particular recommendation falls under the category of - “recommendations where modifications are required to align with government platform commitments and/or policy direction.” Here is the government’s commentary on how it will address this matter: “While the Government did not commit in its platform to restructuring the relationship with municipalities, working collaboratively with municipalities is critical to ensuring federal funding aligns with provincial outcomes, and has the greatest impact for Albertans. While the majority of federal funding programs are co-ordinated through the Government of Alberta, ways to improve co-ordination between municipalities, the Government of Alberta and the Government of Canada should be continually assessed for efficiency and effectiveness. No changes are anticipated at this time to the relationship between public agencies and other orders/levels of government. However, the Government of Alberta may choose to revisit this in the future.” Aside from that one recommendation which is favourable for the City, the Panel has made other recommendations that could impact the City in the long run. These touch on the City’s interests across a number of business areas including economic, environmental, labour, regional, policing and administrative matters. Panel recommendation Government Response Category 5. Collaborate with other jurisdictions to design and advance regional strategies for northern development; pressure the federal government to implement those strategies Recommendations where work is already underway 9. Assert more control over immigration for the economic benefit of Alberta Recommendations which are agreed to in principle 10. Collaborate with other provinces and industry to advance market-based approaches to environmental protection, including a reduction in GHG emissions Recommendations where work is already underway 12.

As part of that announcement, gyms, recreation centres and pools were moved from Stage 3 to Stage 2, which allowed them to open as early as June 12. While this was earlier than expected, Administration has been preparing for the eventuality that our recreation centres, arenas and indoor pools would be permitted to reopen. We’ve developed a plan that will guide our relaunch of those operations. This planning is in accordance with the corporate principles for reopening facilities and services. At a news conference tomorrow, at 12:45 pm, we will publicly announce our plan for reopening facilities in a phased approach. Fitness facilities Starting on July 6, we will reopen the fitness centres, gyms and fitness studios in the following facilities: ● Commonwealth Community Recreation Centre (July 6) ● Clareview Community Recreation Centre (July 6) ● Terwillegar Community Recreation Centre (July 6) ● The Meadows Community Recreation Centre (July 6) Kinsmen Sports Centre will reopen in July once The Mustard Seed has a new location. As facilities reopen, Edmontonians will see significant changes to reflect Alberta Health guidance , which includes limits on the number of people that can be accommodated in a facility. To help manage this, patrons will need to book a specific time to visit the facility on movelearnplay.edmonton.ca . Those without computer access can call 311 to book a time. The online system will allow users to book things like fitness centre access, studio, court and gymnasium activities. Due to Alberta Health guidelines, higher intensity, instructor-led classes will be offered outdoors. We are also implementing necessary communications and installing on-site signage to help patrons understand restrictions and areas that remain closed to the public. We will have thorough cleaning protocols for these facilities. Arenas Starting on July 2, the following arenas will reopen, following Alberta Health guidelines: ● Kenilworth Arena (July 2) ● Clareview Twin Arena (July 2) ● Londonderry Arena (July 2) ● Callingwood Twin Arena (July 2) ../2 - 2 - ● Mill Woods Twin Arena (July 2) ● Castle Downs Twin Arena (July 6) ● Russ Barnes Arena (July 7) ● The Meadows Twin Arena (July 13) Existing arena bookings will proceed and new bookings will be taken starting on July 2. Drop-in activities such as public skating and shinny will not take place in arenas as per provincial guidance. Indoor Pools The Government of Alberta also announced that pools could open as of June 12 following Alberta Health guidance . This date was earlier than expected and we are reviewing the provincial guidance to ensure we are fully prepared for public use, including meeting Alberta Health requirements for pools, and that we have the necessary staff in place. Upon opening, pools will be restricted to modified lane swimming, aquafit classes, swimming lessons, public swims and rentals. Under Phase 1 of reopening, the following pool facilities will reopen on July 20: ● Clareview Community Recreation Centre aquatics facilities ● Jasper Place Fitness and Leisure Centre (this is a pool-only facility) ● Bonnie Doon Leisure Centre (this is a pool-only facility) Kinsmen Sports Centre aquatics facilities will reopen in July once The Mustard Seed has a new location. Outdoor pools will remain closed this summer as a result of decisions to address the City’s financial situation due to the pandemic. We continue to work on the next phases for reopening the facilities that remain closed. As we confirm those plans, we will update you on which facilities will be next to reopen and the associated timeline.

Originally the City announced that none of the city’s 74 spray parks would open this summer. With the Province recently announcing that spray parks are now included in Stage Two of the Alberta relaunch strategy, ELT has carefully reconsidered financial and COVID-19 impacts and determined it is possible to move forward with opening 25 of the 74 spray parks. Openings will start with the seven largest spray parks: Callingwood, Castle Downs, G. Edmunds Kelly, Glengarry, Jackie Parker, Kinsmen and South Terwillegar. Staged reopening of these parks will begin right away and we will endeavour to have these seven spray parks open as early as this weekend. Remaining locations will be selected following a GBA+/equity analysis and all openings should be completed by early July. The City Hall Fountain is not being recommended to open at this time as it will be included with plans for the reopening of City Hall. Administration will take whatever steps are possible to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among attendees. Given that the outdoor gathering limit is currently set at 100 people by Alberta Health, most spray parks will not allow for gatherings of that size with the required two metres of distancing between people from different households/cohort families. A capacity limit for each park may be considered. Peace Officers will continue to patrol reopened public amenities to ensure public health orders are followed. Officers will focus on educating visitors regarding provincial health guidelines for outdoor spray parks and wading pools . Each spray park will increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting of high touch surfaces and, while masks should not be worn while playing in spray parks and wading pools due to the safety risk, they can be used by staff as necessary.

There is no public exposure or public access to this facility. No City of Edmonton employees are affected. The Material Recovery Facility is owned by the City of Edmonton, but is operated by SUEZ Canada Waste Services Incorporated. SUEZ manages the processing of recyclable materials at the MRF located at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre. 120 to 130 people work at the MRF on two shifts. On June 9, SUEZ advised Waste Services that one of their employees working at the MRF tested positive for COVID-19. Upon notification, all activities at the MRF were suspended and the facility was closed. SUEZ employees who work at the MRF site, were sent home and EWMC City of Edmonton employees were notified of the closure. Since then, SUEZ and Alberta Health Services have confirmed a total of 10 SUEZ employees and their subcontractors have tested positive. SUEZ has been working closely with Alberta Health Services to ensure appropriate COVID-19 protocols are in place and contact tracing and testing are underway. All SUEZ employees are being tested, with 10 tested positive and 61 tested negative at the time. SUEZ operated facilities and procedures Prior to the initial COVID-19 case, staff at the MRF were required to wear masks plus additional personal protective equipment (PPE) when working less than 6 feet apart, follow physical distancing measures, and undergo daily health checks. Employees were also required to self-isolate if he/she had symptoms or was in close contact with someone with a confirmed case. Since being notified of the initial case, SUEZ posted additional posters and signage, and strategically placed additional hand sanitizer/disinfectant stations around the facility. As well, touchless temperature checks are required before each shift. As part of the daily standard cleaning and disinfecting practices, SUEZ hired a contractor to clean and disinfect all facilities. Since the start of COVID-19, all cleaning and disinfecting activities were enhanced 1 in intensity and frequency. All facilities the SUEZ employees may have visited at the EWMC have undergone intensive cleaning and disinfecting. SUEZ also operates and maintains the Anaerobic Digestion Facility (ADF) and only provides maintenance services at the Integrated Processing & Transfer Facility (IPTF), both facilities located at EWMC. Some maintenance staff go back and forth between the MRF and ADF, depending on need. SUEZ has confirmed that those people were not rotating through at the times and location that contamination could have occurred. The IPTF has a mixture of City of Edmonton, SUEZ, and other employees moving throughout on a regular basis. SUEZ employees from the IPTF rarely go to other facilities, and SUEZ has confirmed that none did so during the time potential contamination could have occured. Processing impacts Due to the shutdown of the MRF facility, recyclable materials have been sent to the Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) facility for processing. Very little recyclable materials are currently going to landfill. Additional options are also being explored to send some recyclable material to other third-parties while the City of Edmonton’s MRF is shut down. Residents should continue setting out their recyclables as normal. Waste Services and SUEZ are working together to bring the facility back to full operations as soon as possible. Edmonton Waste Management Centre facts The EWMC is owned and operated by the City of Edmonton It is an integral part of Edmonton’s sustainable approach to waste management. It is located on 233 hectares in size, which is equivalent to more than five West Edmonton Malls. There are nine (9) processing areas on the EWMC , along with five (5) non-processing areas/facilities. The wellbeing of City of Edmonton employees and the public remains our top priority. The MRF and all other facilities that these contractors may have visited at the EWMC have undergone intensive cleaning and disinfecting. We are proceeding with caution and the MRF will remain closed until further notice. Regular waste collection continues and residents should continue to set out their recyclables in blue bags. SUEZ will be coordinating all media inquiries directly related to their employees on this matter.

After careful review and planning, this week we were very excited to announce a number of new City relaunch initiatives in line with the provincial strategy. Today Interim City Manager Adam Laughlin and Roger Jevne, Branch Manager of Community and Recreation Facilities attended a media availability to speak to journalists regarding the City relaunch of recreation facilities, pools, arenas and spray parks. Yesterday the City announced the opening of a select number of recreation facilities and arenas with modified offerings starting in July including: ● Eight City arenas will be opening between July 2 and July 13 ● Four recreation centres will begin opening July 6 ● Kinsmen Sports Centre will open in July once we are able to accommodate the overnight shelter at another location ● Limited aquatics amenities will be available starting July 20 Today we also announced that we will begin reopening 25 spray parks across the city with the seven largest spray parks expected to be operational and ready for enjoyment this weekend. Peace Officers will continue to patrol reopened public amenities to ensure public health orders are followed. To prepare for reopening facilities, we have started the process of bringing some employees currently on temporary layoff back to work.

As the City of Edmonton continues the Relaunch phase for recreation centres, not for profit partners providing assistance to our vulnerable population at Kinsmen Sports Centre, Central Lions Senior Citizens Recreation Centre, and the Edmonton EXPO Centre will experience disruption. Edmonton Gives will look to support these challenges by helping reach out to the Edmonton community for alternative space and support for these organizations. Early July the site will feature a week of City of Edmonton promotions focused on the theme of “YEG Cares”. It will continue to profile community support stories and exemplary efforts by city businesses and will be supported by social media messaging on Twitter and Facebook.

As part of the Stadium LRT Station Redevelopment , crews will be removing the skylight and demolishing walls to prepare for the installation of the new platforms. Concurrently, approximately two kilometres of Capital Line LRT track between 92 Street and Stadium Station will be upgraded this summer, which means trains will be single tracking through the station. Doing the track renewal work at the same time allows crews to safely complete the demolition work one track at a time. As a result, train frequency will be adjusted from June 28 until late-August. From June 28 until August 1, Capital and Metro Line trains will run every 20 minutes while crews work on the southbound track. This results in 20-minute frequency between Churchill and Clareview, and between Churchill and NAIT. Frequency will be every 10 minutes from Churchill to Century Park. From August 2 until late-August, Capital and Metro Line trains will run every 15 minutes while crews work on the northbound track. This will result in 15-minute frequency between Churchill and Clareview, and between Churchill and NAIT. Frequency will average 7.5 minutes from Churchill to Century Park. Unless otherwise indicated, Metro Line trains will run between Century Park and NAIT all day for the entire duration of this project. However, additional work on June 28 and July 4-5 (weather dependent) will require Metro Line trains to only run between Grandin and NAIT. .../2 -2- McKernan/Belgravia LRT Station Update In a previous memo on April 24, information was provided about platform repairs at McKernan/Belgravia LRT Station. Starting on or around June 28 (weather permitting), the remaining construction will occur overnight between 10:30pm and 5:00am for approximately 1-2 weeks as crews install new platform warning tiles along the edge of the platform. During the night work, local residents can expect to hear noise from construction vehicles and grinding equipment. We understand this schedule may cause inconvenience for some residents; however, daytime work is not possible due to the above mentioned work on the Capital Line. McKernan/Belgravia station is expected to re-open in mid-July when construction is complete. Administration has an integrated marketing and communications plan that informs transit riders, residents near the tracks and other stakeholders about major LRT maintenance and revitalization projects. Customers and stakeholders will be informed through edmonton.ca/tlcforlrt, ETS social media and signage at stations. By continuing to advance these maintenance and revitalization projects, the City shows its commitment to long-term LRT operations and enhanced customer experience.

Administration’s updated strategy included two separate procurement processes, one for the Valley Line West infrastructure as a Design-Build-Finance and a separate procurement for light rail vehicles. This memo provides an update for the separate procurement of light rail vehicles since November 18, 2019. Through Q1 and Q2 of 2020, Administration engaged in constructive dialogue with Bombardier for the directly sourced supply of 40 additional light rail vehicles for Valley Line West to complement the expected 26-vehicle Valley Line Southeast fleet already being supplied by Bombardier. This would bring the total number of light rail vehicles for the full Valley Line to 66. In May 2020, Administration terminated its negotiations with Bombardier without reaching consensus on a draft agreement. Key considerations included Bombardier’s proposed pricing, commercial terms and risk transfer, uncertainty caused by Bombardier’s corporate restructuring and the pending acquisition of Bombardier’s rail division by Alstom. As a result of this, Administration is now moving forward with its alternate plan for an open competition for light rail vehicles supply in the Fall of 2020. Administration expects to execute a contract with the successful supplier in the late summer of 2021. This will allow time to integrate the selected vehicles’ specifications with the ongoing Design-Build contract. 1 Administration is also investigating potential opportunities for a joint light rail vehicle procurement process with the City of Calgary. Discussions are ongoing as the City of Calgary prepares to issue its request for proposals (RFP) to its shortlisted supplier candidates in mid-June 2020. It is anticipated that the viability of this opportunity will be understood well in advance of the potential launch date for a City of Edmonton supply competition in late September/October 2020.

We were able to quickly open four of the spray parks by 6 p.m. on Friday. Only two washroom facilities were open at the various sites this weekend but we are working to have additional washrooms/changerooms open as soon as possible. City enforcement officers reported that most adults were physically distancing but noted that children playing in the spray were too busy enjoying the water to keep their distance. TEMPORARY PATIOS: This work continues to be a collaborative effort across Economic & Environmental Sustainability, Development Services, and Parks and Roads Services. To date we have processed 62 temporary patios submissions as well as five outdoor retail space submissions. There has been some public pushback on the street-closure portion of the program mainly related to traffic increases and lack of parking. The program appears to be meeting its intended outcomes by supporting businesses by allowing increased space for physical distancing and add capacity for the restaurants. ECONOMIC RECOVERY GRANT: The Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant is available to help Edmonton businesses recover from COVID-19.

To date we have awarded 32 Individual Business grants and we anticipate a large volume of Individual Business Grant applications each week. We have not received any Organizational Grant applications but we have received significant interest from associations and organizations. RECREATION DATA: An Insight Survey was sent out on June 9th to determine Edmontonians’ recreation habits in the past year, including during the COVID-19 health emergency. Just over half (51%) of over 3000 respondents have been to a City of Edmonton recreation facility in the past year while 29% went to no fitness facilities. With recreation centres and gyms closed during the health emergency, more than half of respondents to the questions about paid online fitness options (apps and classes) used them more than they usually do and up to 18% used a paid online option for the first time. Nearly 80% of people are willing to participate in additional engagement activities about recreation facilities and attractions.

The EOC was activated on March 17, 2020, by the Interim City Manager/Director of Emergency Management as part of the C","of the City’s overall response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As public health restrictions have been lifted, and moving in lockstep with the Province, the City has shifted from COVID-19 response to the COVID-19 Relaunch/Recovery/Reimagine stages that are managed by two dedicated Task Teams. Requests for assistance to the EOC and the need for emergency management support have also significantly declined. EOC Director/Deputy Fire Chief Rob Squire has done a fantastic job directing the EOC through its longest activation in recent history and he will remain an integral member of the Relaunch & Recover Task Team. The EOC can be stood up again at a moment’s notice if needed. NON-MEDICAL FREE MASKS: The first phase of Alberta’s distribution of free non-medical masks has ended.

Stage 2 of the Provincial Relaunch Strategy allows for gatherings of less than 100 people outdoors with new restrictions. Effective immediately the City will allow limited event licensing of modified events on public land where City supports are available. Numerous City and provincial health restrictions will apply to events on public land and we will support the review of requests on private land. RIVER VALLEY PICNIC AND SMALL EVENT BOOKINGS: In response to COVID-19 public health orders in mid-March, the City announced the suspension of rental bookings of City picnic sites and event licensing throughout the city. In alignment with provincial Stage 2 guidelines, effective July 4, a limited number of picnic site bookings and spaces for small scale events of 100 people or fewer will be allowed in select River Valley locations. All other picnic sites, including non-River Valley locations remain available for spontaneous, non-booked use only.

This does not include the hours spent or tickets written as part of the five joint operations with EPS Operation TENSOR (Traffic Enforcement Noise/Speed Offence Reduction) conducted on May 22, May 30, June 5, June 13, and June 19 which are being captured by EPS. The vehicle noise pilot is progressing and three st","ree stationary locations have been installed with cameras and noise meters.

Further to that discussion, please find additional information below: Drivers for Increases in Transit Ridership Ridership can be affected by internal and external levers. Internal levers are factors the City can control, such as fare pricing, service levels, safety and security measures, and transit-oriented development decisions. External levers are things the City does not control, like employment levels in the region and fuel prices. Key elements that riders highlight as important include (in no particular order): ● Good connections ● Service frequency ● Value for fare ● Trip duration ● On-time reliable service ● Safety and security ● Access to information & communications ● Hours of operation ● Bus stop convenience Who is Riding Transit? In terms of who takes transit, the transit industry recognizes two main types of riders: those who take transit because it is their only method of transportation, and those who have transportation options but prefer to take transit. During the months of March, April and May, transit ridership decreased significantly by approximately 80%. As businesses, schools, post-secondary institutions and other services closed, fewer people used transit to commute. In many instances, office buildings closed and many employees began working from home, resulting in fewer weekday commuters. The temporary suspension of fares saw an increase in non-destination riders using the system. Transit was deemed an essential service by the Government of Canada and when applying Gender Based Analysis, women, lower income residents, as well as healthcare and other essential service workers continue to rely on Edmonton’s transit service during the pandemic for essential activities like grocery shopping, healthcare appointments and work. ../2 -2- Transit riders, who used TransitApp for their trip information during the pandemic, were asked to participate in a survey about their usage during the pandemic. Results from a sample of the Edmonton users of TransitApp indicated: ● 57% of respondents were women ● 82% of respondents did not have access to a car ● 89% of respondents were under the age of 54 (which might be indicative of users who have access to a smartphone and who use TransitApp as part of their transit journey) ● Top three reasons for using transit during the pandemic were work, errands and healthcare Who Will be Using Transit? As relaunch stages are underway, ETS has started to see an increase in ridership to approximately 50% of pre-pandemic levels. Ridership modeling indicates the likely scenario is ridership levels will be hovering around 60% of 2019 levels by December. Canadian transit industry research from Abacus Data indicates people will use transit again as long as there is: ● Continued enhanced cleaning and disinfecting ● Use of masks by riders ● Staff using Personal Protective Equipment ● No crowding on buses and trains During the pandemic, there was a heightened focus from Administration on measures to protect the health and safety of riders and employees, to ensure a safe experience for all. Administration will continue this work to enhance safety and security, including promoting mask usage as well as continuing the enhanced cleaning and disinfecting of transit centres, LRT stations and transit vehicles. Administration will continue to support and align with Alberta Health Services’ guidelines. To recover ridership to pre-pandemic levels, transit properties will need to focus on reassuring customers that transit service delivery is as clean and safe as possible. ETS is also further examining, through customer research, the key elements that riders are looking for in order to return to transit over the coming months. If further questions on transit ridership and drivers arise please contact Eddie Robar, Branch Manager, ETS at eddie.robar@edmonton.ca. GC/rs c: Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk",,"No",,,

This was reported to Development Services, Safety Codes, Permits and Inspections on June 23, 2020 by a resident. Background: The City initially approved a development and building permit application for the construction of a fourplex; however, the development permit was appealed to the Subdivision and Appeal Board (SDAB). Construction had already commenced at this point, but was paused because the SDAB refused the permit. The developer has applied for a new development and building permit for the construction of a three plex that would not require variances or be subject to an appeal. The City has been working with the developer to expedite the process so that construction can resume. To date, the Safety Codes, Permits and Inspections team has conducted four site visits to check for unsafe conditions, with the most recent on June 24, 2020. Each site check concluded there were no unsafe conditions related to access, water accumulation or any visible damage to adjacent properties. A Safety Codes Officer also spoke with during those visits, who expressed concern with the open excavation and had been communicating with the builder regarding these concerns, and the builder had shared their hope to resume construction shortly. 1 17(1) 17(1) 17(1) Next Steps: The Safety Codes, Permits and Inspections team is working with the developer, their engineer and the homeowner to find a quick solution.

The revis ed Bike Plan has been developed with extensive consultation over the last few years. But in context of the rapidly changing circumstances that have emerged in 2020, we want to take this opportunity to add some further internal review. As soon as we’ve completed this review, we will repost the Bike Plan to our website. We look forward to sharing this and will be happy to discuss the plan in detail then. BACKGROUND ● The Bike Plan provides strategic direction for how the City plans, designs, implements, operates, and maintains bike infrastructure and programs. ○ The Bike Plan is an update to the 2009 Bicycle Transportation Plan. It is based on learnings and advancements from the past ten years, including recent changes to Edmonton’s bike network and the rapid evolution of bike planning best practices. ○ One of the key deliverables of the Bike Plan is the future bike network map which will guide the expansion of Edmonton’s bike network by identifying the general location of future bike routes in the city. The future bike network was informed by spatial analysis along with other inputs such as feedback from Edmontonians to gain a better understanding of Edmonton’s population, land use and transportation context. ○ The Bike Plan is centred on an accessible network and associate programs that consider all ages and abilities. This includes women, children, visible minorities, low-income riders, and people with disabilities. ○ The Bike Plan recognizes that facilities are used by multiple users including e-bikes, e-scooters, wheelchairs and mobility scooters. ○ The Bike Plan also recognizes that a complete bike system requires actions around program areas across multiple areas including integration with transit, end-of-trip facilities and education. 1 ○ Engagement in support of the Bike Plan occurred over two years through 62 public events including workshops, pop up events, drop-in sessions, surveys and community conversations. Over 11,500 Edmontonians provided their feedback and insights about biking in Edmonton. What We Heard reports for each phase of work are available on the project website. ○ Next steps: ■ The implementation plan for the future bike network will outline implementation costs and scenarios. It will inform engagement, planning and the design of future bike routes. The implementation plan is expected to be complete by Q3 this year. ■ Administration will bring the implementation plan to Urban Planning Committee as council and committee schedules allow. ■ As part of the implementation approach update, Administration will respond to the December 9, 2019, Urban Planning Committee motion that will “include a high level analysis from other cities’ learnings of the potential economic impact of bike facilities.” The project documents on approach and public engagement undertaken can be found on the City’s website.

A news release was also issued with information regarding recent relaunch activities. NON-MEDICAL MASKS IN PUBLIC: There is widespread public, media and Council interest in the actions of other municipalities to make the wearing of non-medical masks mandatory in enclosed public spaces including businesses and facilities. Wearing a non-medical mask in public may help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and it should complement – not replace – other prevention measures such as physical distancing and regular hand washing. The City of Edmonton’s response to COVID-19 has and will continue to follow the guidance and direction of Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services. The decision to implement mandatory masking is a significant measure that would require additional resources and should be done in close consultation with these health authorities. While mandatory masking for all public city-owned facilities or privately-owned publicly accessible indoor facilities is not currently recommended, there are some circumstances where provincial and public health guidance have indicated masks are strongly encouraged to be worn. Masks are encouraged whenever physical distancing is difficult to achieve. In these circumstances, masking is identified in the appropriate hazard assessment.

YARD AND GARAGE SALES: On April 21, 2020, garage sales in Edmonton were restricted as a non-essential business. Following stage two of the provincial relaunch strategy allowing most businesses to open and new Alberta Health guidance allowing for larger outdoor gatherings, we will now be removing the restriction on garage sales. New City yard/garage sale guidelines have been created and posted online to help sellers hold a garage or yard sale safely including: overall responsibility for provincial guidelines, physical distancing, cleaning and disinfecting, sanitizer availability, personal care, and food and beverages. The City will not take a role in enforcing health measures at garage sales, but will instead direct questions and concerns to the provincial guidelines. EDMONTON OILERS AND NHL HUB CITY STATUS: Today Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw held a media availability to discuss the latest COVID-19 information including the potential for Edmonton to become a hub city for NHL playoffs. She has also provided the Edmonton Oilers Hockey Club with an exemption to Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) Order 05-2020 which now permits players from outside of Canada to join their training camps with additional requirements and conditions which are set out in the exemption. The exemption describes requirements for testing, quarantine and isolation to help protect public health. It also permits team and broadcaster cohorts with similar requirements.

These social enterprise agreements provide citizens struggling to overcome the impacts of poverty, homelessness and marginalization a way to obtain meaningful employment while also providing important litter collection services to the community. Capital City Clean Up is working with Downtown Proud! to expand its services from litter and needle collection to include power washing sidewalks and trimming long grass and weeds. While dedicated litter collection and needle patrols will still occur in the downtown area, the agreement has been enhanced to ensure these services are now available to support Capital City Clean Up initiatives throughout the city. The Old Strathcona Business Association purchased two mobile cleaning carts for the Old Strathcona Clean initiative, expanding its litter and needle clean up operation. These bins assist with the storage of tools and bags of litter. A new social enterprise initiative, similar to Downtown Proud! and Old Strathcona Clean, was started on June 1, 2020, in the Chinatown Business Improvement Area and McCauley neighbourhood. The six month initiative is a partnership between Capital City Clean Up and the McCauley Revitalization Area and will include staff hired from The Mustard Seed Society. The initiative includes dedicated litter and needle collection from public property. Capital City Clean Up is exploring further initiatives to better support the city that will expand its needle collection program to also include private property collection. Capital City Clean Up continues to pursue initiatives such as these that address societal needs while providing important services to the public. Should you have any questions regarding these initiatives, please contact Andrew Jabs, Capital City Clean Up Program Manager, at 780.496.5238 or andrew.jabs@edmonton.ca .

The first five arenas reopened were Clareview, Londonderry, Mill Woods, Callingwood, and Kenilworth. Many groups that had their ice time booked previously were eager to return and there are many new groups calling to schedule time. Sport rentals have been very popular with arenas receiving approximately 30 new bookings per day from a mixture of new and historical users. This compares to around 10 new bookings per day historically. Sports field booking requests volume remains high with 30-40 inquiries per day but requests for artificial turf and staffed facilities remain low. Commonwealth, Clareview, Terwillegar, and The Meadows recreation centres opened their doors to the public for the first time today since March 14. A new video was released online to showcase some of the changes visitors can expect. A news release was also issued on Friday. Should there be an increase in COVID-19 case numbers, the City of Edmonton can temporarily re-close the facilities. Training and orientation for approximately 350 employees began Friday, July 3, to help make certain everyone is familiar with the new healthy and safety measures in place in accordance with provincial guidelines. The new measures will help ensure a safe return to recreation facilities for staff and patrons alike. New layouts and ways of navigating through the facilities were introduced, as well as a significant amount of new signage.

As clients arrive at their pre-booked times, staff are on hand to guide them through the newly designated paths that will allow them to travel safely to their scheduled activity. PICNIC SITE BOOKINGS: Picnic site booking requests remain high with approximately 50-60 requests daily. The new limited capacity for bookings (12 sites, once per day compared to 50 sites, 2-3 times daily) is quickly being filled, especially on weekends. SENIORS CENTRES: Beginning July 13, seniors associations at the three City of Edmonton operated Seniors Centres will resume operations and reopen to their members in accordance with Alberta Health guidelines starting with Northgate Lions Seniors Centre / North Edmonton Seniors Association. Central Lions Seniors Centre / Central Lions Seniors Association will resume operations September 14 to allow time for the exit of Hope Mission from the facility in late July and to allow for facility maintenance. The Mill Woods Seniors & Multicultural Centre / Mill Woods Seniors Association is also targeting September 14 to reopen. In order to reopen the Seniors Centres to the licensed Seniors Associations for use, full time Facility Maintenance Services custodial workers that were redeployed elsewhere within the City of Edmonton will return to the Centres. Should there be an increase in COVID-19 case numbers, the City of Edmonton can temporarily re-close the facilities. EDMONTON VALLEY ZOO: Total attendance between June 15 – July 4 was 18,305 visitor bookings of the 25,690 spots available, resulting in a 71% fill rate. This is very good attendance considering 10 of 20 days have been rainy since opening. Visitors completed 656 surveys for the first two weeks of timed ticket opening. The responses show an overall satisfaction level of 87%. Satisfaction with staff was 99% and satisfaction with COVID-19 safety measures was 91%. Direct feedback from visitors includes comments about their overall feeling of a safe and positive experience. We will be scheduling a change from special prices to regular summer prices effective Saturday, July 11. Senior Centres get set to reopen Zoo attendance and satisfaction are on the rise. 17(1) LOCAL ECONOMY: The One-On-One business support program received a record high 111 inquiries in June of this year which is 2.6 times high","6 times higher than the same month last year. The most inquiries previously received in one month was 81 in October 2019. We also received 485 unique emails to businessinfo@edmonton.ca ranging in topics from grant and financial support to patio questions and submissions and one-on-one inquiries. We approved one more temporary patio this week for a new total of 64 patios and five temporary outdoor retail spaces. EDMONTON ECONOMIC RECOVERY GRANTS: This is the third week we are accepting applications for the City Stream of the Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG). We received 75 applications for the EERG in less than 20 minutes of applications becoming available online. Next week we will increase the number of available applications to 100 as we continue to receive applications for ineligible costs (rent, salary, etc). This intake we received 55 eligible, approved applications that will receive $1,000 grants from the June 29 intake period. This is an increase from last week when 47 were approved. This demonstrates that the changes made last week to better communicate eligibility have supported stronger applications. The top 3 industries represented this week are: “Other services” = 20 (13 last week) including nails/spa services, cleaning businesses, IT, and travel agencies; accommodation/food services = 15 (16 last week); and health care & social assistance = 12 (9 last week). PROVINCIAL RELAUNCH GRANTS: The Province’s Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grant (SMERG) was announced on June 28. It offers up to 15% of pre-COVID revenue with a maximum of $5,000 per business. Businesses must demonstrate a 50% or more decline in revenue due to public health orders between April-May 2020 in order to be eligible. Funding may be used for any purpose by the business, including rent and payroll. The City’s grant differs from SMERG in two key ways: ● Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG) encourages business pivots aimed at economic development and diversification and is a matching grant. It does not support costs such as rent or payroll, debt reduction, insurance or utilities. ● Approximately 25% of the businesses applying for EERG would not be eligible to apply for Provincial funding as their revenues have dropped less than 50%. KINSMEN SHELTER: The Kinsmen Sport Centre overnight shelter, which has been operated by The Mustard Seed Edmonton since March 30, ceased operations at that location last night. During operations the shelter hosted approximately 14,646 overnight stays by members of the City’s vulnerable population. Additional staff will be on hand over the next few days at the Kinsmen Sports Centre to redirect any shelter users to other services such as the Central Lions shelter. ETS SHELTER SHUTTLE SERVICE: The last Edmonton Transit Service bus shuttles from the EXPO Centre shelter ceased operations this morning, including the downtown and Kinsmen/Mustard Seed shuttles. We will post signage at the EXPO shelter site to inform clients that the service is no longer available. We have provided a number of transit options for clients over the last few weeks including bus tickets, Leisure Access Program (LAP) and low income transit in anticipation of this service removal. OUTDOOR FITNESS PROGRAMS: Total attendance for outdoor fitness program from June 29 - July 5 was 508 of the 1,500 spots available. This represents a fill rate of 39% which may be due in large part to recent wet weather. Of the 84 surveys completed by clients, the overall satisfaction rate was 99% with a 99% likelihood to return and 100% satisfaction with COVID-19 safety measures. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION TRANSIT RIDERSHIP: Bus-only transit ridership for the week of June 28-July 4 was 478,682 weekday passenger boardings. Ridership has recovered to 50% of normal operational levels, compared to 2019 levels. YARD AND GARAGE SALE MONITORING: City enforcement officers monitored local advertisements for garage and yard sales and identified 20 listings for the weekend. Patrols found six garage sales operating. Five were screening customers, ensuring there was physical distancing in place and had masks, hand sanitizer, and signage available. They were also frequently cleaning the items for sale. Only one of the six sales was busy while the others reported only a few customers. Officers provided Guideline documents to each sale operator and they were generally happy to be given the printed guidelines. One garage sale had approximately 10 people on site with no physical distancing being practiced, masks or hand sanitizer available. Officers advised the operator of the guidelines at that time and they stated they would cooperate with the instructions. COVID-19 RISK INDEX: Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel from the University of Pennsylvania and Special Advisor to the Director General of the World Health Organization, along with colleagues Professor Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona and Dr. James P. Phillips, MD, the Chief of Disaster Medicine at GWU Emergency Medicine have published the following graphic to illustrate various levels of COVID-19 risk associated daily activities.

The Office of the City Clerk will be advancing proposed dates for a dedicated Public Hearing in mid-September 2020. This represents a change in approach from the governance process envisioned pre-COVID19 which envisioned that a future Public Hearing would be preceded by a final information report to Urban Planning Committee (UPC) with the draft Plan. Background Since the project began in 2018, The City Plan has been to UPC for information four times. The last Committee meeting was held in September 2019 where the draft land use concept and plan policies were presented. On February 10, 2020 (see attachment), the draft City Plan and all technical documents were posted to the City of Edmonton’s website and a Council Information Session was held on February 19, 2020. On March 5, 2020, the March 16 UPC agenda was published, which included the complete draft City Plan and associated attachments ( see material here ). As part of the City’s Reimagine process, the City Plan will play a critical role in Edmonton’s recovery. Therefore, it is important that Council be in position to debate and vote on the bylaw.

The Reimagine recommendations are the basis of Administration’s corporate workplan and will better position Edmonton to recover from the health challenges of a pandemic and the economic contraction affecting the province. Mayor Don Iveson and Interim City Manager Adam Laughlin held a media availability to answer journalists’ questions about the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the City’s Reimagine path forward. TRANSIT: Today the Government of Alberta posted their Stage 2 guidance for public transit online. This document was developed to support public transit providers in reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 among drivers, other workers, and passengers. The guidance outlines public health and infection prevention and control measures, specific to public transit settings. Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) was able to review the guidance in advance and provided feedback as part of the Canadian Urban Transit Association delegation to Alberta Health to ensure that the risk mitigation guidelines are consistent with current ETS COVID-19 prevention measures. Many of the current prevention protocols and suggested safety measures are highlighted in an ETS video shared on social media today.

Specifically, they will guide the preservation, enhancement and development of the southwest and northeast sections of the river valley and ravine system, and the network of public places in the downtown. Extensive public engagement was undertaken to support each project, and the completed reports are now being made available to the public. BACKGROUND ● Breathe is the City’s high-level framework for the entire open space network. It is an aspirational long-term vision of the City’s open space assets. ● The Ribbon of Green SW+NE provides guidance on locations for development and preservation within the river valley and ravine system, following the higher level direction of Breathe, for the southwest and northeast sections of the river valley. ○ The Ribbon of Green SW-NE was created with extensive engagement with internal/external stakeholders and provides guidance for daily operations of Integrated Infrastructure Services, Citizen Services, and City Operations Departments related to: ■ how to protect, develop, program, and animate the River Valley; ■ how to classify, plan, and prioritize the trail network; and ■ guidance for Council, Citizen, Partner, and Developer inquires. 1 ○ Next Steps ■ Administration has initiated work for the central area of the City’s river and ravine system. Once complete, a consolidated and simplified Ribbon of Green framework will be available for the entire river valley network. ● The Downtown Public Places Plan (DPPP) outlines an enhanced open space network for Downtown Edmonton and The Quarters. ○ The DPPP implements The Capital City Downtown Plan and Breathe . ○ It provides a detailed outline of open space given desired intensification in The Quarters and Downtown Community Revitalization Levy areas, with relatively few existing quality open spaces. ○ The DPPP provides the strategy and guidance that has been missing around land acquisition and a network approach to connect and program open spaces in this important and evolving district. ○ Projects such as the Warehouse Campus Park in the downtown are already implementing the DPPP. ○ The DPPP will enable coordinated budget prioritization with respect to further enhancements to the downtown area’s open space network.

The City of Edmonton may be in a position to attain a grant of up to $10 million of the estimated full project cost of $24.6 million. When the proposal was prepared, $8.2 million had already been committed, with the remaining amount planned in the current and next capital budget cycles without rate impact. At the time of submission, a partner was not named in the City's proposal as this was to be determined in the future. Capital Power, who currently has exclusive rights to the use of the landfill gas until August 31, 2024 under the Electricity Conversion Agreement, also submitted a proposal. This led to the City and Capital Power competing for the same grant. While declining the two separate submissions, the ERA approved a grant pending a new joint agreement between the City and Capital Power on a new Landfill Gas to Renewable Natural Gas project (LFG to RNG). Due to the dollar value of the potential project, and before a new LFG to RNG project agreement is finalized, the City must assess and overcome a number of grant conditions such as significant procurement, legal and agreement timeline hurdles, including operational startup within three years of the grant being awarded.

For the July 6 Intake the Local Economy team approved 68 businesses for $1,000 Individual Business Grants. We have also received eight applications from a variety of partners for Organizational Grants and will begin evaluating these as a batch next week. This week we met GBA+ inclusivity targets with 58/68 (85%) grants going to business owners from underrepresented groups, and 24/68 (35%) grants going to businesses that support underrepresented groups. We have met the GBA+ target each week the grant has been operational. The top three uses for the grant money based on four weeks of intake data include; workplace safety measures (PPE purchases, sanitation products, plexiglass shields) and health & safety training; establishing or updating an online presence; and marketing. This demonstrates that the grant is not only meeting the business sustainability goals but is also contributing to public health and safety through PPE provisions. This shows that the top three core grant criteria that are being met include COVID-19 impact, financial sustainability, and business transformation. EDMONTON VALLEY ZOO: For the week of July 5-11 the Edmonton Valley Zoo continued to be a popular relaunch destination even with the rain (five of seven days) with 6,023 reservations filled of 9,800 available. Of 153 visitor surveys completed, there was an overall satisfaction rating of 85% and an 87% satisfaction rating for COVID-19 safety measures. OUTDOOR FITNESS PROGRAM: For the week of July 12 City outdoor fitness programs saw 508 of 1,200 available bookings filled. Of the 84 client surveys completed, there was a 99% overall satisfaction rating, 99% satisfaction with COVID-19 safety measures and 99% of those surveyed planned to return for more classes. Temporary outdoor patios/retail spaces on the rise Recovery Grants are meeting GBA+ targets OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFO","& INFORMATION SPRAY PARKS: City Enforcement officers have been made aware of social media posts expressing concern about the number of people attending City spray parks at one time. Current Alberta Health gathering restrictions allow for gatherings of a maximum of 100 people as long as physical distancing can be maintained. Weekend patrols of spray parks observed gatherings of 10-80 people with appropriate physical distancing in most cases. Terwillegar Park saw the largest gatherings but physical distancing was maintained with the exception of children when playing in the water. VEHICLE NOISE: Since April 24, 2020, 226 hours have been allocated to noise enforcement with 100 fines issued. There were no additional fines this week. Eight joint operations have been conducted with Edmonton Police Service: May 22, May 30, June 5, June 13, June 19, June 27, July 3, and July 10. The vehicle noise pilot is active and officers are using the meters as part of their data analytics to deploy enforcement to target key areas. ENCAMPMENTS: From July 7-14 the Ranger Encampment Team received 110 calls for service from 311 and other internal agencies. 54 occupied or vacant encampments were cleaned of debris by City Operations and another 29 were referred to City Operations for cleanup. A remaining 56 encampment files require investigation and 33 known camps are currently being monitored. Encampments are not being removed unless they present a safety hazard. There have been 186 total encampment files closed. To date in 2020 we have received 2,275 calls for service with 2,245 encampment files investigated and closed. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section (DOCS) provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. The data shows that week 25 (June 15 - 21) had the highest number of occurrences recently and the following two weeks have declined since then, with week 27 (June 29 – July 6) being at the average for the prior three years at this time. EPS also continues to see higher file numbers this year referred to the DOCS Detectives (106 YTD compared to 85 this time last year). This shows an increase in files needing focused investigation due to serious or complex factors that impact the severity of the violence and/or risk of further abuse INTERGOVERNMENTAL UPDATE: July 14 update TRANSIT DATA: Bus-only transit ridership for the week of July 5-11 was 518,506 weekday passenger boardings. Ridership has recovered to 51% of normal operational levels, compared to 2019 levels. COVID-19 IN ALBERTA","No",,,

CURRENT ACTIONS (Immediate) 1. That a Notice of Intention to Designate a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1, be served on the owners of the property located at 10517 - 126 Street NW in accordance with Section 26 of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9.1 2. That the City Manager be appointed to implement matters arising from the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Designate the Munroe Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1. FUTURE ACTIONS (At least 60 days after the Notice of Intention to Designate is served) 1. Pursuant to the provisions of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9, a Bylaw to Designate the Munroe Residence as Municipal Historic 1 On November 26, 2019, City Council passed amendments to the City Administration Bylaw delegating approval of Notices of Intention to Designate (NOI) under the Historical Resources Act (HRA) to the City Manager, where the owner consents to the designation of their property. The NOI initiates the designation process under the Historical Resources Act ; the final decision on designation remains with City Council by way of a bylaw. 1 Resource (the “Bylaw”) will be brought forward to Council for their consideration. 2. If approved, the Bylaw and corresponding Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will contemplate funding of up to $9,367.36 to be provided from the Heritage Resources Reserve to fund City-funded work on the Munroe Residence, as described in Attachment 5. BACKGROUND The Munroe Residence is on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton, and merits designation under City Policy C450B - Policy to Encourage the Designation and Rehabilitation of Municipal Historic Resources in Edmonton. On May 13, 2020, the owners completed the application requirements to have the Munroe Residence, located at 10517 - 126 Street NW, designated as a Municipal Historic Resource under the provisions of City Policy C450B. If designated, any future renovation of the Munroe Residence will be required to meet the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the Heritage Resources Reserve will pay the owner up to $9,367.36 for rehabilitation. The current Reserve balance is sufficient to cover the committed funding, including the Munroe Residence. The total estimated cost of the restoration work for the project is $18,734.72. Beyond the $9,367.36 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, the owner is responsible for all costs of the restoration work for the project. The projections for the Reserve (using current commitments) anticipate a Reserve balance of $1,431,279.61 at the end of 2020. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. Based on the current commitments, the Reserve balance is anticipated to decline to a balance of $453,840.68 at the end of 2021. The Reserve is funded by the tax levy on an annual basis ($2.3 million in 2019 including $418,000 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd).

At this time, this case is believed to be unrelated to the case from July 9, when a fleet maintenance employee at Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage tested positive. City of Edmonton Position: Our top priority is the health and safety of ETS employees and the public. As soon as we learned of this employee’s positive test result, we began taking action. Contact tracing was done by the City with the employees who shared equipment with the Operator during the period in question. Alberta Health Services (AHS) is also conducting their contact tracing and will determine any further actions required. We will follow the advice and recommendations of AHS. Key Messages: ● Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and the public. ● We can confirm there was a positive case at Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. ○ We were alerted to this positive case late on Friday, July 17. ○ The employee’s last day at the garage was Tuesday, July 14. ○ At this time this case is believed to be unrelated to the positive case from July 9. ● We have a duty to protect the privacy of each City employee, and can not share specific information about routes and assigned shifts. ● The City of Edmonton has a detailed and comprehensive process for addressing positive COVID-19 cases among its workforce and is positioned to take an active and rapid response for assessing and managing risk internally and to the public. ● Upon learning of this positive case, immediate steps were taken to protect the health and safety of other employees and the public. ● A comprehensive workplace assessment has been completed by the City of Edmonton to help AHS identify close contacts and determine transmission risk. ● AHS is currently conducting contact tracing and will determine if further steps are needed. We will follow the further advice and recommendation of AHS. Public Safety ● All transit vehicles are cleaned and then disinfected daily using an electrostatic sprayer. Furthermore, all Bus Operators sit behind a protective shield when driving a bus, and have been instructed to disinfect surfaces in the Operator compartment throughout their shift and to wear a mask when they leave the Operator compartment. For these reasons, the risk of infection to transit riders is extremely low. ● It continues to be safe to take public transit. ● We continue to use a new disinfecting agent applied daily with an electrostatic sprayer to all ETS vehicles before they go into service, at transit centres and LRT stations. Approach: ETS leadership has contacted any employees who may have come in contact with equipment shared with the affected employee during the period in question, and communicated with all employees within the branch. ETS has also been in touch with Amalgamated Transit Union Local 569. The City will follow the advice and recommendations of AHS, including if public notification is necessary as a precautionary measure. Communications will work with ETS to ensure any affected staff have the information they need and are supported, while protecting the employee’s privacy. Should it be determined that there is risk to passengers or other transit users who may have been in close contact with the Operator, a public communications strategy will be developed and delivered. Background: The Operator was working out of Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. Their last day of work was July 14, and contact tracing was conducted by the City for the period of July 9 to 14, as per recommendation of AHS. The Operator began their shift in the garage and ended on the road. All other Operators who shared equipment with this Operator have been directed to seek testing and stay home until test results are returned. Operators continue to use buses with shields to create a physical barrier between themselves and passengers. The Operator confirmed that they have only driven buses with shields, and they wear a mask when outside of the shielded area. Unrelated to this case, an AHS health inspector and an Alberta Occupational Health and Safety inspector conducted a site visit at Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage on July 15. The visit focused on the entire building and Operator protocols were also discussed. The inspectors’ suggestions for improvement were very minor and overall they were very impressed with the protocols and procedures ETS ha","s ETS has in place.

Administration continues to meet twice a week with Alberta Health Services (AHS) and follow the advice of Dr. Deena Hinshaw, provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health, and Dr. Christopher Sikora, Edmonton Zone Lead Medical Officer of Health as we monitor active case rates and outbreaks in the Edmonton Health Zone. With active case rates rising in many places across Canada, Administration has developed a Mandatory Mask Decision Model to help guide us on when mask use may require mandating in Edmonton. The guide includes five different levels of mask use from highly recommended during low Edmonton active case thresholds, up to a provincial order for mandatory mask use. Fact-based indicators could include increased active case rates, a renewed state of local emergency and provincial pandemic response triggers. Edmonton currently remains at level one. Input on mandatory masks and response levels will be based on twice weekly administration meetings with AHS and the Zone Emergency Operations Centre (ZEOC) pandemic team, review of outbreak numbers per zone, review of transfer nuances (respiratory, contact, aerosol) review of outbreak clusters, and grouping and tracing success/failure. We will also make decisions based on active COVID-19 case thresholds and case numbers relating to tracking at City facilities, programs or services, active cases at the EXPO Centre and shelters, City employee active cases and general trends, case numbers, outbreaks in specific groups (i.e. the vulnerable population).

The City of Edmonton has a low overall active case rate of 19.8 per 100,000 people. At this time neither the provincial government or the City is calling for mandatory mask use but we are prepared to make data driven decisions quickly if such action is needed.

This includes within all public vehicles (transit, taxis, etc), city facilities and properties, and public offices, shops and stores. Signs must be prominently displayed in all these settings. Calgary’s approach will be on education and not enforcement, with the expectation that a bylaw will increase the number of people wearing face coverings. Their Council will review the bylaw wording one more time on July 27, with the bylaw coming into effect no late","later than August 1. NHL HUB CITY: The City of Edmonton is a hub city for the 2020 NHL Stanley Cup playoffs. As part of this agreement, the Downtown Community Arena and Terwillegar Recreation Centre arenas will be used by the NHL. This requires previously allocated arena bookings at those facilities to be moved to other facilities that will need to be relaunched. Additional arenas for relaunch are Bill Hunter Arena, Donnan Arena, Glengarry Arena, Coronation Arena, and Westwood Arena. LOCAL ECONOMY: The One-on-One Support Program has continued to be in high demand and we have had 38 inquiries since July 1st. The City is seeing a significant number of home-based business inquiries from first-time entrepreneurs over the past months. Since last week the Local Economy team has approved an additional five outdoor patios and one temporary outdoor retail space, for a program total of 85 temporary patio approvals across the city (78 temporary patios and seven temporary outdoor retail spaces) since May 20. We are starting to see unique requests for tents etc. in relation to NHL playoffs. We are working closely with Civic Events on those requests that are outside of the temporary patio jurisdiction. A Transforming Edmonton story highlights some additional city support for shared streets and patios. July 13 marked the fifth week of the City Stream intake for the Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant. Demand remains high as this week the Local Economy team received 100 applications for grants in just over two hours. The team anticipates awarding approximately 68 grants of $1,000 each this week. The top 3 industries represented this week are: ● Accommodation/food services = 19 (21 last week) ● Retail trade = 11 (11 last week) ● Other services (nails/spa services, cleaning businesses, IT, and travel agencies) = 10 (30 last week) Downtown patios and shared streets The EERG has committed to a target of 30% of funding going to business owners who are part of an underrepresented group, and 30% of the funding going to businesses that support underrepresented groups. This week we again met these inclusivity targets with 51/68 (75%) grants going to business owners from underrepresented groups, and 24/68 (35%) grants going to businesses that support underrepresented groups. With respect to the Organization Grants stream for business associations the Local Economy team is beginning its first review next week of applications received to date.

Eight joint operations have been conducted with the Edmonton Police Service. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section (DOCS) provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. Edmonton Police Service numbers show that domestic violence files have been high for the past few weeks. Higher than normal categories for the most recent week include Family Disputes (non-criminal files); Disorder files (mostly Trouble with Person); and Assaults at 29 (equal to the weekly average for the past three years). INTERGOVERNMENTAL UPDATE: July 21 update TRANSIT: Edmonton Transit Service has distributed all of its free non-medical masks to citizens as part of the second phase of the Government of Alberta’s mask distribution plan. To encourage mask use and to thank riders for wearing masks, ETS shared a video on social media showcasing rider support for mask use. ETS began distributing 750,000 masks on July 15, 2020. This is in addition to the 500,000 that ETS distributed between June 15-19. Bus-only transit ridership for the week of July 12-18 was 520,769 weekday passenger boardings. Compared to last week (week 28) we observed 1% more ridership in this week (week 29) representing a 49% ridership recovery this week as compared to the same week in 2019.

This historic moment i s the result of collaboration between many City of Edmonton areas i ncluding ETS, Transit Fleet Maintenance, Fleet and Facilities Services, Corporate Procurement and Supply Services, and the electric bus supplier, Proterra. ETS’ 40 electric buses i s one of the single l argest purchases of electric buses i n Canadian history. To date, 21 electric buses have arrived i n Edmonton. The remaining 19 will begin arriving this fall. ETS will also be the first transit agency i n North America to have overhead chargers i nside transit facilities. Charging from above, rather than using floor-mounted plug-in chargers, greatly reduces the amount of floor space needed for charging. The buses will take roughly one to four hours to recharge, depending on the level of charge when they return to the garage. Proterra’s clean and quiet electric buses are winter compatible, have a range up to 350 kilometres on a single charge, and contribute to the City’s shift toward more sustainable transportation, a lower carbon footprint, and high-quality transit service for Edmontonians. Transit customers will enjoy a clean, quiet and smooth ride. Electric buses will be able to operate on almost every ETS route, and all buses come equipped with protective Operator shields. Electric buses are roughly 30% less expensive to service and maintain than current diesel buses, plus savings on the cost of fuel. Of the 21 buses that have arrived, 14 have an eye-catching promotional wrap on the back half of the bus that clearly indicates the bus is electric, while the other 7 buses are painted with ETS’ traditional blue and silver brand colours (see attached photo). Electric buses will be housed at the new Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage in northeast Edmonton, and Centennial Garage. Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage, once fully operational with electric bus infrastructure, will become the main hub. Training is in progress for bus operators, ETS inspectors, superintendents, instructors, fleet and facility staff, and first responders. .../2 -2- In 2015, ETS winter tested several electric buses to ensure the technology would be suitable for Edmonton’s cold weather, steep river valleys, and broad geographic transit area. The results were included in a 2016 feasibility study presented to City Council. The electric buses were also recently tested on steep Edmonton hills, using heavy sandbags to simulate full passengers loads.

CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH EXPRESSES CONCERN At today's provincial media availability , Alberta Chief Medical officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw expressed concern that current provincial acute care utilization is approaching the highest number of admissions on any single day that the province has had, which was a peak of 113 overall hospital admissions on April 30, and specific to ICU, 23 admissions on May 1. She stated that recent active cases have risen sharply. On July 9 Alberta had 590 active cases. Today there are nearly 1,300. Two weeks ago there were 7 Albertans in the ICU. Today that number has tripled. She attributed the rise in numbers to COVID-19 fatigue or that people have become tired with following rules and restrictions. EXPO SECURITY DROP THEIR GONCH FOR CHARITY The security teams at the EXPO Centre have collected over $1,500 in sock and underwear donations for the Bissell Centres' #Drop Your Gonch underwear donation drive for Emontonians experiencing homelessness. The campaign's goal is to obtain 7,000 new boxers, briefs, and bras between July 20 and 29. From the entire Expo Security Team (Peace Officers, Securiguard, Paladin, Commonwealth), the donations included three big shopping bags and two big Costco boxes of socks and underwear. In one day alone, they purchased 588 pairs of socks and 93 pairs of underwear.

The program is currently in negotiations for a 2021-2025 U-Pass Agreement and the current contract is undergoing adjustments in response to COVID-19. COVID-19 Impacts As post-secondary institutions moved to mostly online learning for the Spring/Summer term, participating U-Pass institutions expressed concerns about charging U-Pass fees when most students would not be travelling to and from campus. In anticipation of the upcoming Fall term, a Force Majeure amendment was drafted for the U-Pass Agreements; providing a formal process for non-collection of U-Pass fees. This amendment is in response to COVID-19 impacts on the U-Pass contract and is being reviewed by the U-Pass participants. Throughout the signing of a Letter of Understanding and development of the Force Majeure , the Students’ Associations had only expressed a need to ensure the non-collection of U-Pass fees for the Fall semester. ETS and the U-Pass municipal partners worked under this assumption and, as a result, U-Pass revenue was not included in the recent budget update shared with City Council on July 6, 2020. Some participating institutions have raised concerns that particular students will not have affordable access to transit. To address this concern, there are other ETS fare products as well as regional fare products that can support students in this situation. Options include the monthly ETS Youth Pass that has expanded age eligibility to those 24 and under, and the subsidized Ride Transit Program. Discounted books of tickets (10) are also an option for students who use transit less frequently .ETS and U-Pass participants continue to evaluate options beyond Fall 2020 that are operationally feasible. .../2 -2- 2021-2025 U-Pass Agreement Update The current U-Pass agreements expire August 31, 2021. The 2020-2021 U-Pass rate will be $180 per student per semester starting September 1, 2020. The U-Pass municipal proposal consists of these fees: ● 2021-2022: $180 (0% increase) ● 2022-2023: $185 (2.5% increase) ● 2023-2024: $190 (2.5% increase) ● 2024-2025: $195 (2.5% increase) As the 2021-2025 U-Pass agreement extends into the next multi-year operating budget, the above proposal attempts to anticipate future changes to user fees and other service cost impacts. U-Pass fees have stayed steady since 2016 ($170 per semester).

The instability has caused the failure of two timber retaining walls above the trail and severe cracking of the trail. The landslide area covers the width of the trail and the effects of ground movement are evident in areas both above and below the trail elevation. To address public safety concerns,the trail has been closed and signage has been installed in the area to warn users of the trail closure. Three detour options have been identified and will be posted on signage at major decision points approaching the trail for users to reference. Secure fencing will be installed the week of July 27, 2020, to prevent users from accessing the trail. The cautions and closures webpage currently identifies this as a temporary closure but will be updated to a long term closure when fencing is erected. Since this trail is a major connection between Capilano and Riverside, we expect there will be concerns expressed from the public about the closure. Next Steps Administration has begun to scope the project and an investigation and comparative assessment of alternatives for the site should be completed by the end of 2020. If remediation options are feasible and not cost prohibitive, detailed design will proceed in 2021 followed by construction. In addition to the most recent failure, the granular trail that loops behind the Riverside Golf Course (access at Rowland Rd and the Dawson Bridge) and connects to this newly closed trail is also closed due to erosion issues. Trail signage indicating this closure is already in place. Work is underway to redesign the Riverside Trail and construction is scheduled to start in 2021.

The condition of this portion of Gateway Boulevard requires renewal work to be completed, tentatively scheduled for construction in 2022. The following provides some background information on this work: ● Gateway Boulevard requires rehabilitation between University Avenue and 80 Avenue. ○ Rehabilitation means the roadway will undergo works such as curb and gutter repair, road repair (as required), asphalt resurfacing, and some sidewalk repair. In general, the configuration will remain as it is today, with condition-based improvements only where required. The decision to undertake rehabilitation is based on the condition of the roadway and associated infrastructure. ● Gateway Boulevard requires reconstruction between 80 Avenue and 82 Avenue. ○ Reconstruction is different from rehabilitation. Based on the poor condition of the infrastructure in this area, reconstruction includes full removal and replacement of road and sidewalk, which provides opportunities for improvements and enhancements to that section of the corridor. ● In 2019, the City completed an internal review and assessment of the vision for Gateway Boulevard between University Avenue and 82 Avenue, identifying opportunities to enhance the public realm along both sides of Gateway Boulevard. Both the rehabilitation and reconstruction are tentatively scheduled to take place in 2022. With a high level of visibility and interest in this key corridor, the City is considering active modes, business operations, and other factors as we plan for the upcoming reconstruction work between 80 Avenue and 82 Avenue. Many previous and current studies have been conducted 2 envisioning enhancements to the vibrancy and walkability of this area. Such studies include the Strathcona Area Redevelopment Plan, Strathcona Junction Area Redevelopment Plan (2012), Plan Whyte (2019), and the City Plan. These previous studies will inform the renewal plans for Gateway Boulevard and will be particularly important for the segment to be reconstructed between 80 Avenue and 82 Avenue. The key recommendation is to create or enhance pedestrian space on both sides of Gateway Boulevard. To support the development of the plans for Gateway Boulevard, stakeholder engagement is now in the early stages. Broader public engagement is not planned at this time. For the reconstruction area (80 Avenue to 82 Avenue), the Project team reached out to property owners via mail, hand delivered on July 13, requesting to discuss the upcoming work and gather their feedback and perspective on the plan. This was followed by phone calls, where possible, on July 17. The project team has advised property owners of the intention to also seek business tenant input, with a focus on operational considerations to inform the plan. To date, the project team has not received any feedback from the property owners. As a next step, the project team will be reaching out to business tenants to discuss the plan.

Organizers of Camp Pekiwewin have indicated that the site has been set up as a resource for those experiencing homelessness and as a protest against police brutality and violence. The group is made up of frontline outreach and housing workers, black, Indigenous and racialized community members, two2-Spirited/LGBTQ, and those who have lived experience with homelessness. Camp Pekiwewin organizers appear to be using an Indigenous leadership model of consensus decision making. A ceremonial fire has been lit and they have erected a tipi to reflect the connection to the Indigenous significance of the Rossdale site and the Fort Edmonton Cemetery and Traditional Burial Grounds directly south of the site. Indigenous culture seems to be a heavy influence on the operations of the space and activist response, in addition to the Black Lives Matter movement. Camp Pekiwewin has announced through social media that they are accepting community donations and distributing essential goods in response to the upcoming closure of the EXPO Centre. A list of demands to the City is publicly posted at the site and includes: ● divesting $39 million from Edmonton area law enforcement ● ending enforcement against homeless encampments ● eliminating bylaws that disproportionately impact individuals with no fixed address ● reinstating free transit ● increasing the provision of day shelter space and hygiene services Since July 24, at least 50 tents have been established at the site, many occupied by homeless individuals. Camp Pekiwewin organizers have set up hand sanitizer stations and portable toilets at the site. On July 28, Alberta Health Services attended the site and spoke to organizers. Alberta Health Services made several recommendations around garbage removal, increasing the frequency of emptying portable toilets, and general COVID cleaning guidelines and hygiene protocols. Alberta Health Services is also continuing to monitor the capacity of the site. The group is using community volunteers to try and establish site security. Additional calls for volunteers have been made via social media. Administration has established an internal team to develop a strategy to work towards a peaceful resolution with the group and to offer assistance with a coordinated delivery of ../2 - 2 - services to people experiencing homelessness. Administration has met with a representative of the leadership, of Camp Pekiwewin to start the conversation. The representative indicated that to ensure the health and safety of the individuals in the camp, they will not be adding additional capacity to the site and have capped the number of individuals using the camp. It is possible that additional encampments could emerge on other vacant lands in the area. The City and the Edmonton Police Service will not be taking any enforcement action against Camp Pekiwewin at this time. Closure of other unrelated active encampments across the city is being determined on a case-by-case basis using established operating procedures that prioritize responses based on the level of risk posed to individuals in the encampment and to the surrounding community. Also in response to the extreme heat, Park Rangers are distributing water bottles and coordinating welfare checks with outreach partners in known encampments across Edmonton.

The portal includes a business Face Covering Bylaw Toolkit . Business stakeholders were alerted to the Toolkit on Friday and local Business Improvement Areas, the Chamber of Commerce and business stakeholders were emailed supporting information this morning. The toolkit includes FAQs, messaging and printable posters. The Toolkit takes a high-level approach and a business-specific communications plan is being developed to answer questions received from owners and operators. The edmonton.ca/masks portal also has links for citizens to submit a complaint of face covering non-compliance or non-compliance with physical distancing. This weekend City enforcement officers patrolled the city with a focus on education outreach related to the new face covering requirements. No fines were issued. Areas of focus for patrols included downtown, Whyte Avenue, West Edmonton Mall, indoor park amenities, grocery stores, churches, transit facilities and recreation centres. The majority of citizens were compliant with the new bylaw when approached and educated by Peace Officers. A news release was issued this afternoon with additional mask compliance data from across the City during the long weekend. To help ensure inclusiveness, a subset of Relaunch Task Team members are developing a plan to support people who fall within one of the Face Covering Bylaw's exemption categories. More details will be shared in Thursday's update, however we are examining a card/button option that people within an exemption category may obtain from the City.

Maskfeedback@edmonton.ca may be used to submit questions and we will strive to respond as quickly as possible. Along with 311 data and what we are hearing through social media channels, we will use the questions and feedback we receive at this email to inform and update our communications materials as we begin to more fully understand the concerns of the public surrounding the bylaw. We ask that Councillors and their office staff use the email address but that you not share it publicly at this time. Instead, you are requested to direct people to edmonton.ca/masks for the most up to date information or to 311. EPL LIBRARY ON THE SQUARE: To continue to support the homeless and vulnerable communities, the City of Edmonton and the Edmonton Public Library (EPL) are co-leading an initiative to offer services and resources in an outdoor setting on Sir Winston Churchill Square. The activation is named EPL on the Square. While we expect the primary audience to be Edmontonians experiencing homelessness, EPL on the Square will be open to everyone. EPL will provide library services Tuesdays to Saturdays from 11 a.m. - 4 p.m. Alberta Health Services (AHS) has approved the site and EPL will begin initial programming as early as tomorrow, Wednesday, August 5. EPL has identified three spaces on the Square for library programming including: ● The Observation Deck: for technology-based programming ● ES3: The main centre portion of the Square for distributing single-use reading material and leading classes such as music circles, adult book clubs and other programming suitable to physically distanced interactions. EPL’s three Outreach Workers will also work to support the needs of customers and connect them to community services. ● East Formal Garden: to be used as a leisure space with games and shaded areas for reading. Extra picnic tables to be provided by the City. In addition to library service, downtow","e, downtown community partners will also offer co-located activities and services, including: two of the City’s Community Navigators will provide resources on financial empowerment; Boyle Street will join EPL and engage with customers; Bissell Centre will send their housing workers on Wednesdays; and Homeward Trust will have their Coordinated Access Team to connect customers to other community services. Library programing opens at Churchill Square EPL will track several metrics during the activation including: the number of non-circulating reading materials distributed; number of computer sessions and length/total time of sessions; attendees for classes; number of service referrals and agencies worked with (including total hours they provide service on the Square); count of participants; and incident reports, as required and for reporting purposes The Square will not be entirely closed off and pedestrians will continue to be able to pass through the Square with the exception of The Observation Deck. Barricades/fencing will be used to direct customer movement. A large number of umbrellas on site may be used to provide shade within the centre portion of the square and tents are available to allow programming to adjust with weather conditions. SHELTERS: On Friday, additional funding was announced by the Government of Alberta for Hope Mission and Mustard Seed to provide 24/7 services. Hope Mission is requesting to put up a temporary structure beside their home location. This would allow them to offer 24/7 services at their usual location. This will require a temporary change of zoning or a GOA public health notice. We are connecting Hope Mission to the Development Services Client Liaison Unit to assist. The EXPO Centre’s last day of operation was Friday, July 31. All went smoothly over the long weekend at EXPO with many community members aware that the Day Drop In services were ending on July 31.

The camp was established, in part, as a response to the closure of the EXPO Centre that had been providing day services for many experiencing homelessness and as a result of elements of protest regarding defunding the police. The City’s first priority is public safety. Immediate closure of the camp without providing the support needed for vulnerable people at this site could result in significant and unexpected impacts on the health and safety of these individuals and the surrounding community. However, Administration has developed a set of triggers for immediate closure which have been shared with camp organizers. Some of the triggers that would result in immediate closure by the City includes an outbreak of COVID-19, violence in the camp, or other public safety risks. Administration has established an internal team to continue dialogue with the organizers and develop a strategy to work towards a peaceful resolution with the group. Administration is also working with Homeward Trust to provide those who are experiencing homelessness in Camp Pekiwewin with a pathway to secure permanent housing. Administration has provided the camp with basic necessities for cleanliness, sanitation, and COVID-19 prevention, such as face coverings (4,000 disposable masks) and is working to provide on-site hand washing stations and waste collection.

The development of the exemption card program was in support of that need and based on trust. Unfortunately, we have information that indicates some individuals who do not have legitimate exemptions have obtained a card. As such, t he City of Edmonton has stopped distributing face covering / mask exemption cards at its recreation facility locations, as of 3:00 p.m. today. We are reassessing the program and distribution mechanisms for those with a legitimate exemption and who may want a card but were unable to pick one up in person. We trust that those with legitimate exemptions have been able to obtain a card up to this point. At this time, we are unable to say when this alternate distribution will be in place and when cards will be available again.

For these reasons, the risk of infection to transit riders is extremely low. ● We continue to use a new disinfecting agent applied daily with an electrostatic sprayer to all ETS vehicles before they go into service, at transit centres and LRT stations. ● We added disinfecting spray and cloths to boardrooms, photocopy rooms, and lounges at all transit garages. ● Operators have also been asked to take a self-assessment prior to commencing each shift, before they come to work. ● Operators are supplied with hand sanitizer and wipes to clean their operator compartment and have been given clear information on the importance of hand hygiene throughout their shift. ● Wearing a mask or face covering is required on transit. ● It is mandatory for conventional and LRT Operators to wear masks or face coverings when leaving the shielded area on the bus or LRT cab to go into any public area. Approach: ETS leadership has contacted any employees who may have come in contact with equipment shared with the affected employee during the period in question, and communicated with the employees at Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. ETS has also contacted Amalgamated Transit Union Local 569. The City will follow the advice and recommendations of AHS, including if public notification is necessary as a precautionary measure. Communications will work with ETS to ensure any affected staff have the information they need and are supported, while protecting the employee’s privacy. Background: The Operator was working out of Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. 17(1) Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing Operators continue to use buses with shields to create a physical barrier between themselves and passengers.

The Prime Minister has also prorogued the current parliamentary session and announced a date for a Speech from the Throne. See here for the Prime Minister’s News Release . Below is a summary of these federal changes. Cabinet Shuffle Bill Morneau has resigned as Minister of Finance. He has also resigned his seat as Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre. He has said he will be pursuing an opportunity as Secretary General for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Morneau was first elected to the House of Commons in the 2015 federal election and has served as the Minister of Finance since the Liberals were elected to office. Chrystia Freeland has been appointed Minister of Finance . She also retains her role as Deputy Prime Minister. She has been the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, playing a key role in negotiations with provincial Premiers and has had strong relationships with Mayors of the country’s big cities. Freeland is the first female Finance Minister in Canadian history. Dominic LeBlanc has been appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs . This is a post he held previously prior to last fall’s federal election, so it is a file he is familiar with and he has established relationships with provincial and municipal leaders. He also retains a related role as President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada. Parliament Prorogued; Throne Speech scheduled for September 23 The House of Commons had been scheduled to meet on a biweekly basis for the duration of summer and then on a daily basis starting September 21. But today the Prime Minister announced that this session of the House of Commons had been prorogued. This also means that parliamentary committees that investigate government bills and actions will not be meeting. The Prime Minister also announced today that Parliament would resume sitting on September 23 with a Speech from the Throne. That’s the same week Parliament was originally scheduled to resume daily sittings. The Prime Minister spoke of that speech being an outline of his government’s “long term recovery plan for a stronger and more resilient Canada,” a plan which he said would be subject to a confidence vote in Parliament. Impact on the City of Edmonton These federal changes mean a slight shift in the advocacy landscape for the City. The federal budget is usually tabled in the first quarter of the calendar year, so the City typically submits its annual federal budget submission early in the new year. In order to meet the new federal fiscal and legislative calendar, Council will need to make decisions in the next couple of weeks around the City’s fiscal and policy priorities that could be presented to the federal government. Council will also have a renewed opportunity to enhance the already positive relationships with Chrystia Freeland and Dominic LeBlanc. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects, as well as the “double shock” effects of the fall in oil prices, Edmonton is experiencing a period of volatility and uncertainty in real estate markets. This has significant implications for the City’s property assessment and taxation processes, summarized below. Lack of Market Information Provincial legislation requires estimates to be made at the valuation date of July 1, 2020; three months after the beginning of the economic shutdown. However, real estate transactions have significantly slowed since the COVID-19 pandemic began, particularly in the non-residential market. Although the residential market shows signs of reinvigoration, data prior to the valuation date is lacking. A June 2020 to June 2019 comparison indicates sales transactions down by 47% overall, and as much as 83% in some non residential inventories. Consequently, in some areas there is a lack of market evidence to clearly determine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on real estate values. Although logically these effects exist, the lack of sales data will make valuation estimates extremely difficult. Validity of Existing Market Information Market information gathered before the COVID-19 pandemic may be unrepresentative of the real estate market at the valuation date. COVID economic effects will not be reflected in sales prices negotiated before the pandemic. Pre-pandemic transactions will be indicative of a market equilibrium that has shifted, and will need to be either significantly adjusted or discounted entirely. Post-COVID transactions will need significant vetting to ensure the absence of duress conditions and that each meets the definition of a valid transaction. Second Round of s.295 Requests for Information Additional data is required to capture the impacts of the COVID pandemic, however, as a result of the slowdown in real estate activity, such data is not easily collected. The Assessment and Taxation Branch has issued a second round of Requests For Information (MGA s.295 RFIs) to non-residential property owners seeking information related specifically to COVID-19 economic impacts. From these, the branch hopes to collect enough information to understand what effects may exist. Responses to date have been limited, however. Short-Term Uncertainty and Inequity Given limited sales evidence available, a small number of erratic sales may prove overly influential in analysis and may result in value conclusions that are not representative of true market value. Redistributive effects of taxation based on indicators of a market not in equilibrium could result in uncertainty and inequity, creating financial risks for businesses, property owners, and the City. Assessment Review Board (ARB) The Assessment Review Boards are also impacted by the COVID-19 situation. Review board panels have been given a Ministerial extension to render notice of decisions for 2020, which will limit assessors’ ability to consider such decisions for the 2021 Tax Year assessment. ARBs have delayed the scheduling of hearings due to COVID-19 and are limited in the number of appeals they are able to hold virtually. Additionally, a large increase in appeal volume is expected for the 2021 Tax Year, owing both to the volatility of the market and to financial difficulties facing property owners. The ARB will experience difficulties in scheduling and hearing cases throughout 2021. Equalized Assessment The Assessment and Taxation Branch has additional concerns about the COVID economic effects on the provincial equalization process. Under the current equalized assessment process, which determines each municipality’s share of the Province’s Education Tax levy, overall ratios may be unduly weighted towards pre-COVID markets. Assessment-to-sale ratios may be skewed, especially if one municipality has indicators that include pandemic effects, while another does not. There is potential for the equalized assessment to be compromised, since the current process fails to differentiate between two dissimilar economic circumstances. Of particular concern is the quantity and validity of value indicators going into the equalized calculation in the non-residential tax class. Mitigation Strategies and Provincial Outreach: In a proactive attempt to address the property valua","tion challenges presented by 2020’s extraordinary circumstances, the City of Edmonton’s Assessment and Taxation branch met with the City Assessors’ Group to discuss COVID-19’s effects on real estate 1 markets. Discussions initially focused on the effects of COVID and Alberta’s economic downturn on assessment and valuation, before turning to mitigative strategies. The group discussed two 1 The City Assessors Group is made up of assessors from the City of Airdrie, City of Beaumont, City of Brooks, City of Calgary, City of Camrose, City of Chestermere, City of Cold Lake, City of Edmonton, City of Fort Saskatchewan, City of Grande Prairie, City of Lacombe, City of Leduc, City of Lethbridge, City of Lloydminster, City of Medicine Hat, City of Red Deer, City of Spruce Grove, City of St. Albert, City of Wetaskiwin, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, and Strathcona County. strategies which are outlined below. The decision with the group was to approach the province with strategy one. Strategy One : Request the province extend the roll declaration deadline and amend audit and equalization processes In a submission to the province, and at a subsequent meeting with representatives of the Assessment Services Branch of Municipal Affairs, the City Assessors’ Group requested that the province’s assessment quality standards (which underpin the equalization process) be updated to reflect current market realities. As yet, Municipal Affairs has not communicated any changes to the process and seems disinclined to alter the current system in any formalized way. The Ministry has suggested municipalities work with their Assessment Auditors to reach an agreement on equalization ratios. Strategy Two : “Roll Over” the 2020 Tax Year Assessment The City Assessor’s Group also considered Edmonton’s proposal to advocate for a “roll over” of the previous year’s assessment values. Municipalities would perform a reassessment of all property using July 1, 2019 as the valuation date for 2021 Tax Year only; effectively “rolling over” the 2020 Tax Year assessment roll. While having benefits for predictability, stability and ease of administration, there would be risks to the perception of fairness, and erosion of best practices using current market data. Ultimately, the Assessor’s Group did not move forward with this strategy. Administration continues to work with its partners in other municipalities, the Government of Alberta, and other provincial assessment authorities, to determine the best way to address the COVID-19 impact on the property tax assessment process. Please let me know if you would like any further information related to the above. __________________________________________ Mary Persson Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer Financial and Corporate Services Department","Yes","2020-07-06T00:00:00.000",,"City Council"

Key Messages: ● Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and the public. ● The City of Edmonton has a detailed and comprehensive process for addressing positive COVID-19 cases among its workforce and is positioned to take an active and rapid response for assessing and managing risk internally and to the public. ● We can confirm there was a positive case at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre (EWMC). ● Based on our assessment the risk to the public was low. ● We have a duty to protect the privacy of each City employee, and can not share specific information. Right now, this employee needs our support and compassion. 17(1) Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing ● We are currently working with AHS to determine next steps and will follow their advice and recommendations, including if public notification is necessary as a precautionary measure. Public Safety ● It is safe for the public to continue to use the Edmonton Waste Management Centre. Based on our assessment the risk to the public was low. Should AHS determine the risk to be otherwise, a public communications strategy will be developed and delivered. ● We continue to have pre-screen and physical distancing policies in place that staff are expected to follow, in addition to frequent wipe down and sanitizing of all public and staff high touch surfaces. ● Additionally, we have been bringing in a professional cleaning company to thoroughly clean and sanitize on a weekly basis on top of our daily janitorial services. ● We have not been handling cash at the EWMC and instead, use a machine to accept payment. We encourage customers to use tap and disinfect the machine after each use. ● All staff are required to take a self assessment prior to commencing each shift, before they come to work. ● All staff are supplied with hand sanitizer and wipes to clean their work spaces, and have been given clear information on the importance of hand hygiene throughout their shifts. Approach: Waste Services leadership has contacted any employees who may have come in contact with the affected employee during the period in question, and communicated with employees at the Edmonton Waste Management Centre. The City will work with AHS to determine next steps and will follow their advice and recommendations, including if public notification is necessary as a precautionary measure. Communications will work with Waste Services to ensure any affected staff have the information they need and are supported, while protecting the employee’s privacy.

Government of Alberta Cabinet Shuffle Premier Jason Kenney announced a shuffle of some key cabinet ministers. See government news release for more details . Kaycee Madu moves from Municipal Affairs to Justice and Solicitor General . In this new role, Madu will continue to implement reforms in the Justice department, particularly a crack down on property crime and completion of the statutory review of the Police Act. He will also take a lead role in implementing the Fair Deal Panel recommendations and in court challenges of federal legislation such as the carbon tax. The Premier highlighted that Madu is the first black Canadian to be a Minister of Justice in Canada. Tracy Allard , MLA for Grande Prairie, replaces Kaycee Madu as Minister of Municipal Affairs and is a new member of the cabinet. The Premier highlighted her “real world business experience and entrepreneurial spirit.” The Premier says her role will include “challenging municipal governments to stop increasing taxes and red tape.” She is tasked with publishing a fiscal report card for municipalities, that will include a comparison of Alberta municipalities to those in other provinces. Doug Schweitzer moves from Justice and Solicitor General to a newly named ministry of Jobs, Economy, and innovation . This ministry replaces (renames) the Economic Development, Trade and Tourism ministry, and means that Tanya Fir loses that cabinet position. Schweitzer will take a lead role in coordinating Alberta’s Economic Recovery Plan. The Premier also announced a senior staff change in the Premier’s Office . Principal Secretary, Harold Anglin, is leaving this position to pursue an opportunity at Oxford University. He is replaced by Lawrence Kaumeyer, who worked for the Ralph Klein government at one time. First Quarter Fiscal and Economic Update The cabinet shuffle is the first of two major announcements from the Government of Alberta this week. On Thursday, August 27, the government will be releasing the 2020-21 first quarter fiscal and economic update. The legislature will be recalled for that one day for a special debate on the first quarter fiscal reality. The next session of the legislature is scheduled to resume sitting on October 26, 2020. Federal Update: New Leader for the Conservative Party of Canada Erin O’Toole was elected Sunday as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) to replace Andrew Scheer. (See his platform that he pitched to CPC members.) O’Toole gave his first media briefing today, repeating his messaging from his victory speech Sunday night. He spoke of an initial meeting he had with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau where he was briefed on the Liberal government’s plans to unveil an “economic rebuilding plan” (O’Toole’s words) as part of the Speech from the Throne on September 23. O’Toole says he will be announcing his shadow cabinet soon, prior to the next session of Parliament. Impact on the City of Edmonton These provincial (and federal) changes mean a shift in the advocacy landscape for the City. The Municipal Affairs Ministry is a significant player for our city and all municipalities. Council will need to seek opportunities to build a relationship with the new minister Tracy Allard. Kaycee Madu, as the only UCP MLA in Edmonton, remains Edmonton’s only voice at the cabinet table, so he continues to play an important role for the city. The first quarter fiscal update and UCP government response to it will be important to understand in considering the City’s future provincial advocacy approach and priorities. In terms of the federal landscape, it remains to be seen to what extent Erin O’Toole will shift the Conservative Party positions and approaches from Andrew Scheer’s three years as leader. Given his role as leader of the opposition, it will be important for Council to find opportunities to share Edmonton’s story and priorities with O’Toole. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you. CO/jh c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk",,"No",,,

EDMONTON COVID-19 STATUS: The City of Edmonton remains on the Alberta Health Services Watch List with an Active Case Rate (ACR) of 53.5 per 100,000 in the last 24 hours, with five Edmonton zones above the 50 per 100,000 ACR Watch List benchmark (Castle Downs 95, Eastwood 55.1, Edmonton NE 102.4, Northgate 146.8, Abbotsfield 75.7). A map of the affected Alberta Health Services local geographic areas is available here. Administration will provide an update to the Emergency Advisory Committee this Thursday on the latest data, key indicators, actions and planning relative to COVID-19 outbreaks across the city. A Transforming Edmonton article this week shared advice from Alberta Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Deena Hinshaw to remind Edmontonians of steps they can take to reduce the risk of spreading or contracting COVID-19 at social gatherings.

To date no tickets have been issued. Overall, Edmontonians are being very compliant when approached and engaged by City enforcement officers and officers are doing their best to help as much as possible. For example, during a recent patrol, a municipal enforcement officer was monitoring a business for compliance with the mask bylaw when they saw a person being turned away from the business by a security guard. The officer intervened and had a conversation with the citizen who was upset and walking back to their vehicle. The citizen explained why they did not have a mask and the officer listened and was able to calm the individual down enough to give them a mask and walk them back to the business so they could finish their shopping. Based on enforcement officer patrol data, compliance with the temporary face coverings bylaw remains high. The vehicle for hire compliance rate is 86%, Transit compliance is 92% (87% LRT / 97% bus), public space compliance is 98% and recreation facilities compliance is 98%. MANDATORY MASKS BY MUNICIPALITY Recently the Convenience Industry Council of Canada released an updated Mandatory Mask Requirements document outlining requirements as they apply to business owners in municipalities right across Canada. This document includes overviews of the requirements for businesses in Edmonton, Calgary, Canmore and Banff along with links to various bylaws. LOCAL ECONOMY: The One-on-One Support Program has received 40 new inquiries in August with 97 active/open inquiries. The Local Economy Team received six new patio registrations this week, bringing the total to 103 temporary patios and outdoor retail spaces. Locations include: 28 downtown, 27 in Old Strathcona, seven on Alberta Avenue, six on 124 Street, two at Kingsway, one in the French Quarter, one in Northwest Industrial, and the remaining 31 are located outside of BIAs. August 17 is the tenth week of the Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant Program intake for the Individual Business Grants City Stream and the Local Economy Team received 33 applications. We anticipate awarding 22 grants of $1,000 each this week and 21 of the 22 approved applications were from business owners from underrepresented groups (95%), while four out of the 22 applications were for businesses that said that they served underrepresented populations (18%). EDMONTON VALLEY ZOO: For the week of August 16 - 22 the Edmonton Valley Zoo saw 8,002 reservations filled of 9,800 available for a fill rate of 82%. Since opening, 73,109 reservations","ations have been filled of 94,290 available (78%). To date, 1,921 visitor surveys have been completed with an overall satisfaction rating of 86% and a 90% satisfaction rating for COVID-19 safety measures. Ten days have sold out since reopening. OUTDOOR FITNESS PROGRAM: For the week of August 16 - 22 City outdoor fitness programs saw 695 of 1,930 available bookings filled. Of the 92 client surveys completed, there was a 99% overall satisfaction rating, 95% satisfaction with COVID-19 safety measures and 93% of those surveyed planned to return for more classes. RENTAL BOOKINGS: For the week of August 16 - 22 the City saw 2,312 sports fields bookings, 44 picnic site bookings, and 1,213 arena bookings. RECREATION/LEISURE CENTRE BOOKINGS: For the week of August 16 - 22 the City saw the following Recreation/Leisure Centre bookings: ● Terwillegar: 3,705 fitness centre reservations of 5,600 available with 315/477 court bookings ● Meadows: 4,781 fitness centre reservations of 5,600 available with 398/672 court bookings ● Clareview: 3,171 fitness centre reservations of 5,600 available with 299/448 court bookings ● Commonwealth: 2,179 fitness centre reservations of 5,600 available with 35/264 court bookings ● Kinsmen: 1,654 fitness centre reservations of 3,920 available with 153/340 court bookings Summer at the zoo remains very popular OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION ENCAMPMENTS: From August 18 - 24, the Encampment Response Team received 109 calls for service from 311 and other internal agencies. 28 occupied or vacant encampments were cleaned of debris by City Operations and another 28 were referred to City Operations for removal. A remaining 78 encampment files require investigation and 39 known camps are currently being monitored. There have been 122 encampment files closed. To date in 2020, we have received 2,949 calls for service with 2,847 encampment files investigated and closed. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. Of note is that family violence occurrences have been occurring fairly consistently around 20% more in 2020 than the prior year. Training and dialogue for and between family violence prevention service providers has been a focus in Edmonton over the past few months. Some highlights of this activity include: ● Healthy Aging Collaborative Online Resources & Education (CORE) held its first Elder Abuse Discussion on August 13, 2020, to develop strategies to address elder abuse in the least intrusive, but most effective way. Representatives of the Seniors Protection Partnership participated in this discussion. ● Community Initiatives Against Family Violence (CIAFV) has had three major presentations over the summer ranging from Introduction to Brain Injury and Domestic Violence (64 participants), Emergency Protection Orders (69 participants) and Legal GPS (22 participants) ● The Today Centre has provided 14 workshops across our community to 400 participants. Comparison to 2019 for the same time frame saw 12 workshops to 315 participants. It’s Time social media (CoE Gender Based Violence & Sexual Assault Prevention Initiative) reaches approximately 100,000 people per month. Engagement rates have levelled out since the spring, but engagement is still holding steady. There is often a dip in engagement in July and August, but this year that dip is smaller than usual, and engagement is up by approximately 15% from this time in 2019. Correction: Last week’s Domestic Violence update contained an incorrect link to older outdated data. Please see this week's link above for updated information up to week 33. TRANSIT: Bus-only transit ridership for the week of August 16 - 22 was 555,041 weekday passenger boardings. Compared to last week we observed 1.2% more ridership. This represents a 53% ridership recovery this week as compared to the same week in 2019. Comparative transit data weeks 21-34 COVID-19 IN ALBERTA","No",,,

Workforce reductions will factor into our budget adjustment discussions with Council in November. Administration will present budget recommendations - including options for workforce reductions - that will inform Council’s decisions. In an effort to find some of these workforce efficiencies, the City is once again offering eligible employees the option to voluntarily retire or resign their positions with the City of Edmonton. We will be launching this Program to management and out-of-scope employees beginning October 19. The City worked with all of its union partners to offer this program to all City employees. However, CSU 52 is the only confirmed union considering this program for their membership. CSU 52 has called a special meeting with its members on October 22 to discuss the City’s proposed Workforce Transition Program Letter of Understanding (LOU).

We appreciate parents may have questions about the health and safety of their children when on transit and we want to reassure them that the safety of our customers and staff remains our top priority as transit service resumes. ETS has worked throughout the summer with the School Boards to plan for the return to school. ETS has provided messaging and information on the resumption of school routes to provide to parents through internal channels. School routes this fall have not changed substantially from fall 2019, however ETS has adjusted the times of School Special bus routes to accommodate school schedules. ETS analysed boarding data from school routes from the fall 2019 and does not anticipate many cases of crowded school routes. We will be closely monitoring the passenger loads on our school service throughout September using our School Inspectors and ridership data. As of August 1, 2020, wearing a mask or face covering is mandatory indoors in the publicly accessible areas of all City-owned and operated buildings, facilities, amenities and attractions, including transit, transit centres and LRT platforms. Compliance on ETS will continue to be monitored on school routes. The City will continue to focus on educating all passengers, including students, on the importance of wearing a mask or face covering, as well as the continued importance of following all Alberta Health Services guidelines. ETS will maintain a number of enhanced safety measures to respond to COVID-19 including an enhanced cleaning protocol and use of a disinfecting agent applied daily with an electrostatic sprayer to all ETS vehicles before they go into service at transit centres and LRT stations. In addition, ETS will continue to deploy buses with Operator shields to provide a safety barrier between the Operator and passengers. .../2 -2- Earlier this month, ETS updated Edmonton Public and Catholic School Boards on School Special bus routes and enhanced safety measures on transit, including mandatory masks/face coverings, physical distancing and enhanced cleaning/disinfecting procedures.

A news release was also issued with additional information. CAMP PEKIWEWIN There are currently approximately 170 tents at Camp Pekiwewin (Peck-ie-he-win) . The number of occupants has been decreasing slightly and not all tents are occupied. Some additional tents have been erected by staff from social agencies as they provide on-site services. Homeward Trust, Bissell, and Boyle Street, along with Alberta Health Services, are working with camp organizers to build ongoing positive connections. The priority is to establish safety and wellbeing for people experiencing homelessness at the site while connecting them to services and supports towards a pathway to housing. An initial safety inspection has been conducted by AHS. The site was found to be tidy but some additional recommendations for safety were identified and enacted by camp organizers. Moving forward, AHS, working jointly with the City’s Workforce Safety and Employee Health team, will conduct weekly inspections. AHS has not yet provided an update on potential COVID-19 testing at the camp. Administration is continuing with community engagement in the area surrounding the camp.

NET was able to go door to door and provide the community with the City’s action plan, 24/7 crisis diversion information and a document that encourages positive interactions. The NET team has followed up with some residents that were initially missed and have left additional packages at apartment buildings that were not accessible at the time. NET is currently completing the scan and analysis report and will be providing recommendations to support communities that have social disorder and crime concerns. Information has been shared with the Rossdale Community League regarding the City’s action plan and measures taken to mitigate impact. Enforcement action is not currently recommended to address the establishment of Camp Pekiwewin. Significant public safety risks that would warrant a change to this approach have not yet emerged. There have been some minor incidents in and around the Rossdale area and Administration is working with the community and the camp organizers to address and lessen these incidents. The City has engaged the camp organizers in developing a collaborative approach to ending the encampment. At this time no date has been set for the closure of the camp and Administration and camp organizers are working towards a set of conditions to be met first before establishing a target date. Those conditions include consideration towards service provision for people experiencing homelessness, access to hygiene services and providing further connections to existing social agencies. The camp organizers have stated they expect to publish a new list of “demands” on Friday on a new website. As discussions are ongoing, no further details are currently available. COVID-19 ACTIVE CASE RATES Edmonton remains on the Government of Alberta Watch List with an overall active case rate of 51.5 per 100,000 and five zones within the city are on Watch status. (Castle Downs 90.7, Eastwood 60.6, Edmonton NE 109.1, Northgate 128.6, and Abbotsfield 75.7). Cases by geographical area can be viewed on the City’s COVID-19 Dashboard under the AHS Local Geographic Areas tab. HANDLING OF CASH The Government of Alberta Guidance for Retail Business suggests that businesses take precautions at the point of sale to reduc","t of sale to reduce possible COVID-19 transmission, use contactless payment, and avoid cash payments where possible. Concerned businesses or employees may encourage tap payment over PIN pad use or money exchange. They may also limit workers' handling of credit, debit and loyalty cards by allowing customers to scan their own cards. Cash use remains important for vulnerable people However, the Bank of Canada is reminding retailers that not everyone may have access to electronic payment options and cash may be their only available option. The Bank of Canada and the Government of Canada advise businesses to continue to accept cash payments from customers if possible so that Canadians will continue to have access to needed goods and services. Refusing cash purchases outright may put an undue burden on those who depend on cash and have limited payment options. The risks posed from handling cash are similar to those posed by touching other common surfaces like doorknobs, kitchen counters and handrails and similar hand hygiene and public health guidelines should be followed. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION EMPLOYEE ISOLATION/WORK FROM HOME DATA The data on the number of employees working from home or in self isolation has been updated at edmonton.ca ; 28% of the City's employees are working from home.

The winter weather that Edmonton experiences has evolved, creating challenges that have rarely occurred in the past. The recommendations for the 2020/21 winter season address these challenges in order to provide a more service-driven experience for residents. Specifically, ongoing residential road maintenance between snow events will reduce windrows and improve residential streets and a city-wide parking ban will allow crews to clear roads more quickly. Questions Raised During the August 17, 2020 Council Meeting Private Contract Work Paid for by the City The total cost for all private contracts for the 2019/20 winter season is $16,887,558, which represents 27.0% of the total 2019/20 winter season budget for snow and ice control. These costs are broken out into two categories: ● Hired equipment responds to a call for support in a snow event or for cul-de-sac clearing. It includes equipment and operators. The total cost for hired equipment for the 2019/20 winter season is $11,803,666. This represents 18.8% of the total 2019/20 winter season budget for the Snow and Ice Control program. Hired Equipment costs are further broken down as follows ○ Active Pathways - $3,817 (0.03%) ○ Roadways - $11,799,849 (99.97%) ● General contract work includes all contractors that work for the City on an ongoing basis, either alongside City staff or with defined responsibilities. The total cost for general contract work for the 2019/20 winter season is $5,083,892. This represents 8.1% of the total 2019/20 Snow and Ice Control program budget. General contract costs are further broken down as follows: ○ Active Pathways - $5,015,888 (98.66%) ○ Roadways - $68,004 (1.34%) .../2 -2- Portable Signs Administration understands that portable, non-digital signs can be an effective communication tool for maintenance activities on the road network. In our research, residents have expressed their appreciation for the signage used for the spring sweep program (both the large plywood signs at neighbourhood entrances/intersections, as well as the smaller metal “A” frame no parking signs). Implementing the same approach for a parking ban presents its own set of challenges with the winter season, however, as part of the program design for the parking ban, Administration is looking at creative solutions for physical signage that balances cost and resource impacts, while still providing residents with the communication they need.

Usage Data of Cyclists and Pedestrians on Shared-use Paths The table below outlines the cyclist and pedestrian volumes on shared-use paths and designated pedestrian and bike lanes in 2020, and the percent change day-over-day compared to 2019, averaged monthly. Generally, pedestrian and cyclist volumes have decreased within downtown and increased outside downtown, likely due to activity in downtown decreasing overall as a result of COVID-19. Pedestrian and cyclist counts are heavily influenced by rainfall, weather conditions and temperatures.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. The City of Edmonton is proud to be highlighting the work of The Today Centre and the United Way of the Capital Region through the Cut It Out program. Cut It Out is a program specifically designed for salon professionals to learn how to recognize, respond, and refer clients who may be experiencing family violence to the appropriate agencies or support. In our commitment to emphasizing the role of bystanders in domestic violence prevention, the City will be mailing out information booklets that explain this program and information on further training to 180 hair salons and barber shops in the city. The mental health concerns resulting from domestic and family violence demands innovative approaches to support the psychological burden and healthcare needs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this, the Westview Primary Care Network in Edmonton and the University of Alberta Department of Psychiatry are exploring the implementation of potential virtual care interventions in reaching individuals and families at risk of domestic violence during the pandemic. The team has recently completed a rapid review of the evidence examining the application and feasibility of a range of virtual care interventions (e.g. telehealth, mobile health apps, videoconferencing, e-mental health programs) within primary care and community settings in addressing domestic violence. A preliminary knowledge synthesis report can be found on the COVID-19 and Mental Health Initiative website covid19mentalhealthresearch.ca . The research team is currently consulting with community stakeholders and will also be engaging with those with lived experience.

The protesters seek to host a demonstration and set up approximately 20 tents at the park with an Elder present to smudge and start a sacred fire. The organizer is not affiliated with Camp Pekiwewin and has issued a separate list of reasons for demonstrating on Facebook. The organizer of the demonstration has notified EPS and the Old Strathcona Business Association of their plan. City of Edmonton Position: When the City dismantles illegal camps, it does so carefully and compassionately. Working with outreach workers and peace officers, our aim is to be respectful of people and property. In notifying EPS and the surrounding businesses community of this event, the organizer has expressed their desire for the demonstration to be temporary (4 to 7 days) and to reduce impacts to the community. City Administration recognizes this gesture of good faith and will allow the event to proceed with the understanding the demonstration will end upon a mutually agreed upon date in the coming week. Administration will communicate with the camp organizer through their existing relationship with EPS to coordinate a fixed end date and time for the demonstration (either September 8th or 9th at noon). As of the agreed upon closure time, Peace Officers and EPS will seek voluntary compliance from the demonstration participants to vacate the park and remove any temporary structures they have erected. This demonstration is distinct from Camp Pekiwewin due to its smaller size, shorter duration, and the efforts of the organizers to notify EPS and the surrounding community in advance. Based on these characteristics, the City is confident that the closure of the demonstration will be expedited quickly on the agreed upon date and with reduced risks for conflict or harm to the health and safety of participants and the surrounding community. Key Messages: The Demonstration Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing ● The City respects the protesters’ Freedoms of Expression and Peaceful Assembly as guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. ● Any temporary structures that are erected during the demonstration will need to be removed as of the closure date and time to be agreed upon by the City and the organizers of the demonstration. ● In the event that any temporary structures remain on the site after the agreed upon end date, Peace Officers and EPS will seek voluntary compliance to maintain safety and follow an orderly process to remove the structures. Encampment Response Team ● The City routinely schedules closures and clean-ups of encampments on public land. The closure and clean-up of encampments is prioritized based on the level of risk posed to individuals in the encampment and the surrounding community. ● The City’s Encampment Response Team works in partnership with Homeward Trust, Boyle Street Community Services and Bissell Centre to connect individuals in encampments with supports and pathways to housing. ● City of Edmonton staff and community partners continue to conduct outreach into encampments and have developed a citywide COVID-19 Homeless Response Map which allows the City and partners to: ○ Map and track people who are homeless and who are sleeping outdoors in all areas of the city. ○ Conduct wellness checks by identifying who needs basic services such as food, healthcare, etc. ○ Identify individuals who may be showing symptoms of COVID-19 and connect them to assessment and treatment. ● The established process for the City’s response to encampments on public land is described in detail at edmonton.ca/homelessness Longer Term Housing Solutions ● Edmonton is critically and urgently short of supportive housing for people who have experienced homelessness and need help to find and maintain housing. The City’s Affordable Housing Investment Plan calls for 600 units of supportive housing by 2022 and a further 300 units by 2024. The City of Edmonton continues to encourage the Government of Alberta to provide operational support for supportive housing. ● Emergency shelters that serve individuals experiencing chronic homelessness are operating in different locations across the city and are not at capacity. Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing","Issue Briefing Approach : Communications will respond to media inquiries as they arise with the key messages listed above. Should it be required, a statement will be issued from the Interim City Manager to provide additional clarity on the City’s approach to protest encampments (including Camp Pekiwewin) and encampment closure and cleanup. Background: The organizer has announced the following reasons for their demonstration, which have been included below verbatim: ● Easy access fentanyl test kits, Naloxone and modern harm reduction supplies. ● Housing. Immediate and limited personal information. No cracks to fall between. No one left behind. ● Safe supply and safe sites ● Admit that foster care is the new residential school. ● Continuing support for foster kids who’ve aged out of the system ● Full ongoing support for former foster kids that were physically, sexually or emotionally abused during foster care. ● Old Strathcona outreach and drop in centre specifically for women, girls and LGBTQ2 people at high risk. To avoid MMIP ● Moonlighting is a reality ● Police and Peace Officer abuse and destruction of shelters, food and belongings ● Immediate Rehab. 2 to 3 month wait can be a death sentence ● Old hotel, office, remand (with caveat) living spaces, Municipal Airport tiny houses ● Acknowledgement of the following questions and points: Why is it that First Nations are only 5.39% population in Edmonton but the First Nations prison population in Alberta is 54%? The street population from foster care and residential schools is uncountable… So is the number of homeless and prison population that come from the foster care program ● Lift all warrants and charges for any petty crime, including small quantity drug dealing or running, that relate to survival. ● Do away with Peace Officers completely. ⅓ of their budget can be used for outreach, Canine Outreach, mental health and addictions professionals. Not associated with EPS. ● We will expand on any of these points if asked. The protest organizers have also expressed concerns about the removal of encampments in Mill Creek Ravine last week. Peace Officers, Park Rangers, and Edmonton Police do not have a record of any encampment closures being conducted by their teams in this area over the past few weeks. Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing Media have been invited to the protest, with CBC News, The Edmonton Journal, and APTN expected to be onsite to interview the youth at the demonstration. An organiser of the protest has indicated that they have talked with a variety of organizations that are aligning with them (such as the John Humphrey Centre) but this has not been confirmed. The Old Strathcona Business Association has expressed concerns that: ● there may be aggressive/disrespectful behaviour or arguments between protesters and businesses or customers in the area ● the protesters may damage the new infrastructure at McIntyre Park ● the protesters may cause damage to businesses near McIntyre Park Media coverage: TBA Designated Administration Spokesperson : Rob Smyth Deputy City Manager, Citizen Services Media Contact: Linda Murphy After Hours Media Manager Communications and Engagement 780-423-5956","No",,,

The rippling impacts of the pandemic on people experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity — from the emergency response at the Edmonton EXPO Centre to growing encampments and movements like Pekiwewin — have thrown the need for affordable and supportive housing into stark relief. With this in mind, Administration continues to work toward its goals of transitioning people out of homelessness and helping to build 2,500 units of affordable housing by 2022 and 900 units of supportive housing by 2024. Supportive Housing Engagement Process On June 29, 2020, City Council approved the below-market sale of City-owned land in Inglewood, King Edward Park, Terrace Heights and McArthur Industrial (referred to as Wellington) to Homeward Trust to develop for supportive housing. Conditions of the land sale include public engagement in all four communities and approved rezonings in King Edward Park, Terrace Heights and Wellington. Between June and August 2020, Administration conducted several engagement activities for the proposed developments to hear initial feedback, answer questions and collect information to inform later phases of public engagement. These include” ● a direct mailer sent to the nearby communities ● check-ins with community leagues and key stakeholders ● seventeen digital roundtable discussions with approximately 120 participants ● social media advertisements to build community awareness ● digital survey with almost 1,500 responses ● community-specific updates on edmonton.ca/supportivehousing Beginning August 24, 2020, public engagement began on good neighbour plans and general building design for each of the developments. Information-sharing and public engagement activities will include: ● a direct mailer sent to nearby communities to provide information about upcoming engagement activities ../2 - 2 - ● on-site signage directed to the website and 311 for more information ● social media advertisements to build community awareness ● resources for community leagues to share about the engagement process and upcoming opportunities ● live-streamed digital information sessions ● a second survey with various input methods ● Engaged Edmonton digital engagement pages for each community ● a final digital survey to validate community feedback and key themes prior to the development of the What We Heard Report In addition to the above activities, Administration will gather community feedback on the rezoning applications for King Edward Park, Terrace Heights and Wellington through their respective engagement processes. Following engagement on the Good Neighbour Plans and building designs, a What We Heard report will be posted publicly and shared with Homeward Trust for consideration. A separate What We Heard Report on the rezoning engagement will be presented to City Council at the rezoning public hearings in December 2020. More information about the supportive housing developments can be found at edmonton.ca/supportivehousing . Bridge Housing Engagement On June 22, 2020, City Council approved the terms of a below-market lease for the dormitory building at Exhibition Lands to Homeward Trust. Public engagement for this project has started. Administration is gathering input and sharing information through: ● updates to community leagues, business improvement areas and key stakeholders ● digital engagement on the Good Neighbour Plan through Engaged Edmonton ● an information session and virtual building tour Following the digital engagement, a What We Heard report will be developed, shared with the community and publicly posted on the City’s website. Upcoming Reports: AHIP Grant Funding and Below Market Lease Administration is bringing forward three reports in September that recommend grant funding for three affordable housing developments and a below-market lease to the Greater Edmonton Foundation for the redevelopment of their Lauderdale site. Together these developments represent 281 units of affordable and supportive housing. This is a significant step forward towards the goal of having 2,500 units of affordable housing by 2022.

Five areas in Edmonton are on the Watch list including Castle Downs (68.1), Eastwood (96.4), Edmonton NE (90), Northgate (108), and Woodcroft East (76.2). MASK COMPLIANCE UPDATE City enforcement officers continue to see good compliance with the temporary face covering bylaw in all areas with few reports of negative interactions. Overall compliance in Edmonton is estimated to be 97%. Edmonton Transit Service is reporting 95% compliance (LRT 86%/Bus 97%), vehicle for hire is reporting 91%, City recreational facilities are reporting 98%, public spaces 99%, and Edmonton Public Libraries are reporting 98%. The BIAs are also reporting good compliance within their communities. There are few reported litter complaints related to discarded disposable masks.

It will be at the discretion of AHS if further action against the allegedly infected parties is warranted. City enforcement officers continue to monitor for potential anti-mask protests or disruption in Edmonton and those taking place in other communities. SCHOOL COVID-19 OUTBREAKS Yesterday, the Province released the school outbreak map that shows the current status of COVID-19 in K-12 schools across Alberta. Schools that have two or more confirmed cases will be identified on the map. The Relaunch Task Team has also developed a template to help quickly identify and map City-owned or operated facilities and services immediately surrounding schools identified by the Province as having a COVID-19 outbreak. This template will be used to determine if the identified areas may need additional cleaning or preventative measures to contain community spread of COVID-19 NEIGHBOURHOOD SERVICES On September 7, Neighbourhood Services was able to support the Meadows Community League in hosting an outdoor drive-in movie . The neighbourhood resource coordinator worked with the league and the Meadows Community Recreation Centre to arrange use of a low-use parking lot after hours, restricted attendance to 100 people for 1.5 hours, and the league issued tickets in advance of the event with license plates as a tracing tool. CAMP PEKIWEWIN & DR. WILBERT MCINTYRE PARK CAMP Today Mayor Don Iveson provided an update to journalists at a media availability on the City’s response to encampments and supports for homelessness. City Administration also met today with the organizer of the Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park demonstration to discuss options for a closure date for the encampment at this location. While discussions on a specific date are ongoing, the City continues to respond to the encampment using standard protocols and timelines for closure and clean up. Mayor Iveson speaks to media on homelessness & encampments today Camp Pekiwewin organizers issued a statement on Twitter yesterday seeking more details on the Mayor's call for a ""10 week plan to end homelessness."" They have offered their collective skillset and lived experiences to help inform this plan. The City will meet with Camp Pekiwewin organizers on September 16, t","6, to discuss the impacts of approaching cold weather on the camp and timing for a jointly agreed upon wind down. The City will provide an update on the outcomes of this discussion at the September 17 Emergency Advisory Committee meeting. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls violence against children the hidden crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from school and daycare closures as many children living with family violence do not have a safe refuge. In Canada, Kids Help Phone has reported an increase in specific conversations about physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. As kids go back to school, reports of suspected child abuse may increase since children will be interacting with trusted adults in their schools. Reports of online sexual exploitation of Canadian children have also soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, as abusers are apparently taking advantage of kids spending more time online. EMPLOYEE ISOLATION/WORK FROM HOME DATA The Workforce Analytics team has completed the COVID-19 reports for the past two weeks. They include updated information on employee COVID-19 test results, those temporarily working from home, in isolation, or on redeployment. In summary: 29% of the City's employees are temporarily working from home. There are 89 employees who are in AHS-directed self-isolation or have health concerns, which is a decrease of 13 since the previous reporting period. 20 (2%) of the 1,130 City of Edmonton employee tests requested or conducted came back positive for COVID-19 and to date, 16 of the 20 employees have recovered.

The Corporate Waste Transformation project is part of the Council approved 25-year Waste Strategy , which aligns with the City’s guiding principle of Climate Resilience. The project supports the City’s goal of 90 per cent waste diversion and challenges the City to lead by example in support of the overall Zero Waste framework. The Corporate Waste Transformation program includes staff work areas like office buildings and industrial yards, as well as public facilities such as recreation centres and attractions. The introduction of the food scraps collection is being done in alignment with City of Edmonton Employee Reorientation to the Workplace guidelines and procedures as well as Alberta Health guidelines for COVID-19. Building spaces leased by the City of Edmonton will not be participating directly in this program. The City of Edmonton, however, is collaborating with the property manager of Edmonton Tower to establish its own food scraps collection program. Food scraps collection is being introduced to City facilities in three phases, so not all facilities will begin at the same time. Timing is also dependent on provincial and municipal health guidelines. ● Phase 1 includes distribution of food scraps bins (generally as part of new three stream waste sorting stations) within 60 City-owned and operated facilities from September to November 2020. Interested employees will be encouraged to start using the new food scraps collection bins as they are introduced into staff kitchens and other common areas. Similar to how staff manage and sort their own recycling, they can support waste diversion by putting their food scraps into the designated bins. ● Phase 2 is planned for November 2020 . It will include a broad marketing and education program to support food scraps collection in staff areas, public areas, and participating food vendors at these 60 facilities. .../2 -2- ● Phase 3 is planned for Spring 2021 . It will include the introduction of food scraps collection in staff and public areas within the remaining 180 City facilities and select outdoor spaces, such as major parks and bookable picnic sites. City Hall will be one of the first facilities to be equipped with the new three stream waste sorting stations (garbage, recycling, food scraps) later in September 2020. Program information will be shared through OneCity and staff Lunch and Learn sessions. Additional education opportunities will be offered in November 2020, once all the bins are distributed to employee-only areas and public-facing areas. By starting with food scraps collection at City facilities and sites, both public visitors and staff will have the opportunity to become familiar with the process. This approach will help build trust in the City’s environmental commitment and smooth the customer transition to organics collection from all single-family homes in Edmonton in 2021. Once the organics collection program is expanded to residences, the City will offer seamless delivery of waste services between residents’ homes and City-owned and operated public spaces. These changes will be communicated to City of Edmonton staff and more program details will be available on OneCity (login through the portal) or by calling Inside Information. If Council members require further information or have questions or feedback about food scraps separation in City Hall, please contact Jodi Goebel, Director Waste Strategy at jodi.goebel@edmonton.ca .

Administration will introduce new sales channels to make it easier for people to purchase and receive their passes, address the continued closure of City facilities and eliminate the need for in-person contact to reduce COVID-19 related risks. Administration has heard frustrations from Ride Transit participants about requiring them to travel to a facility to get their passes, and they indicated the need for more options including the ability to purchase online. During the summer months, passes were distributed by mail at no cost to program participants. Payment will be required for October passes, and sales channels will be in place starting next week for the sale of October passes and will continue on an on-going basis. Passes will be mailed to customers via Canada Post and may take up to 10 business days. Administration will monitor sales volume closely and evaluate the process on a quarterly basis. The following options will be made available to purchase a Ride Transit Pass: Online ● Purchases can be made online at Ride.edmonton.ca 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ● At this time, credit card payment (VISA, Mastercard, American Express) is available online; however, we are working to implement VISA Debit and Debit Mastercard as soon as possible. Phone ● By calling 780-423-RIDE (7433) from Monday to Friday (8:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.). ● Payment options include VISA Debit, Debit Mastercard, VISA, Mastercard, American Express. Auto-Debit for November Pass ● We strongly recommend program participants sign-up for the auto-debit option. ● An automatic withdrawal would come out of the applicant’s bank account a few weeks before the applicable month, and passes are mailed. .../2 -2- By Appointment at a Recreation Centre If none of the above options are possible for the applicant, participants can schedule an appointment to visit one of four City-operated recreation facilities to make their purchase in person. Appointment capacity is limited to minimize in-person contact and adhere to occupancy restrictions at recreation facilities. In August, a survey was conducted with 800 Ride Transit participants to gather feedback about sales options. Most respondents (64%) said their preferred option was either online, auto-debit or by phone. They also shared feedback that online purchasing would be the least difficult option for them. Overall, transit fare sales volume has decreased significantly, corresponding to a decline in ridership due to COVID-19. Most transit customers prefer to pay for single trips with cash, rather than monthly passes (based on July and August fare sales). It is anticipated there will be a similar decline in volume of those purchasing monthly Ride Transit Program passes. Ride Transit Program participants were informed in August about upcoming changes through a letter with their September pass. Additionally, participants will be informed of these alternative payment options through a direct letter mailed this week to their address on file, signage at transit centres, LRT stations and City-operated recreation facilities, social media, website updates, 311, and a Public Service Announcement. Anticipated questions and answers are attached to support your offices in responding to constituent inquiries about the process.

Currently there are 58,524 active COVID-19 cases across the country with daily averages of 5,194 new cases (Nov 19-25). The number of people experiencing severe illness continues to increase with provincial and territorial data indicating that an average of 2,072 people were being treated in hospitals each day during the most recent 7-day period (Nov 19-25), including 428 in intensive care units. During the same period, there were an average of 75 COVID-19-related deaths reported daily. SHELTERS Approximately 100 shelter beds are available in the system. There are currently multiple shelter locations under outbreak. Council update November 24 . There is now a shortage of Tier 1 and Tier 2 isolation spaces in the system.

The City of Edmonton, Government of Alberta, Alberta Health Services and Homeward Trust have immediately convened and are working through options. The City of Edmonton signed its funding agreement with the Government of Canada for the Rapid Housing Initiative and the funds have been transfered. Edmonton was the first City outside of Ontario to complete this process, and that was noted favorably by CMHC. Edmonton Convention Centre (ECC) Today the Bissell Centre and agency partners issued a news release on a COVID-19 outbreak at the ECC. Operators have been closely following Alberta Health public health orders and are now taking additional precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include increased sanitization, signage with distancing reminders and the use of personal protective equipment when responding to overdoses and other medical emergencies. Additional adjustments to service levels may also be made in the coming days to increase the safety of community members and staff within the facility. Edmonton's Neighbourhood Empowerment Team (NET), along with RECOVER and Peace Officers, was on site Tuesday (Nov 24) to identify potential areas that could be animated to alleviate potential disruption concerns around the building. Next steps will include working with Explore Edmonton on the feasibility of adding additional programming and temporary infrastructure such as lights. Commonwealth Stadium Hope Mission has reconfigured cots and daytime amenity space to allow two metres for physical distancing, reducing capacity from 120 to 110. Administration worked with Hope Mission to cross reference COVID-19 positive cases against staff who were working on site to determine any close contacts. No staff were deemed a close contact in need of isolation. Mustard Seed (99 Street) Due to the high number of active COVID-19 cases in the community, mat spacing has been moved to provide two metre spacing. This has reduced capacity to 80 from 100 persons. With reduced capacity Mustard Seed is operating at full capacity. The Mustard Seed Good Neighbor Plan, created with assistance from the City of Edmonton, is now live on the Mustard Seed website . Approximately 1000 copies of the plan will be mailed out to businesses and residents around the 99 Steet site within the week. A small number of community members filed an appeal to SDAB on the Mustard Seed permit. The appeal hearing was conducted today, November 26, with more community members providing support rather than opposition. A written decision of the Appeal Board will be received within 15 days of today. Community Impact Mitigation Strategy Integrated multi-department meetings are held three times a week to assess the actions in the community plans to mitigate community disruption. City liaisons with community and business associations are reporting that things seem quiet around the shelters. 118 Avenue BIA commented they are pleasantly surprised that there have been no issues. CAMP PEKIWEWIN Recommendations on how long the site should remain closed to the public are being considered. The site is cleared of most debris with the exception of some metals. The fencing will be taken down shortly to increase visibility and snow fencing will be put up in its place during the next two weeks. A charter is being drafted by the Encampment Response Team (ERT) to craft lessons learned from Camp Pekiwewin and draft strategic and tactical plans for the spring. LOCAL ECONOMY Work on a “Shop Local” campaign continues as the Local Economy team arranged an introductory meeting with Explore Edmonton to discuss options and look at both a short and long term strategy to advance the promotion of Edmonton businesses. Recent One-on-One outreach was very successful. A “How to Start a Home-Business” webinar was held on November 19 with 41 people registered and a 40% attendance rate. The Local Economy Team also presented to a class of 15 entrepreneurs through community partners MCG Careers Inc. The Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG) Program received 42 individual business applications of which 26 applicants are eligible for a grant. Applications in the Business Association stream for Uproot Collective and FAVA received final approval by the Review Committee. Both projects focus on improving the infrastructure that supports local businesses. The BIA Council drafted a letter to support the extension of the Face Covering Bylaw. The BIA’s are strongly supportive of the bylaw as a measure to help keep all businesses, their employees and their customers safe OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION EMPLOYEE ISOLATION/WORK FROM HOME DATA: The Workforce Analytics team has updated the COVID-19 employee data at edmonton.ca . 97 (5%) of the 2,084 City of Edmonton employee tests requested or conducted came back positive for COVID-19 and to date, 72 of the 97 employees have recovered. 31% of the City's employees are temporarily working from home. 244 employees are in AHS-directed self-isolation or have health concerns representing an increase of 55 since the previous reporting period. ENCAMPMENTS: From November 17 - 23, the Encampment Response Team received 16 calls for service from 311 and other internal agencies. 53 encampment files require investigation and 37 known camps are currently being monitored. There have been 22 encampment files closed. To date in 2020, the team has received 4,265 calls for service with 4,166 encampment files investigated and closed. MENTAL HEALTH: Mental health is not only characterized as the absence of mental disorders but also as a state of well-being in which each individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. Administration does not have access to a database that will show current or weekly mental health status for the community. In May / June 2020 the Health Quality Council of Alberta conducted a survey of Albertans with results showing COVID-19 is having a negative impact on mental health. Seventy per cent of people felt more stressed because of the pandemic and 72 per cent found it difficult to cope. Twenty-eight per cent of the 11,000 people surveyed reported an increase in alcohol use while 14 per cent used more cannabis. The Health Quality Council of Alberta recently concluded a followup survey in the month of October. Results from this survey when released will be provided in future updates. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. To date this year, EPS is showing a 16% increase in domestic violence calls (7931 occurrences year to date in 2020 compared to 6851 average # year to date occurrences from 2017-2019). The number of occurrences with Assault charges is almost the same as the three-year average at -1%, but the most serious charge on these files is much more severe in 2020. Aggravated Assaults are up by 38% and Assault – Bodily Harm or With Weapon is up 56%. These numbers also do not include the new category of Assault – Choke, Suffocates or Strangles which accounts for another 122 serious assaults in 2020. Weekly percentage change in domestic violence occurrences: ● Pre-COVID Response: January – March 15 (11 weeks) Average +7% ● Initial Lockdown March 16 – May 13 (8 weeks) Average +27% ● Stage 1 Reopening - May 14 – Jun 11 (5 weeks) Average +0% ● Stage 2 Reopening - Jun 12 – current (21 weeks) Average +22% The Family Violence Prevention Team is conducting a perception survey of the general population to assist in evaluating changes in the public’s awareness of gender-based violence and sexual assault and inform future actions. This is a planned follow up to the survey conducted in 2016 at the start of the Gender Based Violence initiative and will include a question regarding the impacts of COVID-19 On November 23, Councillor Esslinger hosted a roundtable discussion with community and regional partners to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on gender based violence and to inform work underway on the Federal Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender Based Violence. Also present were representatives from the office of The Honourable Minister Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development. Many communities and municipalities are seeing similar gaps and trends related to domestic violence. Many identified a need for more regional collaboration in addition to addressing: ● A lack of housing options ● A need for mental health and addictions supports ● Improved access to technology ● Gaps in financial support TRANSIT: Bus-only transit ridership for the week of November 15 - 21 was 672,394 weekday passenger boardings. This represents a 16% increase in ridership for this week and a 44% ridership recovery compared to the same week in 2019. Comparative transit data weeks 36-47 COVID-19 IN ALBERTA November 24, 2020 To: City Council From: Rob Smyth Deputy City Manager, Citizen Services Subject: Outbreaks Declared at Temporary Accommodations Alberta Health Services has declared COVID-19 outbreaks at the temporary accommodation at the Edmonton Convention Centre and at the Hope Mission shelter at Commonwealth Stadium. Given the degree of community transmission currently occurring in Edmonton and the relatively low threshold for declaring an outbreak in a shelter setting, these events were not unexpected. Protecting the health and safety of clients and staff at all temporary accommodations for individuals experiencing homelessness is of the highest priority. Operators have been closely following Alberta Health public health orders and are now taking additional precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include increased sanitization, signage with distancing reminders and the use of personal protective equipment when responding to overdoses and other medical emergencies. Capacity at Edmonton Convention Centre remains at 300 as cots were already spaced at two metres to proactively meet the outbreak requirement. At Commonwealth Stadium, Hope Mission has reconfigured cots and daytime amenity space to allow two metres for physical distancing, reducing capacity from 120 to 110. Administration is working with the operators to cross-reference individuals identified with COVID-19 and City staff who may have interacted with them. This work is ongoing and at this time no City staff have been determined as a close contact in need of isolation. Operators will continue to work with Alberta Health Services to ensure the safety of clients, staff and the broader community. Anyone who tests positive will receive appropriate medical care in an isolation space. We anticipate Alberta Health will add Edmonton Convention Centre as an outbreak location on its website today. Partner agencies will be leading the response on the outbreak with the media and public. Administration will continue to provide support to our partners during this challenging time.

Individuals who tested positive were immediately taken to an isolation space in the facility, before being moved to the Edmonton Isolation Facility run by Boyle McCauley Health Centre. Contact tracing was immediately undertaken. Since the opening of the 24/7 temporary accommodation space on October 30, partner agencies of the temporary accommodation (Bissell Centre, Boyle Street Community Services, The Mustard Seed and Bent Arrow Healing Society) have been closely following Alberta Health Services public health orders. Measures being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include mandatory screening at the entrance, temperature checks and a questionnaire. Additional precautions have been put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. These include enhanced cleaning, signage with distancing reminders and the use of personal protective equipment when responding to overdoses and other medical emergencies. Masking and distancing will continue to be enforced among participants. Key services will continue during the outbreak. These include day shelter and meal services, overnight shelter, medical services, overdose prevention, cultural supports and housing supports. Non-essential programming has been suspended for two weeks and further adjustments to services may be made to ensure the safety of staff and community members. Protecting the health and safety of clients and staff at the temporary accommodations for individuals experiencing homelessness is of the highest priority. Operators will continue to work with Alberta Health Services to ensure the safety of clients, staff and the broader community.

Providing support for vulnerable populations and finding housing for those experiencing homelessness are shared priorities between Administration and camp organizers. Administration has reviewed the organizers’ demands and is responding with information on what the City is currently doing and plans for the future to make progress towards the shared goals that are reflected in these demands. Administration has also asked the organizers to provide a proposed date by which the camp will close. As overnight temperatures continue to drop below the freezing point, the camp’s outdoor sanitation services, such as handwashing stations, will be disrupted. In the midst of a pandemic, a large encampment without functioning sanitation becomes a significant safety risk. At the same time, the number of COVID-19 cases in Edmonton is growing. While Alberta Health Services provides continued access points for COVID testing within the Edmonton area for all Albertans, onsite testing at the encampment is not available. Without proper sanitation, we must consider how an outbreak at the encampment would put the health and safety of occupants and the surrounding community at risk. It is important that we take preventative action now, instead of waiting for a COVID-19 outbreak to occur. The attached letter invites the camp organizers to meet with us on Wednesday, September 16, 2020 to discuss the closure of the camp. Further details on this meeting and next steps related to Camp Pekiwewin will also be provided at the September 21 City Council meeting. Administration is also working with the organizer of the Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park encampment by providing information on existing supports for youth experiencing homelessness and finalizing the wind down date for that camp in the coming days.

The Edmonton Riverhawks will play in the West Coast League beginning in the 2021-2022 season. The Riverhawks name is a play on words acknowledging that they play baseball in Edmonton’s beautiful river valley. Hawks are known to frequent water in our area (red tails) and “ballhawks” are known in baseball as players who are great at fielding balls. The West Coast League is the top amateur baseball league in Canada. In the 2019 Major League Baseball draft, 90 players were selected from the West Coast League, including the number one and number three selections. The league was founded in 2005 and has a mission of providing affordable, fan-friendly baseball experiences while fostering professional, innovative development for college ballplayers. The City is currently in the final stages of negotiations with Baseball Edmonton Inc. to operate RE/MAX Field for the next 10 years. The organization is committed to working with the City to enhance and increase community use of the facility and also support efforts outlined in the River Crossing plan. Baseball Edmonton Inc. ownership group features individuals who have long histories in Edmonton. The organization is led by former Edmonton Oiler Dr. Randy Gregg, businessmen Gary Gregg (Gregg Distributors), and Dale Wishewan (Booster Juice).

EPL ON THE SQUARE: Since August 5, 2020, The City of Edmonton has been collaborating with the Edmonton Public Library (EPL) and community partners to operate EPL on the Square.

The downtown library will be able to accommodate the demand for services experienced on the Square. While EPL’s Outreach Workers (registered social workers) remain on site at EPL on the Square to offer their professional support, community partners have started to lessen their presence on the Square. Partners offered services for housing, financial empowerment, wellness and mental health, among other supports and included: Homeward Trust’s Coordinated Access Team, Recreation and Wellness Workers from Boyle Street Community Services, Housing and Employment Workers from the Bissell Centre, and COE Community Navigators. In total, EPL staff welcomed 951 visits from Edmontonians between August 5 and September 5. The Square was most well used during warm, clear days. The service has been extremely well received by the community and feedback has been very enthusiastic and demonstrates that Edmontonians value EPL on the Square services. Customers of all ages and various backgrounds including vulnerable Edmontonians, newcomers and families have stopped by to connect with EPL staff. Perhaps EPL on the Square’s most significant impact has been the efforts to address the digital divide, an issue which was worsened during the pandemic. The initiative enabled access to computers and the Internet in the downtown core, when no other options were available. ANTI-MASK PROTEST: The Province has notified the City of a potential anti-mask protest at a local grocery store this Wednesday evening with an unknown number of protesters intending to enter the store without face coverings or masks. The Relaunch Task Team has informed Edmonton Police Service of the possible protest and Community Standards staff have advised store management. LOCAL ECONOMY: The Local Economy One-on-One Support Program has received 13 new clients in September bringing the number of open files to 109.

A remaining 136 encampment files require investigation and 46 known camps are currently being monitored. There have been 106 encampment files closed. To date in 2020, the team has received 3,286 calls for service with 3,082 encampment files investigated and closed. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. Community partners and agencies working in domestic violence prevention noted the following trends and gaps around domestic violence: ● An increase in the complexity and severity of domestic violence. The intersections of complexity include: ○ Increase in the severity of violence - increase in physical violence ○ Housing - there is difficulty finding affordable housing after leaving a shelter. Many return to an abusive situation due to lack of housing. ○ Financial - many have lost their job, or their abusive partner has lost their job leaving them with one income or little to no income. ○ Mental health - ranging from coping skills to mental health crisis (suicidal ideation). Some service providers expressed challenges with accessing affordable/free mental health counselling. ○ Addictions - some people are coping with the stress of being in an abusive relationship and stressors of COVID through drug and alcohol use. Many service providers spoke about the resilience and coping skills of people experiencing domestic violence. Many are aware of resources and are reaching out for help, but are unable to leave the relationship because of financial constraints, lack of housing, and other issues noted above. One service provider noted an increase in reporting to the police from a concerned third party such as a family member or neighbour; highlighting the importance of informal supporters. Lack of access to technology is also a barrier. Many clients access initial information, further communication, and/or counselling sessions virtually. Many do not have computers or reliable internet. As well, some do not have computer literacy skills to use technology like Zoom for counselling sessions. It was also noted that clients access EPL and Alberta Works computers for their technology needs and availability of these is limited due to COVID-19. Anecdotally, one service provider estimated this impacts approximately 10% of their clients while a City of Edmonton Domestic Abuse High Risk Team social worker noted that between 30-50% of her clients use these publicly accessible computers for communication. Service providers identified both barriers related to the justice system. Many noted that perpetrators of violence are not being remanded because of COVID-19 so judges are releasing them within 24-48 hours and/or with minimal conditions and they are returning right back to the home. This is making safety planning with victims very challenging. People also noted the delay in the court system with trials on hold for up to 10 weeks. GENDER BASED VIOLENCE & SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION INITIATIVE As per the action plan for the gender-based violence and sexual assault prevention initiative, the Family Violence Prevention Team is conducting a perception survey of the general population. This survey will assist us to evaluate changes in the public’s awareness of gender-based violence and sexual assault and will inform future actions. This is a planned follow up to a baseline survey conducted in 2016 at the start of the initiative and will include a question regarding the impacts of COVID-19. TRANSIT: Today Edmonton Transit Service issued a news release with an update on service resumption and fall scheduling. Current transit ridership remains around 50 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels, however, recent data shows signs that ridership is slowly increasing. Due to COVID-19, most City-operated facilities remain closed for in-person Ride Transit Program pass sales. Only a limited number of in-person appointments are available for Ride Transit participants to purchase a monthly pass at select City recreation facilities. As a result, and based on program participant feedback, new sales channels have been introduced to purchase October Ride Transit Program passes. Passes will need to be mailed, and may take up to 10 business days via Canada Post. The City will monitor sales volume closely. Further details were shared in the news release. Eddie Robar, Branch Manager, Edmonton Transit Service, also provided an update to journalists online during a virtual media availability. Bus-only transit ridership for the week of September 6 -12 was 694,285 weekday passenger boardings. Compared to last week transit observed 2.2% more ridership. This represents a 44% ridership recovery this week as compared to the same week in 2019 when the Labour Day holiday is considered or a 48% recovery if excluded.

The camp organizer recently reported a violent incident in the area surrounding Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park, which has been confirmed by EPS and has prompted elevated concerns for the safety and well-being of those in the camp and the surrounding community. The camp organizer previously indicated that the camp would be temporary and committed to respond to the City on September 11 with a proposed date for closure.

Voluntary asymptomatic testing will continue to be offered for priority groups that are most at risk of spreading COVID-19 to vulnerable or at-risk populations. This includes: school teachers and staff, residents and staff in congregate settings, health-care workers, Albertans experiencing homelessness, and travellers who require testing prior to departure. Voluntary asymptomatic testing is no longer recommended for other Albertans who have no symptoms and no suspected exposure to COVID-19.

Overall compliance is estimated to be 97%. Edmonton Transit Service is reporting 96% compliance (LRT 86%/Bus 98%), vehicle for hire 93%, City recreational facilities 97%, public space 99%, and Edmonton Public Library 96%. The BIAs are also reporting good compliance within their communities. FACE COVERING EXEMPTION CARDS Following consultations with the business community through Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) and with the Accessibility Advisory Committee (AAC), the City will discontinue any further distribution of exemption cards. The City will continue to support people who have an exemption as outlined in the bylaw and will increase communications to the business sector regarding legitimate exemptions while encouraging businesses and individuals who have an exemption to find ways to, respectively, accommodate and request service through alternate means. To help reduce chances of confrontations, the City will also continue its communications to the general public on tolerance and compassion so that Edmontonians are aware that individuals not wearing a face covering may have legitimate exemptions that may not be immediately obvious. Communications will also highlight the use of acceptable types of face coverings. Administration will work with the AAC on how best to support impacted individuals going forward. It will schedule a meeting in a month’s time to review data such as the numbers of calls to the City related to face coverings, issues, problems and related feedback. Edmontonians dealing with refusal of service issues will be directed to call 311 to register individual business concerns and City staff will follow up with business owners and complainants. Businesses will be encouraged to offer alternative services such as curbside pickup, appointments, drop delivery, friend or guardian pick-ups, call ahead service, etc. Mayor Iveson speaks with the media after EAC DR. WILBERT MCINTYRE PARK CAMP & CAMP PEKIWEWIN The encampment at Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park has approximately 20 tents and up to 30 occupants. An operational plan has been prepared with input from Community Standards and Neighbourhoods, Edmonton Police Service (EPS), Communications, and Social Development for the peaceful shutdown of the camp by Peace Officers with EPS support. A vacancy notice was served to the camp and organizers","anizers via email on Wednesday, September 16. Peace officers have followed up and provided verbal notice to camp occupants to vacate by September 18, when a closure and cleaning of the site will occur. The City is asking the organizer and campers for cooperation with a dignified and respectful closure of the camp. Despite previously agreeing to remove the camp within a week, the camp organizer is vowing to remain until all demands are met. At Camp Pekiwewin, approximately 170 tents remain on site while the number of occupants have been decreasing slightly and some tents are vacant. Organizers estimate 250 campers remain. Homeward Trust, Boyle Street and the Bissell Centre have outreach and housing support workers on site and are working with organizers to try to reach all residents of the encampment. Alberta Health Services (AHS) continues to conduct weekly inspections with the most recent inspection on Friday, September 11, identifying concerns with garbage. City Administration has taken over maintenance of the portable toilets and hand washing station contract and cleaning has been increased to four times a week. Camp organizers continue to express concerns around access to showers. The Neighbourhood Empowerment Team (NET) continues to work within the community of Rossdale and is active in the community two or three days a week. Activities include environmental scans, connecting with residents to hear concerns and providing information and referrals. NET has also connected with Capital City Clean Up regarding concerns of an increase in discarded needles and Capital City Clean Up has offered to conduct more frequent needle collections. NET also continues to hear concerns from the community regarding an increase of smaller camps near Camp Pekiwewin, increase of social disorder from members of the Camp Pekiwewin, cleanliness and concerns around the timeline for closure of the camp.

Homeward Trust, Boyle McCauley Health Centre, City Administration, Government of Alberta, and AHS are working toward an action plan in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19. While dialogue has begun on the demands of the camp organizers, there are considerations that lead Administration to believe a camp wind down will be required.

City of Edmonton Position: Our top priority is the health and safety of City of Edmonton employees and the public. As soon as we learned of each of the employees’ positive test results, we have been taking action. Contact tracing was done by the City of Edmonton to determine employees who may have had contact with these two employees. Alberta Health Services (AHS) is also conducting contact tracing and will determine if there are any further actions required. We will follow the advice and recommendation of AHS, including any required public communications. Key Messages: ● Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and the public. ● The City of Edmonton has a detailed and comprehensive process for addressing positive COVID-19 cases among its workforce and is positioned to take an active and rapid response for assessing and managing risk internally and to the public. ● We can confirm there are two positive cases at Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. ○ The City took immediate action upon learning of the positive test results upon notification of each case and notified City employees who may have been in contact with the employees. ○ In an abundance of caution, the immediate work group has been advised to get tested, even if they are not experiencing symptoms. 17(1) 17(1) Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing ● This is a possible workplace transmission, which would be the first for the City of Edmonton, if confirmed. ● The employees are not public-facing employees and have no contact with the public. Based on our assessment, the risk to the public is low. ● We have a duty to protect the privacy of each City employee, and can not share specific information. Right now, the employees need our support and compassion. ● Alberta Health Services is investigating these cases and has not made a determination on outbreak status at this time; however it typically considers workplace outbreaks to have occurred when there are five confirmed cases. Public Safety ● All necessary steps have been taken to address the situation and to ensure the safety and well being of all staff, contractors and visitors to Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage. ● We have taken steps to have the immediate work area and common areas deep cleaned and disinfected using an electrostatic sprayer. ● We continue to use a disinfecting agent applied with an electrostatic sprayer to all ETS vehicles before they go into service, at transit centres and LRT stations. ● Workplace Safety and Employee Health will continue to partner with operations to assess and support the safety protocols in place at Kathleen Andrews Transit Garage to ensure they adhere to Alberta Health and AHS guidelines. ● All City of Edmonton employees are required to take a self assessment prior to commencing each shift, before they come to work. Approach : FFS and Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) leadership have contacted employees who may have come in contact with the affected employees during the period in question, as well as the immediate work group. The City will follow the advice and recommendations of AHS, including if public notification is necessary as a precautionary measure. Communications will work with FFS and ETS leadership to ensure any affected employee has the information they need and are supported, while protecting their privacy.

Given the amount of work underway and the brisk pace at which it is taking place, I will be sharing bi-weekly memo updates to keep you informed of our progress. We are undertaking a similar process with other key stakeholders in the organization including senior leaders who are uniquely positioned and pivotal players in guiding and motivating teams through the significant changes ahead, all staff through various media channels including livestream videos, and with our union partners. In advance of our Collective Bargaining Update at Council September 21, I wanted to focus you on the work we have been doing to modernize our workforce. The reimagined way forward requires a new way of working in light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and our fiscal realities. This new way of working will include: ● programs that support flexibility in how and where we work such as the continued Temporary Work from Home Arrangement, a Remote Work Program for non union employees which will launch at the end of September, and a Workplace Reintegration Plan which sets building occupancy thresholds and provides resources to support and enhanced safe work practices. ● continued work with our union partners to develop and implement a Remote Work Program for our unionized employees. Until then, these employees who are participating in the City’s Temporary Work From Home Arrangement will continue to do so (subject to business needs, etc.). ● ongoing development and continuous improvement of our agile workforce will allow for the adaptation, optimization, and successful service delivery to Edmontonians in the unprecedented and rapidly changing environment. In addition to the collective bargaining update next week, there are a number of other key dates and conversations related to budget forthcoming. This includes tax policy discussions in October and in November, we will present updated COVID-19 budget impact forecasts for 2020 and 2021, one-time budget reductions to offset the effects of COVID-19 and ongoing budget reduction strategies resulting from prioritized capital and operating budgets and Reimagine.

Using the common policy, each shareholder municipality would then draft a bylaw appropriate for their municipality. Notwithstanding the common AIHA policy, individual municipal Councils will determine if and how bylaws will proceed in their own municipalities. Fort Saskatchewan will take its draft bylaw for first reading on December 8, 2020. Background The City of Edmonton is one of five shareholders of Alberta's Industrial Heartland Association (AIHA). The mandate of AIHA is to attract industrial investment into Canada's largest hydrocarbon-processing centre located in the northeast of Metro Edmonton. Mayor Iveson sits on the Board. Councillor Aaron Paquette sits as the City's Alternate on the Board. On May 29, 2020, AIHA's Board unanimously agreed to adopt a Heartland Incentive Program by committing member municipalities to a coordinated implementation of new Municipal Government Act (MGA) property tax incentive provisions (Bill 7 and Bill 29). Bill 7 permits non-residential tax exemptions. Bill 29 permits the exemption of Machinery and Equipment tax (M&E). The City of Edmonton currently exempts the taxation of M&E in Edmonton. A draft policy and bylaw was formed with involvement of subject matter experts from each shareholder municipality. While the AIHA Board has approved an incentive policy framework it will be up to each individual Heartland municipal Council to determine when to approve a bylaw. Heartland Incentive Policy Criteria For a project or investment to qualify for the Heartland Incentive Program, it must meet the following criteria: Office of the Deputy City Manager URBAN FORM AND CORPORATE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT Memorandum 11/27/2020 Reference No.: 379130443-001 To: City Council From: Stephanie McCabe, Deputy City Manager Subject: Alberta's Industrial Heartland Tax Incentive ● Deploy a Capital Cost Expenditure of more than $50 million (Canadian) dollars; ● Be physically located within the designated area of Alberta's Industrial Heartland; ● Be within the Energy Value Chain or Associated Infrastructure; ● Be a New or Expansion Project; ● Employ over 250 personnel during construction and more than 15 skilled permanent staff upon completion during operation; ● New construction to Alberta's Industrial Heartland (excludes operations that are transitioning from one AIHA jurisdiction to another AIHA jurisdiction); ● Only municipal portions of non-residential property tax are eligible for the exemption. Provincial education property tax requisitions are excluded from any reduction. Tax Incentive ● M&E Tax - as the City currently exempts Machinery and Equipment from tax, the City of Edmonton is already offering this incentive. This has been factored into the policy. ● As per the policy, the City may, in addition to this, establish a bylaw that will offer non-residential tax exemptions valued at up to 1% of Project Capital Cost Expenditures, over a ten year period. Incentive Applicable to Energy Value Chain The investment must be in the Energy Value Chain which is interpreted as the processing or utilization of hydrocarbons in such a way that produces high-value products relative to the feedstock and may include, but is not limited to, projects that involve manufacturing products, researching and developing product lines and new technology, transporting and storage of products and services directly relating to manufacturing, researching or transporting products. Moving Forward Administration is developing a draft bylaw and will bring it forward for consideration in 2021 as part of Administration's response to Council's November 2, 2020 motion on Improving Industrial Competitiveness. The City of Fort Saskatchewan will be taking their bylaw for first reading on December 8, 2020. Their Council reports will be released to the public on December 1, 2020.

On September 18, while Edmonton Police Service and Peace Officers were onsite, the City engaged the organizers in ongoing discussions to facilitate a peaceful closure of the camp. That afternoon, an organizer of the camp preemptively announced that they were granted a seven day extension to the media, before discussing this option with City representatives. In subsequent conversations, the organizers have agreed to publicly announce that they will voluntarily close the camp seven days after receiving a copy of a letter from Administration inviting local service providers to visit the camp if they have capacity. Administration plans to issue this letter on Monday, September 21. In response, we expect a peaceful and voluntary closure of the camp by the organizers on September 28. The camp organizers understand that if safety issues arise at any time, the City will need to respond. The City does not endorse the presence of the camp on this land, but will delay enforcement actions temporarily. I will provide you with new information as it becomes available. RS/ch c.

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. Built in 1954, the Northwestern Utilities Ltd. building is significant for its Early Modern Style architecture. The building was designed by prominent Edmonton architect’s of the mid-century era, Rule Wynn Rule. The firm was unique in that it was Alberta based at a time when most leading Canadian architecture firms operated out of Ontario and Quebec. In addition, the building is significant for its association with the Northwestern Utilities company, which was established in Edmonton and grew to become the largest distributor of natural gas in Canada. The property owner had initially considered retaining the building and incorporating it into a broader redevelopment of the site however, the building has been subject to increasingly frequent break ins that have become a significant liability concern. With no immediate plans for the redevelopment of the site, and without confidence they can ensure the building is secure, they are now seeking to demolish it. The property owner has been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate Northwestern Utilities Ltd. building as a Municipal Historic Resource. They have also satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality with the authority to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be 1 provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. c: Executive Leadership Team Kim Petrin, Branch Manager, Development Services Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments 2",,"No",,,

The Throne Speech outlined the government’s agenda and priorities, with an emphasis on the health and economic crisis facing the nation. The Prime Minister's rare address on the same day as a Throne Speech was mostly a repeat of his government’s plans and a caution to Canadians to be diligent about their behaviours in combatting the pandemic. The following is a high level summary of the two addresses, and some potential impacts on the City of Edmonton. Throne Speech The minority Liberal Government’s second Speech from the Throne was delivered today by Governor General Julie Payette, opening the second session of the 43rd parliament. This is the 150th speech since confederation. The 54 minute speech (longer than recent speeches) was titled “A Stronger and More Resilient Canada”. It laid out four foundations for the government’s agenda: ● Protecting Canadians from COVID-19 ● Helping Canadians through the pandemic ● Building back better – a resiliency agenda for the middle class ● The Canada we’re fighting for The speech reiterated some of the measures that had been provided the last six months to support individuals and businesses. There were commitments to extend or modify some of the programs. For example the creation of a transitional Canada Recovery Benefit to replace the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and reform the Employment Insurance (EI) system to be the sole delivery mechanism to cover self-employed people and those in the gig economy. There will also be an extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy till next summer. To support a return to work, particularly for women, there will be a new Canada-wide early learning system that will provide subsidies for before and after school child care. There was also a commitment to establish new national standards for long term care and the ramping up of plans for a national universal pharmacare program. For cities such as Edmonton, the speech repeated the funding announced September 21 for a $1 billion Rapid Housing Initiative. This was welcome news and a direct response to Council’s discussion and advocacy decisions on August 31, 2020. The speech repeated the pledge for continuing to implement the National Housing Strategy originally announced in 2017 and further stated that “...given the progress that has been made, and our commitment to do more, the Government is now focused on entirely eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.” The municipal sector was also mentioned in the context of the Liberal government continuing to honour its 2019 election promise to give municipalities the authority to ban handguns. The Alberta government has made some related moves to establish a new Alberta chief firearms officer and replace the federally-designated officer in 2021. Cities and the environment were also linked to plans for preserving green spaces and the Liberal commitment to plant two billion trees. And there was a commitment to proceed with legislation next year to ban single use plastics. The latter is an interest for Edmonton as part of the City’s climate change adaptation and energy transition strategies. The Government will soon be releasing an update to Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan which will outline the Government’s economic and fiscal position, provide fiscal projections, and set out the new measures to implement this Throne Speech. Opposition parties in Parliament will have the opportunity to debate and vote for or against this Throne Speech. It is subject to a confidence vote. Initial response from the parties shows distinct criticism from each of them on various aspects of the government’s plan. Prime Minister’s Address to the Nation The Prime Minister’s address was mostly a repeat of the Speech from the Throne, with some pointed words about the need for Canadians to remain diligent in fighting the pandemic. Justin Trudeau called on people to use the tools in the toolbox - wear masks, use the federal COVID tracing app, wash hands, keep distance from others, limit their social circle and listen to public health advice. He said we can bend the curve and get any second wave under control. The leaders of the opposition parties were all given an opportunity to respond. For the most part they used their time to repeat their critiques of the Liberal government’s plans. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Eng., Deputy City Manager","Removal of Shared Streets and Lane Closures",,"Memo Document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=17fYfa1c2hkXLp4Zl7XZpPgZaWKy3PagB)","This memo provides an update on Shared Streets and lane closures which were implemented to allow for physical distancing in high density areas as part of the response to COVID-19. ● Shared Streets are residential roadways that are open for people who walk, bike, roll and drive. The streets are signed as restricted to local vehicle traffic only and the speed limit is reduced to 20 km/hr. ● Lane Closures are on arterial and collector roadways around high density neighbourhoods. A travel lane is converted to a shared space for people to walk, bike, and roll. Vehicle access is restricted in the lanes and the adjacent roadway speed limit was reduced to 40 km/hr. As Fall approaches, all Shared Streets and most lane closures will be removed. Removing these adjustments supports increased vehicle traffic with back to school and return to work, and considers increased costs and maintenance requirements due to winter conditions. Each temporary street adjustment was evaluated to determine the appropriate action to best support the needs of Edmontonians. Shared Streets will be removed beginning in late October. Lane closures will be removed beginning in late September through to the beginning of November. Communications are planned, starting this week, to notify Edmontonians of these changes. Please refer to edmonton.ca/streets for a full list of the removals. Many of the lane closures and shared streets required a temporary reduction in the speed limit and temporary modifications to travel lanes. Within the Speed Zones Bylaw, a temporary change to a speed limit may be completed on a roadway for a period of six months before this change must be approved by City Council through a bylaw amendment. The provision of lane closures and shared streets between April 2020 and early November 2020 generally aligns with this process. The lane modifications have been made through a separate process, which does not have an associated time limit. .../2 -2- A number of lessons were learned through the Shared Streets and lane closures implemented in 2020, including confirming (through a partnership study with the University of Alberta) how they positively impacted individuals' abilities to physically distance. These experiences have provided many considerations that will be explored further when looking at opportunities for 2021.

How many accounts suspended their monthly payments from March 2020 to August 2020, and how many have since been reinstated? 2. Of those with MPP’s reinstated, how many were charged the 2% reinstatement fee and what has been the total cost of this reinstatement fee? Background Monthly Payment Program (MPP) is an option for taxpayers to pay their annual property tax bill in twelve instalments from January to December by automatic bank withdrawal. For taxpayers who enrol in the program to begin their instalments in January, there is no fee to join. However, for those taxpayers who join the program after January in a year, a 2% administration fee is applied on the missed instalments, in order to provide fairness to those taxpayers who have been making monthly payments since January and to acknowledge the additional administrative time to calculate back-payments. This fee is typically small as it is only applied to missed payments. Update In mid-March, when it became clear that the impact resulting from Covid-19 would be significant, City administration permitted taxpayers who were on the MPP to delay their April monthly instalment in an attempt to help keep taxpayers on the MPP rather than cancel off the program. In April, City Council approved a further delay of May to August instalments for requesting taxpayers. In total, 2,089 tax accounts took advantage of the payment delay program offered by the City. These taxpayers remained on the MPP, and were not charged any additional administration fees to take advantage of the payment delays. While those taxpayers who chose to delay payments were not charged administrative fees, some taxpayers chose instead to cancel their participation in the MPP and rejoin the MPP at a later date. Upon rejoining the MPP, a 2% administration fee was charged for any missed instalments, as per the normal monthly payment program rules. Cancelling off the MPP is a normal part of program administration. Taxpayers cancel for a variety of reasons including sale of property, payment default, or simply wishing to return to annual payment status. For the period of March to August, cancellations from the MPP for both 2019 and 2020 are shown below. The total number of cancellations decreased during this period by 2%, but the reasons for the cancellations shifted. In 2020, fewer cancellations occurred due to property sales, and a greater number of cancellations occurred due to default or taxpayer request. March - August 2020 March - August 2019 % change Property Sales 1,890 2,993 -37% Taxpayer Requests 1,336 959 42% Defaulted 602 402 50% Total Cancellations 4,420 4,516 -2% Digging into this data further, Administration notes that only 112 of the 1,366 taxpayer requested cancellations subsequently rejoined the MPP with an administration fee. Those fees were typically small for the majority of accounts (approximately $150), but 15 commercial accounts received significantly higher charges (totaling $83,000). Of the 602 property owners that defaulted, 104 were subsequently reinstated with administrative fees. Total fees across all 104 accounts was less than $10,000 with three commercial accounts paying approximately half of that amount while the remaining 101 averaged a fee of about $40. To summarize, property owners that chose to take advantage of the City’s payment delay program were not charged administrative fees. Some property owners who either canceled or defaulted off the plan and then subsequently requested to rejoin were charged administrative fees. Overall, the number of MPP cancellations in 2020 was not unusual, but the number of cancellations due to taxpayer request or default did increase. MP/cw c.

Stadium LRT Station Crews are making progress on the revitalization of Stadium LRT Station, and expect to complete demolition and track replacement work on the southbound track in the first week of October. Once that work is completed, crews will start repairing the waterproofing on the east roof of the concourse level and installing two pedestrian crossings. As a result, from early October until late November, Capital/Metro trains will run every 15 minutes, with Metro Line trains running between Century Park and NAIT. These service changes apply during both peak and off-peak hours everyday. Partial LRT Closure between Century Park and South Campus From October 10-12, crews will be upgrading the tracks north of Southgate Station in order to reduce maintenance costs and noise for nearby residents. During this work, there will be no trains running between Century Park and South Campus stations. LRT replacement buses will operate between these stations every 5 minutes on Saturday and every 7-8 minutes on Sunday and Monday (Thanksgiving). .../2 -2- Capital Line trains will run every 15 minutes between South Campus and Clareview stations. Metro Line trains will run every 15 minutes between South Campus and NAIT stations. Administration has an integrated marketing and communications plan that informs transit riders, residents near the tracks and other stakeholders about major LRT maintenance and revitalization projects. Customers and stakeholders will be informed through edmonton.ca/tlcforlrt, ETS social media and signage at stations. By continuing to advance these maintenance and revitalization projects, the City shows its commitment to long-term LRT operations and enhanced customer experience.

The Heritage Valley Park & Ride and Transit Centre were completed on time and on budget in late 2019. The budget was $30 million. On February 19, 2020, Administration provided an update on Heritage Valley Park and Ride via the Council Memo update regarding Free parking stalls at Century Park return to land developer . The shuttle service between Heritage Valley and Century Park was initially targeted to begin in early 2020. In the fall of 2018, a growth service package was approved providing $2.97M and 26 FTE per year in operating funding required to deliver the shuttle service. In fall 2019, the decision was made to delay the opening of the Heritage Valley Park and Ride to December 2020, and redirect the funding to partially offset the Valley Line Southeast Precursor Service. This service would be needed to bridge the gap in capacity between the launch of the redesigned bus network, then planned for April 2020, to the start of revenue service on the Valley Line Southeast LRT Line. Part of the City’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic was to delay the launch of the redesigned bus network, removing the requirement for the Valley Line Southeast Precursor Service and associated funding. The cost savings of delaying the start of the Heritage Valley Park and Ride Shuttle to December 2020 were then redirected into Administration’s efforts to manage the negative impact of COVID-19 on the overall financial position of the City. Should the shuttle service between Heritage Valley and Century Park start earlier than December 2020, operational cost savings of approximately $250,000 per month would be forgone, and additional costs of approximately $200,000 per month would be required. These additional costs reflect the workforce constraints at ETS; shifts would be filled largely through overtime as the additional hiring for the shuttle service is not completed due to a hiring pause in the summer of 2020. .../2 -2- Administration continues to be on schedule to begin operating this shuttle service this December. The shuttle service will provide a temporary connection between the Heritage Valley Transit Centre and the end of the Capital Line at Century Park, until such time as the LRT is extended to Ellerslie Road. Administration will provide additional updates as required. For further information, please contact Eddie Robar, Branch Manager, ETS at eddie.robar@edmonton.ca .

The objective of this audit was to assess if the Alberta Emergency Management Agency has an effective system to coordinate a provincial hazard assessment that would identify provincial emergency management priorities for mitigation and preparedness activities. The review of the Provincial Hazard Assessment for Emergency Management was completed alongside independent, but complementary, audits conducted by the City of Edmonton and the City of Calgary. The intent of this coordinated effort was to support broader insight and assurance on the state of emergency preparedness in Alberta. ● The provincial report may restate the recommendations from the City of Edmonton Emergency Management Governance and Risk Assessment Audit , Attachment 1. The Office of the City Auditor found that the City lacks a formal process for preparing, reviewing and communicating its Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment. ● Administration accepted the Auditor’s recommendations as outlined within CR_7175 Administration Response - Emergency Management Governance and Risk Assessment Audit , Attachment 2, presented to Audit Committee on June 13, 2019. ● Implementation of the recommendations will promote a more robust Emergency Management Program and will build off the successes of re-established meetings and activities of the Emergency Management Agency and Emergency Advisory Committee. ● In light of the COVID-19 pandemic there is a heightened awareness of emergency management planning and this may lead to renewed interest from the public and media in Edmonton’s Emergency Management Program program and its Hazard Index and Risk Assessment process. The Emergency Management Agency is committed to implementing all of the Office of the City Auditor’s recommendations. Since the audit report was released, the Emergency Management Bylaw and the basic Municipal Emergency Plan have been updated and the strategic plan is approximately 50 percent complete. Updates to the Hazard Index and Risk Assessment have not yet begun. Due to operational priorities related to the City’s COVID-19 response, we have communicated to the Auditor that the original implementation timeline of December 20, 2020 may be delayed. Edmontonians should continue to be confident in the City’s Emergency Management program and in the City’s ability to minimize the risks to the health and property of all Edmontonians.

As part of the package, Global news received four traffic simulation animations from 2013 and an internal email stating that the traffic queuing has time to recover when the line is operating at 10 min frequencies, but that the intersections were “failing” at five minute frequencies. They are running a two-part series on this FOIP request today and tomorrow. 630 CHED has also asked for an interview. City of Edmonton Position: Traffic modelling is one of the tools that the City uses to inform our decision-making on projects that impact the mobility network. The modelling that Global received was developed in 2013 to support decision-making at that time and in isolation has limitations in terms of its accuracy to predict future traffic patterns and behaviours. Key Messages: ● The Metro Line is a key part of our mobility network’s long-term capacity, which would otherwise be limited in its ability to keep Edmontonians moving as we grow to a city of 2 million people. Expanding our LRT network may change wait times at some intersections, but it will help to reduce traffic congestion overall in the long run. ● This traffic modelling was completed in 2013 to help with our planning before the line opened. ● This traffic modelling was used as a tool for predicting travel patterns; we have continued to look at how traffic actually behaves and have made a number of adjustments to improve intersections since the Metro Line opened in 2015. ● We are continuing to look at ways to iterate and improve intersection performance in proximity to all LRT lines, and hope to make further tweaks to Metro Line intersections after our alternative signalling system is complete, which is anticipated by the end of the year. ● There are currently no plans to increase frequency on the Metro Line any time soon. Approach : The City provided an interview to Global News. We will monitor media coverage and further media inquiries on the issue, and will respond accordingly. Background: The traffic models in the FOIP release were developed in 2013 for planning purposes at the time and are outdated. Any “failures” in the model are theoretical; in reality, most intersections don’t reach the point where traffic volume can’t be accommodated in one green light cycle. However, increasing failures are likely at intersections across the City if we don’t build out a more robust mobility network to accommodate a million more people, including building an expanded LRT system. The City has no plans to move to 5-minute frequencies on the Metro Line any time soon. By the time we move to 5-minute frequencies, we expect to have extended the Metro Line to Campbell Road; have an advanced traffic network that includes expanded LRT; have upgraded freeways like Yellowhead and Terwillegar, and continuously improved and upgraded traffic signal technology. City Council approved the LRT Crossing Assessment Framework in 2017 after the Metro Line opened. The City used the framework to retroactively evaluate the intersection of 111 Avenue and 106 Street, and the results confirmed the decision to cross the intersection at street level.

Council’s vision for the community will be delivered by the Blatchford Redevelopment Office and the Blatchford Renewable Energy Utility. Vision: Blatchford will be home to up to 30,000 Edmontonians living, working and learning in a sustainable community that uses 100% renewable energy, is carbon neutral, significantly reduces its ecological footprint, and empowers residents to pursue a range of sustainable lifestyle choices. With Administration acting as the developer, and working hand in hand with our builders, Blatchford will be built in multiple stages over a number of years. We are currently in the initial stages of development with a significant amount of planning, design, engineering and construction work already completed. Housing Market The real estate market in Edmonton has been challenging over the last several years. New home sales activity in Edmonton has been impacted by both historic low oil prices as well as by the pandemic. Even during this challenging market, Blatchford has continued to receive interest and commitment from a number of builders that believe in the vision for the community and are wanting to join us in creating the sustainable community that Council envisions. Our first four builders, Encore, Mutti, Ocheller and Carbon Busters, are currently in the process of designing and building townhome sites in Blatchford. Showing their creativity and commitment, our builder group is adjusting to the new challenges and have reported multiple pre-sales of their units within Blatchford. Office of the Deputy City Manager Integrated Infrastructure Services Memorandum Planning, Engineering, and Construction The Blatchford office’s construction of Stage One is nearing completion, with crews currently finishing the landscaping of the park, boulevards and stormwater facility. Stage Two has received planning and engineering approval and we are intending to start grading work this fall with underground and surface improvements scheduled to begin in early 2021. Twenty-six fee-simple townhome lots in Stage Two were serviced at the same time as the Stage One lots, which will allow our builders to maintain their sales momentum and move right into construction once those lots are subdivided. NAIT has purchased 33 acres of land on the east side of the site. The planning and engineering work is on track to meet the servicing obligations of that agreement. The Metro LRT expansion is currently underway on the east side of the community. They are grading the site and have begun installing underground infrastructure. The NAIT servicing coupled with the LRT activity on the east side of Blatchford allows us to activate this side of the community, opening up more options and opportunities for future residential options. Land Sales We are excited to announce that Mutti Homes has provided October home possession dates for our first residents. The first homes being occupied are townhomes along Yorke Mews, which is a pedestrian-only street in the first stage of development. A media event to welcome the first residents is planned for October 21. Of the 12 parcels of land in Stage One, six are sold, three are pending and three are for sale. We have also had interest in Stage Two land from our current builder group as well as other external parties. There has also been increased interest over the last several months for land in the Blatchford Market (town centre) commercial area as well as land surrounding the future LRT stations. If market conditions allow, our plan is to have this area activated with development underway when the LRT is operational. This aligns with the next phase of the District Energy Sharing System, which is planned for the Blatchford Market area. Office of the Deputy City Manager Integrated Infrastructure Services Memorandum As the land developer, we continue to seek builders for the remaining land in Stage One and are planning to release Stage Two land for sale shortly. We will continue to engage potential builders through a number of strategies, including tours, presentations, real estate listing services, etc. We anticipate that the completion of the Stage One land development construction and the first residents moving in will play a significant role in supporting the land sales work. Stage One Map Builder Update In addition to completing construction of their firs","t townhomes for resident occupancy, three of our builders are planning to open show suites the next few months. While pre-sales have been steady, the builders are anticipating an increase in sales activity once they have an on-site presence with the show suites. Office of the Deputy City Manager Integrated Infrastructure Services Memorandum The existing builders have indicated they are interested in continuing on in Blatchford and it is our intention to move forward with them as part of a builder group. Having a builder group and expecting more sales activity with show suites open is typical of any new community. Financial Update Blatchford land sales and construction has progressed at a slower pace compared to the original business plan for a variety of reasons; however, we are trending in alignment with the approved budget from 2014. To the end of June 2020, we have spent $161.2M in Blatchford. This amount includes costs associated with the following: 1. Land acquisition and related assembly costs 2. Costs associated with closing and demolishing the airport. 3. Demolition and remediation cost for the land that encompasses the first stage of development. 4. Construction costs for the installation of underground and surface servicing for Stage One. 5. Planning, Engineering, and Marketing efforts to support preparing construction and land sales. Land development requires significant up front costs, with a significant portion of the budget spent to date on the one-time servicing costs. Since the business plan was approved in 2014 to the end of June 2020, we have realized $15.4M in revenue. This amount includes both lease and land sales revenue. The anticipated amount generated from land sales is aligned with that anticipated in the 2014 business plan. Public Interest Blatchford was recently selected as the winner of a Federation of Canadian Municipalities Award in the Neighbourhoods category. This category recognizes innovative approaches completed at the neighbourhood or community scale, where the initiative is improving sustainability in the following sectors: energy, water, waste and transportation. The Blatchford office continues to present to various interested groups, including from the sustainability community, urban planners and the building industry. We also continue to be approached by other municipalities as well as educational institutions that are interested in the project. Blatchford will be a landmark development for the City of Edmonton and we look forward to continuing to share our story locally, nationally and globally.

The City of Edmonton will follow and share the tips along with other public health guidelines for events and gatherings to help ensure Edmontonians have a safe and enjoyable Halloween. The City may make changes to its approach to Halloween at any time based on active case rates, hospitalizations and ICU capacity. DR. WILBERT MCINTYRE PARK CAMP & CAMP PEKIWEWIN On September 27, the organizer of the Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park encampment relocated the camp to Light Horse Park, approximately 200 metres to the north. This contravened a previous agreement with the City for the camp organizers to voluntarily close the camp. Camp Pekiweein organizers have expressed plans to “winterize” their encampment and hosted a fundraiser on September 30 to support this effort. Recent social media content reveals that the organizers of the Pekiwewin encampment have begun to construct wooden structures and add hay bales at the site. Today Administration discussed options for temporarily sheltering people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic at a Special City Council meeting. LOCAL ECONOMY The Local Economy (LE) One-on-One Support Program received 20 new applications and the program has now surpassed the total number of applications for all of last year with 596 applications to date in 2020 and 590 applications in 2019. The patio program has now supported 110 temporary patios across with three new registrants in September. We have notified local businesses that the City Operations team will be removing the temporary traffic control (if applicable) for patios the week of October 26-31. Businesses choosing not to operate a temporary COVID-19 cases by month for Canada COVID-19 cases by month for Alberta New EERG social media is ready to roll 17(1) winter patio should make plans to take down their temporary extended patio by that time. Businesses have also been notified that Administration is reviewing a winter patios proposal and the City is examining considerations for continued temporary patio operatio","o operations until March 31, 2021. Considerations will include pedestrian safety around the patio, snow and ice removal, installation of structures, tents, windbreaks, etc., and use of public property. Businesses that are interested in operating a winter patio have been asked to contact the Local Economy Team as soon as possible with their interest. The Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG) Program City Stream for individual business now accepts applications on an ongoing basis, instead of only on Mondays. The Local Economy Team will continue to evaluate and disburse funds on a weekly basis. This change has received positive feedback from businesses and the team has received a number of new applications as a result. The team has confirmed new social media advertising for the City Stream and is expanding its outreach program to inform local business groups about the continued availability of grant opportunities. These actions are focused on increasing the awareness of EERG with the business community. This week the Local Economy Team signed the first Business Association Stream agreement with Oliver Exchange Ltd. and the agreement is currently with Finance to issue funding. The team also anticipates signing two additional agreements as early as next week for a collaborative project between Business Link and the BIAs, and for the Digital Mainstreet project. Two BIAs and an arts group have also expressed interest in applying to the program (Chinatown BIA and French Quarter BIA, and the Quarters Arts group). SHARED STREETS: Shared Streets will be gradually removed between October 27 and early November. Lane closures will be removed between September 29 and the last week of October. See edmonton.ca/streets for a full list of the removals. A number of lessons were learned through the Shared Streets and lane closures implemented in 2020, including confirming (through a partnership study with the University of Alberta ) how they positively impacted individuals' abilities to physically distance. These experiences have provided many considerations that will be explored further when looking at opportunities for 2021. EDMONTON VALLEY ZOO: For the week of September 20-27 the Edmonton Valley Zoo saw 5,160 reservations filled of 9,800 available for a fill rate of 53%. Since opening, 104,817 reservations have been filled of 143,290 available (73%). To date, 2,662 visitor surveys have been completed with an Shared streets to be removed for winter Edmonton Valley Zoo sells out sixteen times so far! 17(1) overall satisfaction rating of 85% and a 90% satisfaction rating for COVID-19 safety measures.

OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES & INFORMATION EDMONTON GIVES: The Edmonton Gives webpage was introduced as a way to connect Edmontonians to community organizations involved in COVID-19 response efforts by leveraging website traffic on edmonton.ca . This aligned well with other communication and community support efforts undertaken at the time, and provided a valuable way to communicate the needs of not-for-profits, as well as share stories of generosity and community mindedness taking place during the pandemic. It was also identified that in creating this initiative there was an opportunity to develop a webpage that could not only support the current pandemic, but could be used on an ongoing basis or be activated in times of other crises. Edmonton Gives site becomes an indexed resource The Edmonton Gives project team has continued to explore improvements to the site, including updated layout, design, and structure. As such, a simplified Edmonton Gives webpage, listing all resources in an index as opposed to on separate pages, has been developed. This updated page has an easier to navigate layout, shows a better representation of the scope and purpose of Edmonton Gives, links to the Transforming Edmonton blog , and has an index of resources. These improvements allow for the web page to be managed and reported on in the same manner as other COVID pages on edmonton.ca, with External Relations providing occasional updates on an as-needed basis. The Edmonton Gives page will continue to leverage web traffic by encouraging visitors to donate to, or connect with charitable organizations and not-for-profit organizations. ENCAMPMENTS: From September 22-28, the Encampment Response Team received 146 calls for service from 311 and other internal agencies. 43 occupied or vacant encampments were cleaned of debris by City Operations and another 23 were referred to City Operations for removal. A remaining 114 encampment files require investigation and 33 known camps are currently being monitored. There have been 92 encampment files closed. To date in 2020, the team has received 3,572 calls for service with 3,320 encampment files investigated and closed. VEHICLE NOISE: Since April 24, 2020, there have been 536 hours allocated to noise enforcement with 146 fines issued and 12 joint operations conducted from May 22 - September 12. The vehicle noise pilot is active and officers are using the mobile meters as part of their data analytics to help target enforcement. The noise machines are being moved to additional locations looking to collect data on other areas reported as concerns by the public. The report has been requested to be delayed until the end of the year as the pilot needed an additional month to gather and analyze the data to ensure a strong analysis of the program. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided updated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. The Provincial Collective Impact Initiative to Address Domestic Violence in Alberta has begun work on the Primary Prevention Framework to Address Domestic and Sexual Violence. The framework will address key social and economic determinants of domestic and sexual violence and support current provincial momentum in a consolidated and sustained way through evidence-informed policy, coordinated action and appropriate resource allocation. Phase 1, focused on research and key stakeholder engagement, will take place from now until December 2021. MEN Edmonton (Men’s Engagement Network) will be fundraising for WIN House by having a virtual watch party of “Crazy, Stupid, Love” on October 8 . They will explore how the film portrays (un)healthy relationships and gender roles, how we interpret these messages, and what they mean for the larger society. TRANSIT: Bus-only transit ridership for the week of September 20-26 was 779,428 weekday passenger boardings. Compared to last week transit observed 1.4% less ridership. This represents a 50% ridership recovery this week as compared to the same week in 2019. A Public Service Announcement was issued today with an October Ride Transit Program pass update.

Due to anticipated processing delays, and with the majority of passes being mailed through Canada Post, some participants are still waiting to receive their October pass. To ensure access to transit, ETS will be extending the expiration date of September Ride Transit Program passes to October 8 to allow more time for customers to receive their October pass. When boarding a bus, the Transit Operator may ask discreetly to see the front and back of the September pass to verify if they are a Ride Transit participant (there are unique codes on the back of the pass that identify their enrollment).

Zoning Bylaw Omnibus 2020 Amendments - Bold Moves and Clean-ups The Zoning Bylaw Omnibus 2020 Amendments presents both minor clean-up amendments - such as corrections of minor errors and typographical omissions - and big moves - such as allowing garden suites in more locations and expanding the number of instances where Development Permits are not required (i.e. commercial change of use, basement interior developments, decks). Developed in the context of a global pandemic of COVID-19 and unprecedented economic conditions, the proposed text amendments reimagine how Administration can more quickly and effectively realize some of the City Plan’s city building outcomes, while supporting businesses impacted by the COVID-19 situation. These changes will be presented at Urban Planning Committee on October 27, 2020. Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative The Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative will develop a strategic, simplified and streamlined Zoning Bylaw to enable people, places and businesses to thrive and prosper. The initiative is a multi-year comprehensive overhaul of our current Zoning Bylaw that includes rethinking how, what and why the City regulates zoning and land development. Renewing Edmonton’s Zoning Bylaw provides the opportunity to align our city-building tools from strategy to regulation and ensure all Edmontonians and property owners have the necessary tools to build the city envisioned in ConnectEdmonton and as described in The City Plan. The Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative report #2 is being prepared for presentation at Urban Planning Committee in Q1 2021. The report will provide Committee and residents with an update on the Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative, including: ● An overview of work completed since the last report 1 ● A What We Are Hearing summary on engagement ● The initiative’s next steps. Open Option Parking On June 23, 2020, City Council approved changes to the Zoning Bylaw to allow Open Option Parking city-wide. Council also passed a motion for Administration to examine the impacts of how shared parking has affected communities, like those around the University of Alberta, Commonwealth Stadium, Rogers Place, and other high demand parking areas, and return with recommendations on amendments, if necessary. A report will be presented at the same time to Urban Planning Committee as the Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative Report #2. Next steps Should you wish to connect on any of these items I would be pleased to meet with you at your convenience.

T he Reimagine report outlines specific recommendations to guide the Reimagine Services work: reduce and eliminate services; evaluate private-sector alternatives; create digital solutions, prioritize data; and complete a GBA+ analysis on future actions. Much like the Program and Service Reviews which focus on relevance, efficiency and effectiveness, Reimagine Services will prioritize value for money to make targeted, concrete cost-savings recommendations, clearly articulating trade-offs and impacts. However, we will follow a different internal circulation and approval process. To ensure transparency and provide progress updates, meetings with various Deputy City Managers and our union partners will occur as the work unfolds. We are committed to an ongoing dialogue to ensure we understand their perspectives on the difficult choices ahead. To narrow the focus to five of the City’s biggest services, a prioritization scorecard was developed to score and rank all 73 City services on cost-savings potential and relevance. Through this analysis we found that the five big services are: ● Fleet Management and Maintenance; ● Facilities Management and Maintenance; ● Recreation and Sport Facilities Access/Recreation and Culture Programming; ● Parks and Open Spaces; and ● Fire Rescue Services. To provide an arms-length, evidence based and expedited review of the City’s five big services, in early September a Request for Project Services for an external consultant was released. Proposals were received on September 21, 2020 and are currently being reviewed. We plan to have the consultant contract finalized by the beginning of October and anticipate having recommendations to reimagine these services developed for the end of Q2, 2021. This fall, recommendations from past Program and Service Reviews will be brought forward through Supplemental Operating and Capital Budget Adjustments as one-time budget reductions to offset the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing budget reduction strategies.

That Administration provide a memo to Members of Council before October 5, 2020 including a range of costs to waive 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the fees within Vehicle For Hire Bylaw 17400, for dispatch and vehicle licences. That Community and Public Services Committee recommend to City Council: 1. That the fees within Vehicle For Hire Bylaw 17400, for dispatch and vehicle licences, be waived by 50 percent. 2. That the fees within Vehicle For Hire Bylaw 17400, for dispatch and vehicle licenses for limousines be waived by 100 percent. Contributions are made to the Vehicle for Hire Reserve when annual revenue is greater than operating expenses. The Vehicle for Hire Reserve was established to accumulate annual program surpluses and offset annual program deficits. The recent growth in the Vehicle for Hire Reserve balance is primarily due to Transportation Network Company per trip fees and accessibility surcharge. As of August 31, 2020, the Vehicle for Hire Reserve balance was $2,194,000 and while the general reserve policy does not outline a required reserve minimum balance, best practice contends that a reserve should maintain a minimum balance of thirty percent of annual operating expenses. For Vehicle for Hire, this equates to approximately $600,000. Vehicle for Hire program teams, which support services and enforcement of the Vehicle for Hire Bylaw, are paid from program revenues. These teams include the Licensing Service team, Vehicle for Hire policy team and the Community Standards Peace Officers. Under the baseline scenario with no fee waiving, the 2021 forecasted Vehicle for Hire Reserve balance is $1,098,000. The following table details impacts to the Vehicle for Hire Reserve in seven scenarios for dispatcher and vehicle licence fee waive: ● (1a) Twenty-five percent for all dispatchers, ● (1b) Fifty percent for all dispatchers, ● (1c) Seventy-five percent for all dispatchers, ● (1d) One hundred percent for all dispatchers, ● (2a) Twenty-five percent for all dispatchers and one hundred percent for Limousines, ● (2b) Fifty percent for all dispatchers and one hundred percent for Limousine dispatch, and ● (2c) Seventy-five percent for all dispatchers and one hundred percent for Limousine dispatch. Scenario % of Fees Waived - Dispatch and Vehicle Licences % of Fees Waived - Limousine Licences Financial Impact 2020 Forecast VFH Reserve Balance 2021 Forecast VFH Reserve Balance Baseline 0 0 $0 $1,709,000 $1,098,000 1a 25 25 $205,000 $1,665,000 $893,000 1b 50 50 $411,000 $1,628,000 $687,000 1c 75 75 $614,000 $1,579,000 $484,000 1d 100 100 $822,000 $1,547,000 $276,000 2a 25 100 $300,000 $1,646,000 $798,000 2b 50 100 $473,000 $1,610,000 $625,000 2c 75 100 $645,000 $1,573,000 $453,000 The Vehicle for Hire Reserve also holds the balance of contributions from the accessible surcharge fee for dispatchers without accessible vehicles. As of August 31,2020, $161,000 of the Vehicle for Hire Reserve balance is from accessible surcharge fees. Administration is committed to advancing accessible service strategies. In a recent engagement with Accessible Advisory Committee members, concerns regarding potential loss of focus on accessible service strategies were raised and requested a matched amount from the Vehicle for Hire Reserve be committed to support industry in providing accessible service.

In addition, Administration meets with Alberta Health Services/Health Zone Emergency Operations Center (ZEOC) three times a week to discuss the epidemiology of cases in the Edmonton Zone. At today’s meeting, Dr. Sikora, Edmonton’s Medical Officer of Health, was accompanied by Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, who expressed concerns related to the escalating case numbers in Edmonton. There are currently 982 active cases in the Edmonton Zone which brings the active case rate to 87.5/100K. As part of today’s conversation, a number of ideas were put forward for measures to help manage the number of cases in Edmonton. Administration was asked to provide input for consideration. The below feedback was provided to the Zone Emergency Operations Center Director this afternoon: The City of Edmonton’s Administration strongly support the following approaches: 1. A collaborative communications approach between AHS/AB Health and the City on targeting user social groups, cohorts, communities, businesses and geographical areas experiencing outbreaks 2. A mandatory reduction approach in social cohort numbers, gatherings, and frequency 3. A mandatory reduction approach to threshold numbers for both indoor and outdoor gatherings 4. A strong recommendation to consider limiting seasonal social gatherings, such as thanksgiving dinner, to members of individual household 5. Strong support for ‘Work from Home’ strategies for businesses across Edmonton 6. Strong support for travel restrictions outside Edmonton/Alberta for non-essential reasons Administration continues to look at our own Workplace Reintegration and ‘Remote Work Program’ strategies, travel policies and continued messaging to employees on adhering to COVID-19 health and safety protocols. We will continue to make any adjustments as needed. We have an Emergency Advisory Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday, October 15, and we can provide an update at that meeting. We will be in touch if additional measures or information becomes available before then. AL/tl",,"No",,,

THANKSGIVING Alberta Health is encouraging Albertans to keep their Thanksgiving gatherings as small as possible. Online guidance is available to help Albertans enjoy a safe and healthy holiday while limiting the spread of COVID-19. Connected Neighbours messaging has been circulated to Council to share on social media to help remind Edmontonians to follow guidelines for social gatherings during the Thanksgiving long weekend. TEMPORARY ENCAMPMENTS On October 5, the City announced a plan for temporary pandemic accommodation this winter. The City is concerned for the safety and well-being of those sleeping rough, including those living in temporary encampments. The City will be using a City-owned facility to provide temporary, 24-7 accommodation with day programming and meal service until March 2021. A Transforming Edmonton blog was also shared with more details and the location of the new facility is expected to be publicly announced by the City tomorrow. The City will be working closely with social service agencies and business associations to ensure the transition to temporary pandemic accommodation is respectful and the needs of all stakeholders are taken into consideration.

The total number of temporary patio registrations is 111, with one new registration in the last week. This week the City confirmed that it will be supporting a winter patio program. Given the logistical and safety challenges that come with winter - snow and ice removal, increased slipping hazards, reduced visibility - the Local Economy Team will work with each business that wants to remain open on a case-by-case basis. There are three paths for businesses in the upcoming months and over winter: ● A business may choose to take down their patios for the winter by November 6 ● A businesses may choose to set out tables and chairs on nice weather days, maintain 2m of pedestrian space on the sidewalk and sign a second declaration that extends their temporary patio to March 31, 2021 ● Businesses wanting to set up a semi-permanent patio until March 31 will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if their plan is feasible, whether they require permits or a licence of occupation, or if the Local Economy Team needs to work with them on alternative solutions. The Edmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG) Program has launched a new communications campaign across City social media platforms to promote the City Stream. This week, we have sent the first grant payment for the Business Association Stream, to Oliver Exchange.

On the morning of Tuesday October 6, Joe Zatylny, Fire Chief, Russell Croome, Deputy Fire Chief, Kim Petrin, Branch Manager Development Services and Chad Rich, Safety Codes Officer, visited Camp Pekewewin to visually review the structure erected by camp organizers as it was built on City owned land without our permission or required permits. In the spirit of a collaborative approach, the team waited to be greeted by people from the camp before entering the site, let them know why they were there, and waited to be guided to the structure. This approach was applied even though the City is under no obligation to provide notice when entering City owned land. From this safety assessment, it was determined that no portion of this structure aligns with minimum building code requirements and therefore the City cannot sanction the structure as safe for use. The City’s primary focus remains safety of occupants and citizens. When this information was communicated during the inspection and at a follow up meeting later that morning the Camp Organizers who were present communicated to the City that the structure would be voluntarily removed in the following days and roped-off to prevent access during this time. The City offered to bring in fencing or contractors to assist with the demolition; however the camp organizers declined and thought it best to remove the structure themselves. The willingness of these organizers to voluntarily remove this unsafe structure without conflict was a gesture of good faith that was recognized and welcomed with optimism from the City. In an email sent on October 7th, and in social posts on Instagram, the camp organizers communicated that they will not remove the structure as per this original agreement. The safety concerns raised by the City on October 6th still stand, as does our request for this structure to be removed. The City would like to note that all construction and development in the City requires proper permits. Camp Pekiwewin does not have a legal entitlement to place a structure of any kind on this property. The City has not provided permission for this structure or any other structure to be erected and we temporarily delayed further action when a voluntary resolution was agreed to with organizers from the camp earlier this week. We have reiterated our request to the Camp Organizers that the structure be removed by October 15, 2020 . If they need assistance in completing this work, we have invited them to contact the City. The City will provide a new structure on-site on the same day as the removal of the existing one to use temporarily for safe food storage and storage of other articles. This will address the organizer’s storage needs in a much safer manner than the current situation and will be removed when the campers transition to other shelter locations in a few weeks. This resolution, if accepted by the organizers of the camp, will allow us to shift our focus back to working towards our shared goal to provide everyone in the camp with a warm place to sleep before winter and connect them with pathways to housing in the short, medium and long term.

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton and located in the Westmount Architectural Heritage Area. Built in 1922, the Woodward Residence is a modest bungalow which is significant for its Craftsman Style design influences and association with residential development in Westmount during the Post First World War recession. Residences built during this period were generally smaller in scale than those built during the economic boom that preceded the First World War in Edmonton. While the Woodward Residence retains a high degree of architectural integrity it is in generally poor condition. The property owner has been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the Woodwards Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource. However, they have indicated they are not interested in retaining the residence. The property owner has satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality with the authority to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. 1 c: Executive Leadership Team Kim Petrin, Branch Manager, Development Services Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

At our budget adjustment discussions in November we will present: ● Recommended budget reduction strategies (on-going) to limit the tax increase for 2021 to 0%; Results from the Priority Based Budgeting (Limited Scope) exercise for both operating services and capital projects based on the motion made by Council at its May 25th meeting; and ● An update on the financial impact and funding strategy as a result of COVID-19, with one-time budget recommendations to offset related budget impacts to follow. The process and timing of COVID-19 related 2021 one-time budget adjustments is still being determined. As you recall significant budget adjustments were made in the spring to manage the effects of COVID-19 on the City’s 2020 operating budget. Even after these one-time adjustments, our latest projections show that there will be an additional $23.8 million tax-supported deficit mainly as a result of the pandemic. Administration continues to manage spending in order to reduce the year-end COVID-19 budget shortfall and will present the final budget shortfall in the year-end preliminary reporting in Q1 of 2021 along with a funding strategy. In order to reduce strain on the property tax base and ensure a fair and equitable distribution of costs across residents, businesses and properties, we are exploring strategies to ensure appropriate cost recovery levels for all revenue-generating, tax supported and regulatory services. 1 At the October 16, 2020 Executive Committee meeting we will present reports on revenue generation, cost recovery and tax tools and will outline a new fiscal policy for revenue generation to ground Council discussions on cost allocation. The fiscal policy for revenue generation will provide a starting point for Council to explore “ who pays for what, in what amount, and why ?” Moving forward we will enhance our ongoing financial viability by right-sizing our asset holdings. Administration is also progressing work to review our land, property and facility assets, re-evaluate our land development projects against market factors and evaluate market supply in the context of competition with City projects and alignment with The City Plan. Updates on this review will be brought forward to Council throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021, with recommendations being made through future supplemental budget adjustments, and possibly even the fall 2020 supplemental budget adjustment process.

Outdoor Litter Program Review Waste Services conducted an Outdoor Litter Program Review during 2020. The review consisted of a benchmarking analysis, consultation with other Canadian municipalities and City staff, and a review of 311 complaints data. Based on the analysis, i t was determined that the total l itter container numbers and density of the existing outdoor l itter program (on-street and i n parks and open spaces) i s extensive and well distributed across the city. Analysis and Findings Summary There are 4,800 on-street l itter containers l ocated i n key commercial areas, along priority walking corridors of communities and bus stops. There are over 6,700 l itter containers i n the river valley, district and neighbourhood parks and various open space amenities such as playgrounds, spray parks, picnic areas, trails, stormwater ponds, etc. Litter container servicing frequency ranges from daily to biweekly depending on pedestrian traffic, use patterns and volume of container. The benchmarking analysis found that both the City’s on-street and open space l itter container program i s above average when compared to other Canadian cities. Edmonton has more than twice the on-street l itter containers as compared to Calgary; and nearly 50 percent more open space l itter containers per hectare of maintained parkland as compared to the median value for 14 Canadian municipalities. For example, Edmonton would have 2,100 l ess parks and open space l itter containers i f we met the median density value (Attachment 1). Consultation with i nternal City staff and other municipalities found that strategic l itter can placement or removal may minimize opportunities for i llegal dumping of household waste, yard waste and commercial waste by i ndirectly supporting behaviour change. Other major Canadian cities provide consistent container placement standards that emphasize ease of access and cost efficient servicing over availability and accessibility for users. Calgary and Toronto avoid or minimize placing l itter .../2 Office of the Deputy City Manager CITY OPERATIONS Memorandum November 30, 2020 Reference No. 379252544-001 To: City Council Executive Leadership Team From: Gord Cebryk, P . Eng. Deputy City Manager Subject: Outdoor Litter Program Review and Litter Reduction Efforts -2- containers on turf or i n l ocations that require off-roading, whereas Edmonton has thousands of parks and open space l itter containers that require off-road access. The 311 data review, which covered complaints between January 2018 and August 2020 (32 month period), found over 15,000 complaints related to l itter found on all surfaces. The 20 neighbourhoods that had the highest number of l itter complaints were all l ocated close to the downtown core. The majority of these neighbourhoods already had relatively high l itter container coverage. During the 32 month period, there were a total of 2,500 complaints made related to overfilled on-street and open space l itter containers. The 20 neighbourhoods with the highest number of complaints ranged from 0.75 to 2.64 complaints per month. For example, the downtown area, with a coverage of 490 on-street l itter containers, received l ess than one complaint per week. The average number of complaints across all neighbourhoods was 0.22 per complaint per neighbourhood per month. The conclusion from the complaints analysis i s that outdoor l itter containers are generally being serviced at an appropriate frequency (Attachment 2). Next Steps Based on the analysis and findings from the Outdoor Litter Program Review, Administration commits to do the following during 2021: ➔ Continue to expand and l everage social partnerships to i mplement targeted tactics to address l itter hotspots, as per the July memo to Council (Attachment 3). ➔ Enhance l itter container servicing efficiency by setting consistent placement and servicing standards; develop potential cost reduction scenarios by the third quarter of 2021. ➔ As part of the 25-year Waste Strategy corporate waste program i mplementation: - Expand two stream sorting (garbage and recycling) and i ntroduce three stream sorting (garbage, recycling and food scraps/organics) i n priority outdoor commercial areas, par","parks and open spaces. - Introduce public messaging and education on proper use of the residential program and the outdoor l itter containers to help contribute to our community’s 90 percent residential waste diversion goal.

Maintaining a safe and livable winter mobility network is the primary focus of the Snow and Ice Control program. This year, Parks and Roads Services has introduced several service enhancements to improve the snow clearing experience. Enhancements made to the Snow and Ice Control program this year include: ● Blading residential roads more frequently to improve conditions between snow events, ● Implementing a citywide parking ban, as required by conditions. To inform and assist Councillors and their offices with public inquiries and help facilitate understanding, a redesigned, comprehensive 2020-21 Snow and Ice Control Council Binder has been developed. This information resource includes: ● At-a-glance, “What’s new this year” documents for high level information, ● Overhauled, simplified content, including updates to key information and statistics, ● Comprehensive, redeveloped Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). We look forward to meeting with your offices later this week and next, and continuing the dialogue around improvements, parking bans, and more throughout the winter season.

In an 8-minute news conference that included some media questions, the House Leader highlighted legislation on the following topics: ● Geothermal ● Innovation and employment incentives ● Another red tape bill ● Legislation to address contractor services ● Child care ● Justice and victim services In total, Mr. Nixon said there will be 20 pieces of legislation. There will also be a special debate on economic recovery. He did not explicitly name any legislation that involves the municipal sector, but he did not provide a complete list of all legislation, nor is such a list provided in the Government of Alberta News Release, so it remains to be seen whether any of the legislation will have an impact on the City of Edmonton. Assessment Model Review Update Minister Tracy Allard also announced new supports for the energy industry in an effort to bolster the recovery of the province's economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. The supports are intended to attract investments and jobs and ensure long term viability of municipalities and the oil and gas sector. 2 The province introduced a three-year property tax exemption for energy companies drilling new wells or building new pipelines and eliminated the well drilling equipment tax for new drills. The four scenarios previously contemplated during an earlier review of the assessment model would have had an impact of 7% to 20% reduction in revenues for municipalities. Those scenarios are now paused. During a question and answer session with journalists, the Minister indicated that now is not a good time to go into the level of changes previously contemplated, and she committed to an open and transparent consultation with stakeholders over the next three years. According to the Minister, ""the [previous] conversations were well-intentioned but misplaced.... it's not about the what, but the how"". While the Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) acknowledged that the changes are smaller compared to what was previously contemplated by the province, the association's members continue to view unpaid taxes as the #1 advocacy challenge. Industry stated that today's announcement is not to be viewed as a tax break, but an interim measure towards correcting the flaws with the current model.

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. The Imperial Building property was acquired by the City of Edmonton as part of the West Valley LRT expansion, necessitating the demolition of the building (among others on the same blockface). City Council was previously made aware of these circumstances in report CR_5845 Valley Line West LRT - Impact on Heritage Homes and Trees on June 18, 2018. The Imperial Building, constructed in 1956, is valued as a physical link to the development of locally-based financial services in what was the former Town of Jasper Place and for providing valued office space for medical professionals and commercial businesses for the community. The improved economic position of Edmonton in the late 1920s and the later start of the Great Depression were two factors that instigated settlement of the land west of Edmonton’s city limits, including in the Jasper Place area. Land outside the city’s limits was cheaper and taxes were lower, making the available land attractive to Edmonton residents and business, as well as new immigrants who could not afford the costs of the city. Following the end of the Second World War, the area’s population boomed with returning soldiers, Post-war immigration, military land grants, and nearby oil strikes. As the population grew, the Village of West Jasper Place was formed in 1949, and incorporated as the Town of Jasper Place the following year. The formalization of what had been a collection of subdivisions into a Town initiated the establishment of a range of essential services such as a Town Hall, fire protection, as well as health services. These were strategically placed on Stony Plain Road. However, even with its growing population and the establishment of numerous institutions in the town, most residents still had to travel to Edmonton for financial and banking services, until the Canadian Bank of Commerce opened up the first bank branch in the new town in 1950. The Imperial Bank of Canada 1 opened their first branch in the extant building in 1956. The Imperial Building was constructed for Joseph Starko, an optometrist, and others, who considered the building as both an investment and site for centralization of medical offices in the community. When completed, the building housed not only the Imperial bank, but also a range of professional medical offices (dentist, optometrists) as well as a restaurant (Frontier Supper Club and Coffee Shop). It provided locally based services to the residents of Jasper Place. The Imperial Bank of Canada merged with the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1961, forming the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, this newly formed institution continued to operate from the extant building until the branch was closed on April 12, 1986. The Imperial Building is further significant as an example of a Modern-style building in Canora reflective of institutional architecture of the 1950s. The Modern architecture of the Imperial Building is evident in its reinforced concrete construction, flat roof, second floor curtain wall of glazing punctuated with awning-style windows, projecting eaves shading second floor windows, anodized aluminum fenestration, terrazzo wall panels on the first floor, and overall lack of exterior ornamentation. The Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800 have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Heritage Conservation team. Providing all other permit conditions are satisfied, Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development will issue the permit within one week. c: Executive Leadership Team Kim Petrin, Branch Manager, Development Services Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

Indoor social gatherings, such as house parties, birthday parties and wedding receptions, will be limited to no more than 15 people (reduced from 50 people.) This mandatory restriction will be in effect for one month and will then be reassessed. This restriction does not apply to outdoor events, indoor worship gatherings, or businesses, restaurants, cafes, etc., where the existing guidelines continue to apply. This information must remain confidential until Dr. Hinshaw's announcement this afternoon. This change is a result of the continued rise in COVID-19 case numbers in Edmonton. Currently, there are 1751 active cases which brings the active case rate to 142.2/100K. Please note that due to the dynamic nature of testing and reporting, the best source of current information is the Alberta Health website . My office continues to be in regular contact with AHS, including Dr. Chris Sikora, Medical Officer of Health for the Edmonton Zone and we will look at additional health measures if required. We will be in touch if additional measures or information becomes available before our next Emergency Advisory Committee meeting. AL/tl",,"No",,,

The topics of these discussion papers are: ● Signs ● Notifications and Variances ● Open Space and Civic Services Zones ● Residential Zones The discussion papers present the preliminary thinking on these topics and are intended to generate discussion on the proposed approach to the Zoning Bylaw’s regulatory framework. Stakeholders, industry, special interest groups and the general public have until November 13 to review the papers on Engaged Edmonton . Participants can provide feedback on the proposed regulatory approach and the associated tradeoffs through a survey and share ideas on a forum. Residential Zones Discussion Paper Administration anticipates that the Residential Zones discussion paper will receive more attention than the others. Over one million people already call Edmonton home. For those that do, their neighbourhoods are very near and dear to them. In order to achieve the objectives set out in The City Plan and ConnectEdmonton, the way we welcome and provide housing to new residents, as well as our built environment will change. The Residential Zones discussion paper articulates how the new Zoning Bylaw’s residential zones can support the ongoing growth and evolution of neighbourhoods, make it easier for residents to access housing, allow people to access more services and amenities close to where they live, and help build complete communities. To achieve these objectives, the discussion paper proposes to reduce the number of zones controlling residential development and to allow each zone to cover a wider range of housing forms. 1 Our current Zoning Bylaw contains a lot of residential zones that are very similar to one another, which creates both redundancy and complexity in the Zoning Bylaw without providing much additional opportunity in each zone. Rather than continuing to regulate based on multiple residential uses (e.g., single detached house, semi-detached housing, rowhouse, etc), the discussion paper proposes to have one use - Residential - and to focus regulations more on the form and massing of the building, in addition to site planning considerations like amenity space. Collectively, these new approaches will allow for more housing choice for Edmontonians in more neighbourhoods across the city, while providing greater opportunity for Edmonton’s homebuilders to achieve the densities and infill targets of The City Plan. The changes proposed through the Residential Zones discussion paper represent Administration’s first attempt at reimagining how the new Zoning Bylaw can serve our existing and future residents with housing options for those of different means and in different stages of life. The ‘what’ that needs to be done has already been established through The City Plan. The ‘how’ is still a work in progress and is up for discussion. Next Steps The Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative will continue engaging with industry, stakeholders and the general public throughout the project. Feedback from the discussion papers will be presented as a part of an update report to Urban Planning Committee in early 2021. If you have questions on the Zoning Bylaw Renewal Initiative, please reach out to Livia Balone, Director of the initiative, by email at livia.balone@edmonton.ca, or by telephone at (780) 686-0212.

EDMONTON COVID-19 STATUS This week Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, a nnounced new mandatory i ndoor and outdoor l imits on social gatherings for both the City of Edmonton and the City of Calgary. Social gatherings such as house parties, birthday parties and wedding receptions are l imited to no more than 15 people. These mandatory restrictions will be reassessed i n one month. Edmonton physicians a re warning the l ocal healthcare system i s at a ""tipping point"" as the city faces record-high COVID-19 case counts and hospitalization rates. Edmonton now has an active case rate of 183 per 100,000 people. The Edmonton Health Zone has 2,245 active cases with 197 cases added i n the l ast 24 hours. The city of Edmonton has 1,870 active cases. 70 people are now i n hospital i n the Edmonton Zone with eight patients i n i ntensive care. The province i s reporting outbreaks at four acute care facilities, 12 l ong-term care facilities, eight supportive l iving homes, 12 businesses, shelters and other facilities, and two private gatheri","and two private gatherings. There are 31 school outbreaks (2-4 cases) i n Edmonton and 21 schools under watch (5+ cases). More information will be updated on the C ity of Edmonton COVID-19 Dashboard. Compliance with the temporary face covering bylaw continues to be strong. For the week of October 21 - 27 overall compliance was 96% with Edmonton Transit Service at 95% (LRT 87/Bus 96%), Vehicle For Hire at 100%, recreation facilities at 99%, and public i ndoor spaces at 97%. Between 900 -1000 Edmontonians have been housed since the beginning of the pandemic Edmonton will receive a $17.3-million i n federal government funding to provide new housing for those experiencing homelessness.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA: The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) Domestic Offender Crimes Section provided u pdated summary data on domestic violence occurrences. Work i s underway to i mplement the new provincial D isclosure to Protect Against Domestic Violence (Clare’s Law) Act: l egislation to help individuals by empowering them with i nformation about potentially dangerous partners. This i ncludes developing a support structure to respond to client requests related to a Clare’s Law i nquiry. A Social Services Advisory Working Group has been formed to think through some of the obstacles and barriers as i mplementation of the new provincial model evolves. A decision has been made that all applications will be done online through any technology device. Current target for i mplementation i s April 2021. Connect Care, which i s an electronic clinical i nformation system that supports patient care i n Alberta Health Services, i s i mplementing a universal assessment approach to i dentify clients and patients experiencing domestic violence. The system prompts service providers to assess every i nteraction with a client/patient, but an answer i s not mandatory. If the service provider i dentifies a domestic violence risk, an algorithm guides the service provider to i nquire, educate and refer as appropriate. The Community and Social Services Branch of the Government of Alberta will l ead the Family Violence Prevention Month campaign i n November, beginning with a Ministerial statement on November 1 or 2. The theme for the month i s the same as l ast year’s theme of “Where to Turn,” which will focus on raising awareness of available support and how people can get help.

The members of this team include: Colas Infrastructure Canada; Standard General Inc. (a local subsidiary of Colas); Parsons Inc.; Fast + EPP; Francl Architecture and Stantec. The City received compliant proposals that were within our project budget and selected the team with the lowest financial bid. The City will now enter into discussions with Marigold Infrastructure Partners and expects to reach financial close by the end of the year. Following financial close, Administration will execute the agreement. Design and construction on the project will begin in 2021, and is expected to take five to six years to complete. The City followed a rigorous , fair and competitive procurement process. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to design, build and partially finance the Valley Line West LRT project was issued on January 7, 2020. On March 13, 2020, the City shortlisted three proponent teams to participate in the Request for Proposals (RFP) phase of procurement. Proponents first provided technical submissions on August 18, 2020 to demonstrate their ability to meet the City’s technical requirements. All teams passed the technical evaluation, and were invited to submit a financial proposal on October 27, 2020. The team with the lowest financial bid was selected as the preferred proponent. Throughout the procurement phase, Administration followed the disclosure recommendations included in the Accountability, Transparency and Disclosure Framework previously accepted by Council, to ensure an appropriate level of public 1 access to information, while also protecting the City’s commercial interests. A third-party Fairness Monitor provided oversight of the procurement to ensure a fair process for each proponent. The City’s Procurement Due Diligence Committee has also reviewed and endorsed the process and recommendation. The City will publicly announce the preferred proponent in a news release tomorrow morning. For inquiries related to the procurement process, please contact: ● Kim Bachand, Senior Buyer Email: vlwprocurement@edmonton.ca All other inquiries can be directed to the LRT Projects Information Centre: ● Email: lrtprojects@edmonton.ca or call: 780-496-4874 (voicemail) Sincerely, BF 2",,"No",,,

As we await the conclusion of the 28 days appeal period (by November 24, 2020), I wanted to provide you with an update on the other pieces of work underway to reimagine city building. Reimagined City Building focuses on how the City will recover from the pandemic and the economic recession in accordance with the Big City Moves, implementing The City Plan, integrating the Corporate Business Plan and establishing targets with City Council. The City Plan is a part of a larger family of documents and processes that, together, represent Edmonton’s strategic planning framework. Taking direction from ConnectEdmonton, The City Plan will be implemented through the corporate business planning process, capital and operating budgets, ongoing performance measurement, and supported by strategic initiatives, including the Zoning Bylaw Renewal and other projects within the City. As we prepare to update our Business Plans in 2021 to reflect The City Plan implementation approach, we are considering: ● What have we had to change in our business model to respond to and recover from the impacts of COVID-19? This may include relaunch activities, emerging risk mitigations, and business continuity plans that are in effect. ● How do our recovery actions reflect the Big City Moves? ● How are our business areas delivering on the choices outlined in The City Plan? ● How will our business areas need to change to deliver on the measures and targets included in The City Plan? If supported by EMRB, we anticipate that the Charter Bylaw to enact The City Plan will receive its third reading by City Council in December. In the interim, we are continuing to explore the approach and identify current state gaps for measuring and monitoring The City Plan targets. Thank you for your continued support of our Reimagine work. Should you have any questions please let me know. AL/tl",,"No",,,

On October 1, 2020, City Council approved funding from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities‘ COVID-19 Community Response Fund for Vulnerable Populations to support Boyle Street Community Services in securing a hotel space that could provide rapid bridge accommodation for people in encampments, particularly those in Light Horse Park. The owner of the Economy Inn, located at 4009 Gateway Blvd NW, approached the City with an offer to provide space to allow for bridge accommodations for individuals experiencing homelessness, as a way of supporting the community and to receive financial relief during a very difficult time for the hotel industry. Boyle Street Community Services has finalized an agreement with the hotel to arrange for a set of rooms to be reserved for their clients and is working on a plan to transition people out of the Light Horse Park encampment. The timing of this transition has been impacted by a positive case of COVID-19 at the Light Horse Park encampment. The individual who tested positive is now in the Alberta Health Services isolation centre and Alberta Health Services is on-site at the park to test those remaining at the camp. Camp residents and some volunteers have been advised of the positive COVID-19 case. If negative test results are received for those that have been tested, pending guidance from Alberta Health Services, camp residents will move into the hotel. The building will continue to function as a hotel, with hotel staff on-site. Additional support workers are being hired to enhance existing operations and help clients succeed in this temporary bridge housing. Support workers will assist with guest management, meals, and ensuring individuals access the service abide by hotel policies as outlined in the finalized agreement to mitigate potential challenges for the facility and surrounding community. Clients will also be connected to a housing worker with the goal of transitioning out of the hotel and into permanent housing that works for them. This housing option will provide a bridge to permanent housing solutions for people who are sleeping outside.

No new health recommendations or direction have been provided by the province. Continued adherence to established guidelines, health and safety measures, support for face coverings and the close monitoring of local epidemiology i s essential. Administration has undertaken a review of i ts l ines of business i n the wake of rising case rates and i s i mplementing a number of changes and enhancements to reduce and prevent the spread of COVID-19 including: ● Where operationally feasible, minimize staff daily travel and access to multiple City sites to minimize possibility of transmission. ● Ensure all staff areas clearly i ndicate face coverings are required. Face coverings are required everywhere, except when seated at a workstation where 2m distancing can be maintained. ● Continue ticketed/reserved entry for recreation facilities to ensure proper controls (other providers in the region have discontinued time-ticketing and are allowing drop-in opportunities). ● Review/refresh signage at facilities to emphasize messaging such as “Stop. Do not enter i f sick.” ● Plexiglass barriers for arena hosts (staff that greet public/ teams, monitor spectator area l imits, and ensure visitors follow AHS protocols) are being i nstalled. ● Reinforce with recreation facility hosts the need to continue to ensure all spectators and all facility group users have completed health screening upon entry to facilities; continued promotion of “how to wear a mask/face covering” messaging and i nstruction; and monitor “mingling” of i ndividuals and cohorts on sports courts to ensure provincial guidance i s followed. ● Recreation facilities will continue to maintain enhanced aquatic protocols that exceed Alberta Health standards for l ane swim and aquafit (one per l ane) and we will not open steam rooms and saunas. ● The City will not open i ndoor playgrounds. ● Signage will be maintained on high-use outdoor staircases indicating “For everyone’s","ases indicating “For everyone’s safety, please do not use stairs for repetitive exercise” (25 of 286 sets of stairs). ● Outdoor recreation opportunities will be encouraged through increased winter programming and enhanced options to distance outdoors (e.g. more benches to put on skates). ● Parks and Roads will be doubling the number of Dynamic Message Boards with health and face covering messages. COVID-19 cases by month for Canada COVID-19 cases by month for Alberta Social gatherings continue to be a source of COVID-19 spread The Communications and Engagement Department i s working with regional and provincial counterparts to share strategies and tactics. It is preparing a safe gathering/communication plan for Christmas/New Year’s Eve and i s finalizing a marketing communications campaign. The goal will be to i nfluence Edmontonians - targeting l argely those aged 20 to 39 - to adhere to COVID-19 safety best practices around social gatherings during the winter months and i nto spring 2021. Community Standards and Neighbourhoods will stand up their dedicated task team enforcement unit once again and have assigned additional staff to the Alberta Health Services/Edmonton Police Service/Peace Officer strike team. There will be i ncreased Public Safety Compliance Team i nspections of bars and pubs. They will be targeting outreach to community l eagues, neighbourhood groups, seniors, etc. and l everaging the Abundant Community program to promote healthy and safe gatherings. They will be closely reviewing any l icensing or permitting of events and the potential for l arge gatherings. Edmonton Transit will enhance cleaning to workplaces and spaces and full service will be maintained i n support of distancing requirements. ETS will be providing support for a third party app that uses crowdsourcing i nformation to help avoid overcrowding and there will be continuing health and safety messaging at stations and terminals. We will also continue to l imit capacity at City Hall public meetings and ensure strict enforcement of registrations so only those that have signed up to speak i n-person i n advance are granted building access. NATIONAL COVID-19 STATUS Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, i ssued a statement today noting that there are 31,725 active cases across the country and data i ndicates daily averages of 3,234 new cases (October 29 - November 4). The number of people experiencing severe i llness continues to i ncrease with provincial and territorial data i ndicating an average of 1,175 people with COVID-19 being treated i n Canadian hospitals daily -- i ncluding 223 i n i ntensive care units -- and an average of 43 COVID-19-related deaths. Dr. Tam i s advising Canadians to avoid the “Three Cs” settings wherever possible; closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places, and close contact situations that can amplify spread of the virus. She i s also recommending that everyone wear a non-medical mask or face covering when spending time i ndoors with people from outside of their i mmediate household. SHELTERS / HOUSING Yesterday there were 349 unique i ndividuals who accessed the Edmonton Convention Centre for day services and 225 unique individuals who accessed the facility for overnight accommodation. In total, there have been approximately 800 unique i ndividuals who have accessed the facility. Current capacity for both overnight and day services i s 225 with the expectation that capacity will i ncrease tomorrow to 300. While the agencies operating the temporary accommodation are still hiring staff and working through the l ogistical challenges associated with startup, the operation has been running relatively well. The working committees for the temporary accommodation have already initiated meetings to ensure that the governance and oversight for the operation are in place to keep things running smoothly. Community plans have been developed for the Edmonton Convention Centre, Commonwealth Stadium and Mustard Seed 24/7 pandemic accommodation. These community plans have been developed to mitigate perceived and real i mpacts from 24/7 shelter operations and are an i ntegrated i nitiative across City Administration, EPS and social agencies serving the community. The community plans provide strategic and tactical considerations focused on the external environment around each l ocation that will contribute to community wellbeing, Individual wellbeing and asset preservation. The Commonwealth Stadium 24/7 community plan i ncludes additional community resources and amenities for users on site. The cost for these resources and amenities i s to be paid for by Hope Mission. The Government of Alberta has i ndicated they would provide additional financial support to Hope Mission to help cover these costs. Once confirmation on coverage of these extra costs has been received, Administration supports moving to 24/7 at the earliest opportunity. More i nformation on Edmonton homelessness i s available h ere TEMPORARY ENCAMPMENTS An encampment at Light Horse Park i s now closed. The City of Edmonton has been working with organizers to voluntarily and safely wind down the encampment and assist camp residents i n making a smooth transition to alternate accommodations. This morning Peace Officers and outreach workers with Boyle Street Community Services were at Light Horse Park to assist those who were still at the site. Camp residents were screened for COVID-19 symptoms by outreach workers and as a result some were transported to the Isolation Centre run by AHS for testing and to await results. Those who did not need testing were offered transportation to one of the existing shelters and community spaces. We continue to work with Boyle Street Community Services to move people i nto bridge accommodation as soon as possible. City Administration i s working with supporting agencies to voluntarily move residents of Camp Pekiwewin to shelters. The City has provided ETS charter busing and Boyle Street Ventures moving crew to assist the transition. There have been between 10-20 relocations through this service (estimated). Other residents may have relocated on their own as activity at Camp Pekiwewin has been reducing daily this week. Camp Pekiwewin organizers have announced plans to host a r ally at the Alberta Legislature on Saturday as part of their plan to v oluntarily close the encampment.

Two additional applications have been approved for Business Association Stream funding i ncluding Eats on 118 from the Alberta Avenue BIA, and FQEmarket2020 from the French Quarter BIA. Both projects will need to demonstrate that they are able to match the grant funding to finalize eligibility. Last week the final BIA Annual General Meeting was completed. All budgets and board l ists have been submitted to the City and have been i ncluded i n the reports going forward on December 7 to City Council.

One new voluntary measure is also being implemented for the cities of Edmonton and Calgary. It is strongly recommended that individuals who live in these cities do not have any social gatherings inside their home, even if it is just a few people. If individuals do plan to meet, Alberta Health is strongly recommending that these gatherings occur outside of the home (e.g. backyard, front driveway, etc). Social gatherings in halls, facilities or other indoor locations are subject to the 15 person mandatory maximum. In addition, any municipality across the province that is under Watch (has an active case rate greater than 50 cases/100,000) will now be subject to the mandatory limit of 15 people or less for any private social gatherings. The following voluntary recommendations, currently in effect for Edmonton and Calgary, will also apply to any of these new areas: ● Wear non-medical masks in all indoor work settings, except when alone in workspaces such as offices or cubicles where you can be safely distanced from others or an appropriate barrier is in place. ● Limit number of cohorts to no more than three (including a core/household cohort, a school/work cohort, and one additional sport, social or other cohort). This information must remain confidential until Dr. Hinshaw's announcement this afternoon. Office of the City Manager Memorandum This change is a result of the continued rise in COVID-19 case numbers across the province. Please note that due to the dynamic nature of testing and reporting, the best source of current information is the Alberta Health website . My office continues to be in regular contact with AHS, including Dr. Chris Sikora, Medical Officer of Health for the Edmonton Zone and we will look at additional health measures if required.

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. Built in 1915, the Morrison Residence is significant for its association with early residential development in Highlands, one of Edmonton’s earliest suburbs. The residence is also significant for its modest Foursquare Style design. While the property retains strong architectural integrity, it is in generally poor condition. The property owner has been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the Morrison Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource. However, they have indicated they are not interested in retaining the residence. The property owner has satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality with the authority to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent. However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. c: Executive Leadership Team Kim Petrin, Branch Manager, Development Services Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

This includes the time required to receive notification of a fire, turn out of fire apparatus and travel time to the fire location. This does not include time to engage in fire suppression and rescue activities. The Building Code Interpretation Bulletin (STANDATA) indicates that it is the City’s responsibility as a municipality to periodically update our maps ""as changes in infrastructure and fire suppression capacity occur"". The safety of Edmontonians is a top priority for the City of Edmonton and the development industry. The response map has a direct correlation to the application of minimum building code standards. Where buildings are constructed beyond the ten minute response boundary additional fire safety measures are required. The current methodology for generating the 10 minute response map for application creates difficult processes which are poorly understood and challenging to execute, as well as resource-intensive. Our ability to adapt the map due to roadway changes in developing areas is strained. Previous map processes relied on driving trials conducted at specified times to best mimic emergency response which resulted in a manual, time consulting process that was subject to variation (traffic, weather, human error, etc). Establishing a new innovative process that could be easily replicated was based on statistical travel information, Edmonton Fire Rescue Services Standard Operating Procedures for emergency response and correlation with previous travel data. Consideration was provided for variables such as acceleration and deceleration, travel through intersections, as well as speed limits encountered on various portions of any route. The new process is now more automated, transparent, repeatable, consistent, and fair. The automation of the process reduces time to update the boundaries from weeks to days and can adapt to all new roads post commissioning. The criteria can also be used by the developer or builder for planning and development prior to building permit application.

Industry sessions to share information and answer any questions will be arranged as needed. Lastly, the 10 minute response map will be available online (as a layer on www.maps.edmonton.ca) for access and additional transparency.

In May 2020, Integrated Infrastructure Services (IIS) and Waste Services presented a business case to Council recommending that a public-private partnership (P3) delivery model be pursued. Based on approval of that recommendation, Waste Services and IIS proceeded with issuing an RFQ (Request for Qualification) for the Organics Processing Facilities (OPF) project, from which three Prequalified Bidders have been selected. Since the OPF would not be in operation until approximately 2025, Waste Services committed to secure interim organics processing capacity for both the single-unit and mulit-unit residences. Private-sector off-site processing was determined to be the best interim option, so an open solicitation was advertised to allow vendors to process a portion of the City’s organic waste for the next five or 10 years. The results from the solicitation were very favourable: it was found that there is sufficient interest from the private-sector to handle all of Edmonton’s organic waste in the interim and in the future at a cost that appears to be less than building a new OPF as originally planned. To ensure a full evaluation of this option (including cost, environmental, and social impacts), Administration is pausing all existing procurement activities on the OPF until Q2 2021. This alternative opportunity may be substantially more cost effective, which is fiscally responsible in light of the City’s current financial challenges and aligns with Council's goal of regional prosperity. Administration will complete this evaluation on or before March 31, 2021 and will advise Council of the results of the evaluation. Administration has notified the Prequalified Bidders of their selection and potential timeframe for issuing the Request For Proposal. Depending on the outcome of this analysis, the procurement would potentially be further postponed or cancelled, at which point the Prequalified Bidders would be notified.

Below is an update on adjustments to the campaign. Due to a recent increase in COVID-19 cases, and to minimize any person to person contact, in-person donation options on buses, LRT and cruisers are cancelled for this year’s campaign. Although the ways in which Edmontonians can donate will change, there is still a significant need to support Edmonton’s Food Bank this holiday season. Monetary donations will be accepted as per the original memo: ● donating $2, $5, $10 or more at the checkout counter at Save-On-Foods ● donating online via Edmonton’s Food Bank website and selecting ETS Stuff a Bus under “Fund” (minimum of $3 for online donations) ● texting FEEDYEG to 20222 to donate $10 or $20. A $2.62 contribution can provide one meal to one person, which can be covered by one online donation. If people still wish to donate non-perishable food items, ETS asks that they place their donations in the bins for Edmonton’s Food Bank at Save-On-Foods locations. High demand items for Edmonton’s Food Bank include pasta/pasta sauce, canned soups, canned fruits and vegetables, canned fish and meat, baby formula, school snacks, as well as small peanut butter jars.

Given the degree of community transmission currently occurring in Edmonton and the relatively low threshold for declaring an outbreak in a shelter setting, these events were not unexpected.

Operators have been closely following Alberta Health public health orders and are now taking additional precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures include increased sanitization, signage with distancing reminders and the use of personal protective equipment when responding to overdoses and other medical emergencies. Capacity at Edmonton Convention Centre remains at 300 as cots were already spaced at two metres to proactively meet the outbreak requirement. At Commonwealth Stadium, Hope Mission has reconfigured cots and daytime amenity space to allow two metres for physical distancing, reducing capacity from 120 to 110.

On November 16, 2020, City Council directed Administration to submit a detailed housing investment plan to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The list included five modular permanent supportive housing projects on four previously-approved, City-owned sites (and one newly acquired site) as well as potential hotel acquisitions led by Homeward Trust, supported by the City of Edmonton. Administration continues to explore the feasibility of several additional projects led by other non-market housing providers, where the City has no role in the development. Project submissions that prioritize housing for people experiencing homelessness and pass initial viability assessments will be included in the City’s investment plan. Decisions by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation on any additional project funding are expected by the end of 2020. Timeline for Modular Projects The City received $17.3 million in funding through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Rapid Housing Initiative Major Cities Stream and $6.2 million from the Government of Alberta’s Municipal Stimulus Program. This funding will allow the City to proceed with the construction of three modular supportive housing projects in: ● King Edward Park ● Wellington / McArthur Industrial ● A previously announced site in Ward 6 The timeline for building the three modular housing projects is being driven by the requirements of the Government of Alberta and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation that the funding is used by the end of 2021, and that occupancy is achieved within a year, respectively. The work on the King Edward Park and the Wellington/McArthur ../2 Office of the Deputy City Manager CITIZEN SERVICES Memorandum - 2 - Industrial sites is dependent on the rezoning application to allow the development of lowand medium-rise apartments, respectively. The public hearing to address the land use for these sites is scheduled for December 8, 2020. A report on the revised terms of sales for the King Edward Park and Wellington/McArthur sites will be brought forward in the first quarter of 2021, which will also include a new land sale agreement for the modular site in Ward 6. Communications and Engagement Considerations What We Heard reports for the first four supportive housing sites are complete and have been posted on edmonton.ca/supportivehousing . In addition to the reports, participants from Wellington and King Edward Park engagements were informed about the conversion from a traditional to modular build and that they can expect to see construction activities begin in spring 2021. Further construction and project updates will be shared following the rezoning public hearing. For the Ward 6 site, public engagement will begin in January 2021. It is important that the community first learn of the project directly from the City of Edmonton so that a smooth engagement process can follow. The engagement itself will focus on informing a good neighbour plan and certain design elements. Project Delivery and Construction The project delivery will be led by the City of Edmonton and Homeward Trust will participate in the project delivery team and provide input to the design process. At present, the construction management contract should be awarded by the end of 2020 and the selected construction manager will then select a modular builder and site servicing contractors and other services as required. As City-delivered projects, the projects will be reviewed by the Edmonton Design Committee, there will be a Percent for Art contribution and opportunity for on-site art commission, and the projects will follow the intent of the City’s sustainable building and accessibility policies. Administration anticipates that groundbreaking for the three projects could occur in spring 2021, with a total of 120-140 new units of supportive housing being built by the end of 2021 and occupancy in early 2022.

Stay home if you're feeling sick. ■ Toea,.,,ago ■ Toto•C.00<,t, The City, Government of Alberta Community and Social Services, Alberta Health Services and Homeward Trust are developing a new system-wide governance approach to shelter space management. This will i nclude contingencies for opening up new facilities and specialized i solation beds as needed. The City of Edmonton will be present on the steering committee and will provide overall support to the system. Edmonton Convention Centre (ECC) Edmonton Convention Centre i s operating at current capacity 168: 150 general spaces and 18 Tier 2 i solation spaces (close contacts). Alberta Health Services confirmed there are 60 active COVID-19 cases at the Convention Centre l inked to the current outbreak. This includes staff and clients. As a result of significant staff shortages, capacity has been reduced and operational changes are being considered, i ncluding bringing on additional contracted security personnel and staff pooling among the agencies. During the evening of December 1, a serious i ncident occurred as two clients were i nvolved i n an altercation outside the entrance to ECC. One client was transported to hospital. EPS responded to the site and ECC Security put the building in lockdown. EPS, ECC Security and the agencies i ntend to conduct a review of the situation to potentially i mplement new environmental and process measures at the site. Current security changes that are being i mplemented are as follows: ensuring all clients understand and agree to a code of conduct; regulations on drug use; better protocol and i nformation sharing on banning; and the addition of new contracted security officers. Commonwealth Stadium In response to reduced capacity at ECC, Hope Mission has made adjustments to allow for i ncreased capacity of cots to 138 (previously 110). Hope Mission i s running between 65-75% capacity nightly at their combined Downtown and Commonwealth l ocations. Staffing ratios on site are a concern with multiple Hope Mission and Commonwealth Stadium security staff i n i solation. Showers are now operational for clients on site. A portable trailer with showers i s on the concourse l evel. Mustard Seed (9935 75 Avenue) The Mustard Seed temporary shelter i s operating at full capacity (80 people). The Subdivision and Development Appeal Board (SDAB) hearing for the Mustard Seed temporary shelter permit was held on November 26, and the written decision from the SDAB will be published on December 11. Additional security expected at ECC C BC Community Impact Mitigation Strategy Integrated multi-department meetings are held twice a week to assess the actions i n the community plans to mitigate disruption. On December 1, Downtown Proud began providing dedicated l itter collection service i n the area i mmediately surrounding the ECC. Data analytics show additional calls for service related to social disorder i ncidents occurring between ECC and Commonwealth along East Jasper Avenue and 107 Avenue. EPS will be enhancing their presence along this route and the situation will continue to be monitored for potential new actions. CAMP PEKIWEWIN The site has been closed by an order of the City Manager for a period of one year, ending November 24, 2021. The site i s cleared of most debris with the exception of some metals. Reclamation of the site will occur i n the spring and turf will be repaired at that time. Cleaning of the the site i ncluded: ● 143 i ndividual camping sites ● 163,708 kgs of debris hauled (includes 6,500 kgs of metal from metal bins alone) ● 108 propane tanks ● 190 shopping carts ● 1,050 needles (more may remain i n or on the ground that were not recoverable at this time) ● 1 special needs bicycle and a few U of A hospital wheelchairs that were returned. LOCAL ECONOMY The O ne-on-one Support Program received 11 new i nquiries proposing a variety of i deas such as j ewelry i mporting and retailing, bubble tea, and a mobile COVID test kit. The total number of inquiries i n 2020 i s 772, which i s 30% more than the total number of inquiries i n 2019. On Thursday, the Local Economy Team hosted a webinar that provided guidance for new entrepreneurs on starting a business at a commercial l ocation. The Local Economy Team i s continuing to facilitate winter patios for 35 businesses. There are 13 businesses with patio proposals that require more enhanced support to address safety, accessibility and community concerns as we work through their winter patio concepts. The remaining businesses have signed a second declaration which allows them to set out minimal furniture and leaves 2 metres for pedestrians on the public sidewalk. The E dmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG) Program received 45 i ndividual business applications of which 28 applicants are eligible for a grant.

A report on the revised terms of sales for the King Edward Park and Wellington/McArthur sites will be brought forward in the first quarter of 2021, which will also include a new land sale agreement for the modular site in Ward 6. Communications and Engagement Considerations What We Heard reports for the first four supportive housing sites are complete and have been posted on edmonton.ca/supportivehousing . In addition to the reports, participants from Wellington and King Edward Park engagements were informed about the conversion from a traditional to modular build and that they can expect to see construction activities begin in spring 2021. Further construction and project updates will be shared following the rezoning public hearing. For the Ward 6 site, public engagement will begin in January 2021. It is important that the community first learn of the project directly from the City of Edmonton so that a smooth engagement process can follow. The engagement itself will focus on informing a good neighbour plan and certain design elements. Project Delivery and Construction The project delivery will be led by the City of Edmonton and Homeward Trust will participate in the project delivery team and provide input to the design process. At present, the construction management contract should be awarded by the end of 2020 and the selected construction manager will then select a modular builder and site servicing contractors and other services as required. As City-delivered projects, the projects will be reviewed by the Edmonton Design Committee, there will be a Percent for Art contribution and opportunity for on-site art commission, and the projects will follow the intent of the City’s sustainable building and accessibility policies. Administration anticipates that groundbreaking for the three projects could occur in spring 2021, with a total of 120-140 new units of supportive housing being built by the end of 2021 and occupancy in early 2022.

Stay home if you're feeling sick. ■ Toea,.,,ago ■ Toto•C.00<,t, The City, Government of Alberta Community and Social Services, Alberta Health Services and Homeward Trust are developing a new system-wide governance approach to shelter space management. This will i nclude contingencies for opening up new facilities and specialized i solation beds as needed. The City of Edmonton will be present on the steering committee and will provide overall support to the system. Edmonton Convention Centre (ECC) Edmonton Convention Centre i s operating at current capacity 168: 150 general spaces and 18 Tier 2 i solation spaces (close contacts). Alberta Health Services confirmed there are 60 active COVID-19 cases at the Convention Centre l inked to the current outbreak. This includes staff and clients. As a result of significant staff shortages, capacity has been reduced and operational changes are being considered, i ncluding bringing on additional contracted security personnel and staff pooling among the agencies. During the evening of December 1, a serious i ncident occurred as two clients were i nvolved i n an altercation outside the entrance to ECC. One client was transported to hospital. EPS responded to the site and ECC Security put the building in lockdown. EPS, ECC Security and the agencies i ntend to conduct a review of the situation to potentially i mplement new environmental and process measures at the site. Current security changes that are being i mplemented are as follows: ensuring all clients understand and agree to a code of conduct; regulations on drug use; better protocol and i nformation sharing on banning; and the addition of new contracted security officers. Commonwealth Stadium In response to reduced capacity at ECC, Hope Mission has made adjustments to allow for i ncreased capacity of cots to 138 (previously 110). Hope Mission i s running between 65-75% capacity nightly at their combined Downtown and Commonwealth l ocations. Staffing ratios on site are a concern with multiple Hope Mission and Commonwealth Stadium security staff i n i solation. Showers are now operational for clients on site. A portable trailer with showers i s on the concourse l evel. Mustard Seed (9935 75 Avenue) The Mustard Seed temporary shelter i s operating at full capacity (80 people). The Subdivision and Development Appeal Board (SDAB) hearing for the Mustard Seed temporary shelter permit was held on November 26, and the written decision from the SDAB will be published on December 11. Additional security expected at ECC C BC Community Impact Mitigation Strategy Integrated multi-department meetings are held twice a week to assess the actions i n the community plans to mitigate disruption. On December 1, Downtown Proud began providing dedicated l itter collection service i n the area i mmediately surrounding the ECC. Data analytics show additional calls for service related to social disorder i ncidents occurring between ECC and Commonwealth along East Jasper Avenue and 107 Avenue. EPS will be enhancing their presence along this route and the situation will continue to be monitored for potential new actions. CAMP PEKIWEWIN The site has been closed by an order of the City Manager for a period of one year, ending November 24, 2021. The site i s cleared of most debris with the exception of some metals. Reclamation of the site will occur i n the spring and turf will be repaired at that time. Cleaning of the the site i ncluded: ● 143 i ndividual camping sites ● 163,708 kgs of debris hauled (includes 6,500 kgs of metal from metal bins alone) ● 108 propane tanks ● 190 shopping carts ● 1,050 needles (more may remain i n or on the ground that were not recoverable at this time) ● 1 special needs bicycle and a few U of A hospital wheelchairs that were returned. LOCAL ECONOMY The O ne-on-one Support Program received 11 new i nquiries proposing a variety of i deas such as j ewelry i mporting and retailing, bubble tea, and a mobile COVID test kit. The total number of inquiries i n 2020 i s 772, which i s 30% more than the total number of inquiries i n 2019. On Thursday, the Local Economy Team hosted a webinar that provided guidance for new entrepreneurs on starting a business at a commercial l ocation. The Local Economy Team i s continuing to facilitate winter patios for 35 businesses. There are 13 businesses with patio proposals that require more enhanced support to address safety, accessibility and community concerns as we work through their winter patio concepts. The remaining businesses have signed a second declaration which allows them to set out minimal furniture and leaves 2 metres for pedestrians on the public sidewalk. The E dmonton Economic Recovery Grant (EERG) Program received 45 i ndividual business applications of which 28 applicants are eligible for a grant.

If designated, any future renovation of the Strathcona Garage will be required to meet the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the Heritage Resources Reserve will pay the owner up to $500,000 for rehabilitation. The current Reserve balance is sufficient to cover committed funding, including the Strathcona Garage. The total estimated cost of the restoration work for the project is estimated at greater than $1 million. Beyond the $500,000 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, the property owner is responsible for all costs of the restoration work for the project. The projections for the Reserve (using current commitments) anticipate a Reserve balance of $3,157,011.14 at the end of 2020. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. Based on the current commitments, the Reserve balance is anticipated to decline to a balance of $699,188.17 at the end of 2021. The Reserve is funded by the tax levy on an annual basis ($2.3 million in 2020 including $418,000 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd).

The building is listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. Built in 1960, the Westwood Transit Garage is significant as an example of the Structural Expressionism of the Modern movement. Structural Expressionist buildings incorporate the ideals of interchangeable prefabricated parts, flexibility in design and economy of construction. The main concept behind the design is using the structural components to dictate the aesthetic of the building. The Westwood Transit Garage was constructed in proximity to the former Edmonton Municipal Airport, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and the Edmonton Power building. The functional nature of the building as a transit garage, coupled with its broader setting, rationalized its industrial aesthetic. The building features a prominent canopy of elegant, pre-cast concrete panels on the east facade. The building consists of a series of steel tube columns that support large, horizontal concrete trusses spanned by thin pre-cast concrete vaults. This use of concrete trusses was very unusual as concrete is strong in resisting compressive force, yet weak at resisting the tensile forces that prevail in a truss. It is a good example of how architects and engineers were experimenting with materials at the time, and how the expression of those materials determined the final form of the building. The Westwood Transit Garage was designed by the City Architect’s office of the day, led by Robert Falconer Duke, with assistance from Walter Telfer. Duke is credited with the design of several significant City buildings, including the Borden Park Swimming Pool and Bandshell and the Glenora Substation. He was also involved, to varying degrees as City Architect, in the design and development of other significant buildings, such as Fire Station Number 4, the Rossdale Water Filtration Plant, Fire Station Number 1 and the Queen Elizabeth II Planetarium. 1 City Planning URBAN FORM AND CORPORATE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT Memorandum December 11 , 2020 Reference No.: 379019390-001 To: City Council From: Rhonda Toohey, Acting Branch Manager Subject: Westwood Transit Garage, 11840 - 106A Street NW, Application to Demolish The property was sold in February 2019 by the City of Edmonton to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) to facilitate the future expansion of the NAIT campus.

Known as the Municipal Measurement Index (MMI), the tool is one of the commitments in the United Conservative Party (UCP) election platform. The UCP had committed to “improve local government financial reporting by preparing an annual Alberta Municipalities Measurement Index so Albertans can evaluate the performance of their local government in comparison with others on such key fiscal indicators as the property tax burden, revenues, spending, and debt.” Earlier this week City Administration, along with representatives from the City of Calgary and other municipal associations, attended a confidential preview of the new MMI. At this point in time, the Province has not officially or publicly released the new MMI nor confirmed when that announcement would be made (initial suggestions are that it may not be released until January 2021, but it could happen sooner given municipal stakeholders have been given the opportunity to preview). City Administration is of the opinion that what was shared about the MMI does not create specific cause for concern for our municipality. The City is supportive of accountability and transparency; as a municipality, we are the most transparent order of government and are accountable to local taxpayers and also to the province through various statutory reporting requirements. Not only do we adhere to all provincial regulations for reporting this information, we have gone beyond Office of the Deputy City Manager COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Memorandum 2 these requirements to incorporate accurate and transparent best practices in our reporting and budgeting processes. Municipal Affairs indicated that they are pulling their municipal data from currently available sources (Financial Information Return, Statistical Returns, Statistics Canada). The MMI dashboard will include the following key metrics: ● Residential Tax Rate ● Non Residential Tax Rate ● Municipal Tax Levy ● Composition of Assessment ● Municipal Debt per Capita ● Long-Term Debt - Debt Limit Ratio ● Revenue and Expenses per Capita ● Accumulated Surplus Per Capita The new MMI will be an online tool that allows the public to view select financial and statistical data across all Alberta municipalities. The tool allows users to compare data across selected municipalities, and provides graphs of selected financial indicators at the individual municipality level over different periods of time (going back to 2009). It will enable the user to identify those municipalities that are better comparisons to each other through an index that categorizes municipalities based on the population, equalized assessment and geographic area. At this point in time, Municipal Affairs indicated no immediate plans to compare municipalities across different provinces or compare different municipal servicing levels. Municipal Affairs further indicated that the MMI is a work in progress, and will continue to evolve and be refined as may be required. The Province has been using a type of municipal report card since 2017 called the Annual Municipal Indicator Report which includes 13 performance indicators, and has indicated plans to continue using it. Those indicators are used to calculate the percentage of municipalities that are deemed to be “not at risk” based on defined financial, governance, and community indicators. In the last three years, Edmonton received letters from Municipal Affairs indicating the City has not triggered any of the 13 indicators, thus being deemed not at risk. 3 Once the MMI is released, City Administration will undertake a comprehensive analysis of the new tool.

Municipal Affairs further indicated that the MMI is a work in progress, and will continue to evolve and be refined as may be required. The Province has been using a type of municipal report card since 2017 called the Annual Municipal Indicator Report which includes 13 performance indicators, and has indicated plans to continue using it. Those indicators are used to calculate the percentage of municipalities that are deemed to be “not at risk” based on defined financial, governance, and community indicators. In the last three years, Edmonton received letters from Municipal Affairs indicating the City has not triggered any of the 13 indicators, thus being deemed not at risk. 3 Once the MMI is released, City Administration will undertake a comprehensive analysis of the new tool. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you. CO/jh c: Executive Leadership Team Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk",,"No",,,

The purpose of today’s meeting was to introduce the group, and discussion focused primarily on options to reach communities with the care packages containing masks, hand sanitizer, and multi-language COVID information, such as including packages in hampers distributed by the Food Bank. In early December, the Province of Alberta contracted Red Cross volunteers to assemble information cards , hand sanitizer and masks and to date 12,240 kits have been assembled. The City of Edmonton COVID Task Team worked with the Red Cross and the Edmonton EXPO Centre to have the supplies housed and the kits assembled. During the meeting today, the Community Outreach Table discussed options to have these supplies distributed to those in need. As a start, the Food Bank will begin to distribute them as part of their existing food hampers starting this week in hot zones. The Red Cross continues to use volunteers to assemble the kits, the size of each kit will be informed by the distribution channel (food banks for example).

Construction Certification-Exempt projects (i.e. those smaller than the 500m 2 or unoccupied) are demonstrating, within project report deliverables, how the project will be designed and constructed to meet the intent of this Policy. Note that LRT stations are defined as “unoccupied” buildings and as a result the LRT stations are considered exempt from this policy. Sustainability in existing City-Owned buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.2 ) The BOMA BEST Certification rollout plan was completed in early 2019 with an interim objective set of completing 30 buildings by 2023 . At year end 2019 five buildings were finalizing certification and were completed in early 2020. Five (5) Energy Audits have been completed between May 2018 and December 2019. These 5 audits are included in the 55 audits that have been completed for the 2019-2022 rehabilitation projects. Ten (10) additional audits have been started during this timeframe but have not yet been completed. The information gathered from the Energy Audits informs the rehabilitation project scope development and design. Facility rehabilitation projects for which an energy audit has not been completed are informed by draft reports, as well as involvement of the energy audit consu","the energy audit consultants in the planning and design phase. One hundred and fourteen (114) City-owned large buildings on 109 properties participated in the City of Edmonton Benchmarking program in 2019. Those remaining City buildings without complete, verifiable energy use data were not included in the program, but will be once their energy use data can be collected and verified. This number is up from 24 City-owned large buildings from the pilot year in 2017 and a total of 50 buildings participating by the end of 2018. City Acquisition of Existing Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.3 ) The majority of acquisitions have been for land. Any existing structures on these properties will be demolished as part of the intended projects or surplused from City inventory once the project is complete. City Owned buildings Leased to Others ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.4 ) The current state for leasing has a number of agreements that reference Policy C532. However, leasing has received feedback from tenants that adhering to City Policies as part of lease requirements could prove difficult due to the operation-ownership models specific to those leases. An assessment of how the lease must be changed to incorporate C532 requirements is under way and will be addressed in the next revision of the policy. 3 City-Leased Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.5 ) Administration has initiated, for the leasing process, a program to screen potential buildings and facilities based on the requirements of Policy C532. This process includes understanding the status of the buildings and facilities energy use, emissions, and ability to achieve or maintain BOMA BEST. The BOMA BEST program development will be a focus point in 2020. It also includes negotiating lease and site improvement work. There have been no new lease agreements entered into over the timeframe of this report that trigger section 1.5.3. BOMA BEST Certification, that is: “1,000m 2 in situations where the term is greater than 5 years and that leased space is greater than 50% of the total building area.” Process for application of this policy to lease renewal is currently under revision. City-funded non-City owned Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.6 ) New eligible non-City owned buildings that are more than 33% funded by the City are meeting the same policy standards that are required of new City-owned buildings that are eligible by C532 policy. These are reported in section 1.1.3b) “new construction projects”. Exceptions to this Policy ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.7 ) ‘Exceptions’ are facilities that would normally be in the scope of C532 policy, but for some extraordinary reasons may be allowed. This would require facilities to submit supporting documentation to the Sustainable Building Team and upon support from this group gain approval from the Deputy City Manager of Integrated Infrastructure Services to formally authorize an Exception to the policy. No exceptions were requested nor authorized for the period of May 2, 2018 to December 31, 2019.

EDMONTON COMMUNITY OUTREACH TABLES As part of Edmonton’s community outreach, the City hosted the inaugural Edmonton Community Outreach Table. This multidisciplinary group i ncludes representatives from the Multicultural Health Brokers Cooperative, Medical Doctors International, Mennonite Center for Newcomers, Edmonton Food Bank, Red Cross, University of Alberta, Government of Alberta, Alberta Health Services and the City of Edmonton. The group was convened to i nform what additional on-the-ground supports and interventions could help l imit the spread of the virus i n these high-risk areas. The Province of Alberta has contracted Red Cross volunteers to assemble care kits with i nformation cards, hand sanitizer and masks. The City of Edmonton COVID Task Team worked with the Red Cross and Edmonton EXPO Centre to have the supplies housed and 12,240 kits have been assembled. The Community Outreach Table i s discussing options to have these supplies distributed to those i n need. The Food Bank will begin i nitial distribution as part of their food hampers program. The Edmonton Community Outreach Table will reconvene next week to discuss further actions.

This memorandum provides information relating to the application of the Sustainable Building Policy to City Facility projects that have completed the concept phase and for which design has been initiated, for the period of May 2, 2018 - December 31, 2019. Policy Progress: For design and construction of new City-owned and Occupied buildings, or new additions with gross floor area of 500m 2 or greater for City-Owned and occupied Buildings the targets are as follows: 1 Office of the Deputy City Manager URBAN FORM AND CORPORATE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE SERVICES Memorandum December 17, 2020 Reference No.: 361253079-001 To: City Council From: Stephanie McCabe, Deputy City Manager Urban Form and Corporate Strategic Development Jason Meliefste, Acting Deputy City Manager Integrated Infrastructure Services Mary Persson, Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer Financial and Corporate Services Subject: Policy C532 - Sustainable Building Policy - Annual Report 2019 Table 1 - Design and Construction of City-Owned Buildings Sustainability Targets (Section 1.1.3) A LEED Silver certification requirements B Achieve 40% or greater energy efficiency than the National Energy Code of For projects in the design phase noted Under Review ( UR in Table 2 ) the project team is reviewing the design to meet the targets, as they are currently not meeting targets.

LRT (non-stations) -Gerry Wright OMF Facility B -Heritage Valley OMF -Lewis Farm LRV Storage Facility -Llew Lawrence LRV Storage Facility (LLSF) ✔ UR UR UR ✔ Since the targets approved in May 2017 many active projects currently in construction were previously developed with existing scope and approved budget and do not meet the full requirements of the current Sustainable Building Policy (C532). Construction Certification-Exempt projects (i.e. those smaller than the 500m 2 or unoccupied) are demonstrating, within project report deliverables, how the project will be designed and constructed to meet the intent of this Policy. Note that LRT stations are defined as “unoccupied” buildings and as a result the LRT stations are considered exempt from this policy. Sustainability in existing City-Owned buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.2 ) The BOMA BEST Certification rollout plan was completed in early 2019 with an interim objective set of completing 30 buildings by 2023 . At year end 2019 five buildings were finalizing certification and were completed in early 2020. Five (5) Energy Audits have been completed between May 2018 and December 2019. These 5 audits are included in the 55 audits that have been completed for the 2019-2022 rehabilitation projects. Ten (10) additional audits have been started during this timeframe but have not yet been completed. The information gathered from the Energy Audits informs the rehabilitation project scope development and design. Facility rehabilitation projects for which an energy audit has not been completed are informed by draft reports, as well as involvement of the energy audit consu","the energy audit consultants in the planning and design phase. One hundred and fourteen (114) City-owned large buildings on 109 properties participated in the City of Edmonton Benchmarking program in 2019. Those remaining City buildings without complete, verifiable energy use data were not included in the program, but will be once their energy use data can be collected and verified. This number is up from 24 City-owned large buildings from the pilot year in 2017 and a total of 50 buildings participating by the end of 2018. City Acquisition of Existing Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.3 ) The majority of acquisitions have been for land. Any existing structures on these properties will be demolished as part of the intended projects or surplused from City inventory once the project is complete. City Owned buildings Leased to Others ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.4 ) The current state for leasing has a number of agreements that reference Policy C532. However, leasing has received feedback from tenants that adhering to City Policies as part of lease requirements could prove difficult due to the operation-ownership models specific to those leases. An assessment of how the lease must be changed to incorporate C532 requirements is under way and will be addressed in the next revision of the policy. 3 City-Leased Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.5 ) Administration has initiated, for the leasing process, a program to screen potential buildings and facilities based on the requirements of Policy C532. This process includes understanding the status of the buildings and facilities energy use, emissions, and ability to achieve or maintain BOMA BEST. The BOMA BEST program development will be a focus point in 2020. It also includes negotiating lease and site improvement work. There have been no new lease agreements entered into over the timeframe of this report that trigger section 1.5.3. BOMA BEST Certification, that is: “1,000m 2 in situations where the term is greater than 5 years and that leased space is greater than 50% of the total building area.” Process for application of this policy to lease renewal is currently under revision. City-funded non-City owned Buildings ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.6 ) New eligible non-City owned buildings that are more than 33% funded by the City are meeting the same policy standards that are required of new City-owned buildings that are eligible by C532 policy. These are reported in section 1.1.3b) “new construction projects”. Exceptions to this Policy ( refers to Policy C532, Section 1.7 ) ‘Exceptions’ are facilities that would normally be in the scope of C532 policy, but for some extraordinary reasons may be allowed. This would require facilities to submit supporting documentation to the Sustainable Building Team and upon support from this group gain approval from the Deputy City Manager of Integrated Infrastructure Services to formally authorize an Exception to the policy. No exceptions were requested nor authorized for the period of May 2, 2018 to December 31, 2019.

EDMONTON COMMUNITY OUTREACH TABLES As part of Edmonton’s community outreach, the City hosted the inaugural Edmonton Community Outreach Table. This multidisciplinary group i ncludes representatives from the Multicultural Health Brokers Cooperative, Medical Doctors International, Mennonite Center for Newcomers, Edmonton Food Bank, Red Cross, University of Alberta, Government of Alberta, Alberta Health Services and the City of Edmonton. The group was convened to i nform what additional on-the-ground supports and interventions could help l imit the spread of the virus i n these high-risk areas. The Province of Alberta has contracted Red Cross volunteers to assemble care kits with i nformation cards, hand sanitizer and masks. The City of Edmonton COVID Task Team worked with the Red Cross and Edmonton EXPO Centre to have the supplies housed and 12,240 kits have been assembled. The Community Outreach Table i s discussing options to have these supplies distributed to those i n need. The Food Bank will begin i nitial distribution as part of their food hampers program. The Edmonton Community Outreach Table will reconvene next week to discuss further actions.

This memo summarizes the first year of joining the ISO 37120 Standard for Sustainable Development of Communities which provides the City of Edmonton with a municipal benchmarking standard for city services and quality of life. Benchmarking Benchmarking is the practice of comparing, evaluating or checking something against a standard or comparative. It can provide insight to calibrate results and identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. In the context of the City’s EPM program, benchmarking enable us to calibrate performance and provide insight into how well the City of Edmonton is achieving the three primary objectives of our Corporate Business Plan: 1) Making Transformational Change 2) Delivering Excellent Services, and 3) Managing our Corporation. The World Council on City Data and ISO 37120 In July 2019, the Government of Canada announced the Data for Canadian Cities Pilot Project with the World Council on City Data (WCCD. The project is intended to broaden WCCD’s benchmarking initiative across Canada, build data capacity for Canadian municipalities, and to better plan and implement the Federal investments in public infrastructure. WCCD will work with 15 municipalities ( Attachment 2 ) across Canada to help them become certified under ISO 37120, the first international standard for city data. It is a three year commitment from member municipalities, and the Government of Canada will cover the program costs for two of the three years and provide additional support to the WCCD to achieve certification with the 15 cities.

The full list of indicators are enclosed as Attachment 1. In 2019, the City of Edmonton signed an agreement with the World Council for City Data (WCCD) to participate in the Data for Canadian Cities Pilot Project. In Q1 of 2020 the City of Edmonton achieved Platinum certification in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 37120 certification. This is the highest level a certification a municipality can obtain by reporting at least 91 of the 104 indicators. Current Application of Benchmarking in EPM The ISO 37120 indicators fit into the City’s Enterprise Performance Management system as “calibration” measures ( Attachment 3 ). Edmonton is able to compare results using standard measurement with peer cities on the basis of various criteria such as population size, density, economic profile, demographic makeup and location. Through regular performance monitoring within the City’s EPM framework, the corporation will be able to evaluate how well we are building a sustainable community as we work to achieve the goals of ConnectEdmonton, The City Plan and the Corporate Business Plan collectively. Benchmarking and Continuous Improvement In November of 2020 Administration accepted the Office of the City Auditor’s recommendation to incorporate benchmarking into productivity measures for key services as part of the EPM framework. This work will focus on identifying relevant productivity benchmark measures, integrating these measures into the EPM framework and supporting business areas to utilize productivity benchmark measures in their performance discussions to identify opportunities and improve service delivery. Next Steps The EPM program is intended to actively seek continuous improvement. As such, administration is also evaluating other supplemental benchmarking initiatives while working towards ISO37120 certification. WCCD offers two other certifications that have indicators relating to a ‘Safe City’ and a ‘Resilient City’. In 2021, these additional certifications will be evaluated as potential additional benchmarking sources. The MBNCanada program is currently also under evaluation as a potential to include for benchmarking for service delivery and managing the corporation. The City of Edmonton is committed to t","ransparently reporting on our performance to City Council and Edmontonians. As part of Administration’s response to the Productivity and Performance Audit, a corporate performance report that highlights benchmarked productivity measures will be prepared and brought forward to City Council and will subsequently be made available online to Edmontonains.

PROVINCIAL DATA REPORTING Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, yesterday said at her m edia availability that provincial updates on COVID-19 cases and outbreaks during the holiday will not happen i n the usual manner. From December 24 -27 there will be no l ive updates or website updates. Abbreviated i nformation will be shared via D r. Hinshaw’s twitter account. The next l ive update will be on December 28. From December 31 to January 3, updates will once again be provided via twitter. PROVINCIAL COMMUNITY OUTREACH Yesterday, volunteers began door-to-door delivery of community care packages i n Mill Woods and Castle Downs. They delivered 1,020 kits yesterday and will continue to deliver packages door-to-door today. The Red Cross continues to prepare the packages that i nclude masks, hand sanitizer and multilingual i nformation to support the Community Outreach Initiative. Approximately 25,000 kits have been packaged and more than 4,000 of these have been supplied to Edmonton’s Food Bank to distribute with food hampers. The Red Cross has also taken the l ead on facilitating requests from other community groups and organizations for COVID-19 Care Packages. FACE COVERINGS AND MASKS ON TRANSIT Transit Peace Officers, i n accordance with Provincial Health Orders, will begin to escort people from Transit property (trains, buses, platforms, etc.) i f they are actively refusing to wear a face covering/mask (except those who claim an exemption from the Order). Officers will begin by educating i ndividuals, providing a mask and seeking compliance first and only using removal from transit for those i ndividuals demonstrating active resistance. Where an individual claims an exemption, the officer will work with the individual to ensure appropriate physical distancing from others i s observed. WORLD JUNIORS HOCKEY The Vice Chairs of the Task Team met with AHS and the World Junior organizers over the weekend. Although there are COVID-19 cases reported, Dr. Sikora i ndicated that the testing, screening and bubble are working as i ntended. EDMONTON COMMUNITY OUTREACH TABLES The Edmonton Community Outreach Table convened yesterday and reviewed the draft Terms of Reference for the group. The group will reconvene again i n early January to discuss assessment criteria for grant funding app","ria for grant funding applications. COVID-19 cases by month for Canada COVID-19 cases by month for Alberta Shelter capacity data from Homeward trust Dr. Hinshaw shares holiday message with Albertans Journal The Community Outreach Table i ncludes representatives from Alberta Health Services, Alberta Native Friendship Centre Association, City of Edmonton, Edmonton Food Bank, Government of Alberta, Medical Doctors International, Mennonite Center for Newcomers, Multicultural Health Brokers Cooperative, REACH Edmonton, Red Cross, and University of Alberta. NATIONAL COVID-19 STATUS On Wednesday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, i ssued a statement on COVID-19 stating that there are 75,523 active cases across the country with an average of 6,614 new cases (December 16-22). Provincial and territorial data i ndicate that an average of 3,372 people were being treated i n Canadian hospitals each day during the most recent 7-day period (December 16-22), including 681 i n i ntensive care units. During the same period, there were an average of 109 COVID-19-related deaths reported daily. SHELTERS Shelter capacity during the week ranged from 50-150 beds available per night. Alberta Health Services maintains a l ist of i ndividuals who do not have a fixed address that have contracted COVID-19 and their close contacts. As of December 22, there are 66 cases and 94 close contacts on the l ist. This marks the fifth consecutive day of a reduction of cases i n the population. Agency partners are continuing to pivot their activities to meet evolving needs. Action taken over the weekend and early this week included an i ncrease of regular beds at ECC, changes to bed types at Commonwealth and Mustard Seed (shift of Tier 2 i solation beds back to general shelter use), better i ntegration across agencies on space availability, and new capacity being brought online. As of today, Homeward Trust i s l easing out a west end hotel for Tier 2 i solation beds with the potential to offer bridge housing. Jasper Place Health and Wellness Centre will be the operator on site. The number of beds and their usage type - Tier 2 or bridge - will be fluid. The i nitial ramp up of available beds will begin at 20. Tipinawâ w (at Edmonton Convention Centre) (ECC) The temporary shelter at Edmonton Convention Centre has been renamed Tipinawâ w (Tee-pin-a-waw) which means ‘ sheltered from the outside elements’ i n Cree. This name was given to the facility by Elder Rose Wabasca during a naming ceremony organized by Bent Arrow Traditional Healing Society at the convention centre. Regular beds are full overnight (250) with l imited Tier 2 i solation usage. There has not been a case of community transmission at the ECC since November 25; however, l imited cases among staff members have occurred during this time. It has not been determined whether these cases were acquired at ECC. For an outbreak to be lifted there must be a 28-day period of no new cases at the l ocation. Due to the i ndeterminate nature of staff member cases i t i s unknown ᑎᐱᓇᐋᐧᐤ tipinawâw whether the outbreak status will be l ifted next week when the ECC agencies make the request to AHS. EPS, on request of the agencies working at Tipinawâ w , toured the facility to gain a better understanding of operations and offer i nputs. This was a productive meeting and further strengthened the relationship between EPS, facility and the social agency sector. Takeaway from the meeting i s that EPS will be developing training materials for Explore Edmonton and agency staff to i dentify and manage the disposal of i llegal substances found on site. Based on how these training materials are received, EPS may also offer training to other social agencies i n Edmonton. On December 18, AHS Environmental Public Health Inspectors visited ECC and provided commentary that ECC “is their star shelter now” and asked for that i nformation to be passed along to agency staff and the City. Following up on a request from ECC, NET partnered with Community Social Workers, Recover, ECC security, Boyle Street Ventures and Explore Edmonton to develop a solution to troublesome l ocations on the exterior of the building. A planned animation has been put i n place this week as donated Christmas trees will act as a fence barrier to stop l oitering and social disorder under an external vent near emergency exit doors. The trees have l ights and hand crafted decorations put on by community members who are using the ECC. Other animation will i nclude 4 solar l ights being placed i n dark area spots and drawings made by the YMCA daycare kids that will be placed on all the boarded windows. Tipinawâ w i s celebrating the holiday season. Multiple trees have been donated to the agencies and have been set up i n the shelter helping create a festive mood. On Christmas day there will be a tourtiere l unch as well as a traditional turkey meal i n the evening. The Citadel’s A Christmas Carol will be streamed. Volunteers will be handing out gifts (essential i tems such as socks and mittens) to people spending Christmas at the shelter. The Christmas activities, including the meals, are due i n part to generous corporate and individual donations. Commonwealth Stadium The Commonwealth shelter i s operating at 70-90% capacity overnight and 40-50% capacity during the day (120 people maximum). Mustard Seed (99 Street) The Mustard Seed temporary shelter i s operating at full capacity overnight (80 people). Community Impact Mitigation Strategy Last week the Government of Alberta moved i ts social assistance cheque day from December 29-30, to December 23-24. This short notice change presented a challenge on i mplementing past physical distancing tactics at key financial i nstitutions servicing the vulnerable population. City Operations and EPS were nimble i n adjusting to this change through a strong working relationship with Boyle Street Community Services. At the ATB l ocation on 105 Avenue, Boyle Street Community Services will set-up and take down l ine-up fencing on the site. City Operations will set up and take down fencing and i nitiate a lane closure at the CIBC on Jasper Avenue. In the new year, COE, EPS and Boyle Street Community Services will convene to plan for subsequent cheque days so processes are as efficient as possible while still offering physical distancing to participants and l imiting disruptions to neighbours. LOCAL ECONOMY There i s no Local Economy update this week. Updates will resume i n January.

Where an individual claims an exemption, the officer will work with the individual to ensure appropriate physical distancing from others i s observed. WORLD JUNIORS HOCKEY The Vice Chairs of the Task Team met with AHS and the World Junior organizers over the weekend. Although there are COVID-19 cases reported, Dr. Sikora i ndicated that the testing, screening and bubble are working as i ntended. EDMONTON COMMUNITY OUTREACH TABLES The Edmonton Community Outreach Table convened yesterday and reviewed the draft Terms of Reference for the group. The group will reconvene again i n early January to discuss assessment criteria for grant funding app","ria for grant funding applications. COVID-19 cases by month for Canada COVID-19 cases by month for Alberta Shelter capacity data from Homeward trust Dr. Hinshaw shares holiday message with Albertans Journal The Community Outreach Table i ncludes representatives from Alberta Health Services, Alberta Native Friendship Centre Association, City of Edmonton, Edmonton Food Bank, Government of Alberta, Medical Doctors International, Mennonite Center for Newcomers, Multicultural Health Brokers Cooperative, REACH Edmonton, Red Cross, and University of Alberta. NATIONAL COVID-19 STATUS On Wednesday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, i ssued a statement on COVID-19 stating that there are 75,523 active cases across the country with an average of 6,614 new cases (December 16-22). Provincial and territorial data i ndicate that an average of 3,372 people were being treated i n Canadian hospitals each day during the most recent 7-day period (December 16-22), including 681 i n i ntensive care units. During the same period, there were an average of 109 COVID-19-related deaths reported daily. SHELTERS Shelter capacity during the week ranged from 50-150 beds available per night. Alberta Health Services maintains a l ist of i ndividuals who do not have a fixed address that have contracted COVID-19 and their close contacts. As of December 22, there are 66 cases and 94 close contacts on the l ist. This marks the fifth consecutive day of a reduction of cases i n the population. Agency partners are continuing to pivot their activities to meet evolving needs. Action taken over the weekend and early this week included an i ncrease of regular beds at ECC, changes to bed types at Commonwealth and Mustard Seed (shift of Tier 2 i solation beds back to general shelter use), better i ntegration across agencies on space availability, and new capacity being brought online. As of today, Homeward Trust i s l easing out a west end hotel for Tier 2 i solation beds with the potential to offer bridge housing. Jasper Place Health and Wellness Centre will be the operator on site. The number of beds and their usage type - Tier 2 or bridge - will be fluid. The i nitial ramp up of available beds will begin at 20. Tipinawâ w (at Edmonton Convention Centre) (ECC) The temporary shelter at Edmonton Convention Centre has been renamed Tipinawâ w (Tee-pin-a-waw) which means ‘ sheltered from the outside elements’ i n Cree. This name was given to the facility by Elder Rose Wabasca during a naming ceremony organized by Bent Arrow Traditional Healing Society at the convention centre. Regular beds are full overnight (250) with l imited Tier 2 i solation usage. There has not been a case of community transmission at the ECC since November 25; however, l imited cases among staff members have occurred during this time. It has not been determined whether these cases were acquired at ECC. For an outbreak to be lifted there must be a 28-day period of no new cases at the l ocation. Due to the i ndeterminate nature of staff member cases i t i s unknown ᑎᐱᓇᐋᐧᐤ tipinawâw whether the outbreak status will be l ifted next week when the ECC agencies make the request to AHS. EPS, on request of the agencies working at Tipinawâ w , toured the facility to gain a better understanding of operations and offer i nputs. This was a productive meeting and further strengthened the relationship between EPS, facility and the social agency sector. Takeaway from the meeting i s that EPS will be developing training materials for Explore Edmonton and agency staff to i dentify and manage the disposal of i llegal substances found on site. Based on how these training materials are received, EPS may also offer training to other social agencies i n Edmonton. On December 18, AHS Environmental Public Health Inspectors visited ECC and provided commentary that ECC “is their star shelter now” and asked for that i nformation to be passed along to agency staff and the City. Following up on a request from ECC, NET partnered with Community Social Workers, Recover, ECC security, Boyle Street Ventures and Explore Edmonton to develop a solution to troublesome l ocations on the exterior of the building. A planned animation has been put i n place this week as donated Christmas trees will act as a fence barrier to stop l oitering and social disorder under an external vent near emergency exit doors. The trees have l ights and hand crafted decorations put on by community members who are using the ECC. Other animation will i nclude 4 solar l ights being placed i n dark area spots and drawings made by the YMCA daycare kids that will be placed on all the boarded windows. Tipinawâ w i s celebrating the holiday season. Multiple trees have been donated to the agencies and have been set up i n the shelter helping create a festive mood. On Christmas day there will be a tourtiere l unch as well as a traditional turkey meal i n the evening. The Citadel’s A Christmas Carol will be streamed. Volunteers will be handing out gifts (essential i tems such as socks and mittens) to people spending Christmas at the shelter. The Christmas activities, including the meals, are due i n part to generous corporate and individual donations. Commonwealth Stadium The Commonwealth shelter i s operating at 70-90% capacity overnight and 40-50% capacity during the day (120 people maximum). Mustard Seed (99 Street) The Mustard Seed temporary shelter i s operating at full capacity overnight (80 people). Community Impact Mitigation Strategy Last week the Government of Alberta moved i ts social assistance cheque day from December 29-30, to December 23-24. This short notice change presented a challenge on i mplementing past physical distancing tactics at key financial i nstitutions servicing the vulnerable population. City Operations and EPS were nimble i n adjusting to this change through a strong working relationship with Boyle Street Community Services. At the ATB l ocation on 105 Avenue, Boyle Street Community Services will set-up and take down l ine-up fencing on the site. City Operations will set up and take down fencing and i nitiate a lane closure at the CIBC on Jasper Avenue. In the new year, COE, EPS and Boyle Street Community Services will convene to plan for subsequent cheque days so processes are as efficient as possible while still offering physical distancing to participants and l imiting disruptions to neighbours.

CURRENT ACTIONS (Immediate) 1. That a Notice of Intention to Designate a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1, be served on the owners of the property located at 9851 - 83 Avenue NW in accordance with Section 26 of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9.1 2. That the City Manager be appointed to implement matters arising from the issuance of the Notice of Intention to Designate the Bugis Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource, as set out in Attachment 1. FUTURE ACTIONS (At least 60 days after the Notice of Intention to Designate is served) 1. Pursuant to the provisions of the Alberta Historical Resources Act , RSA 2000, c H-9, a Bylaw to Designate the Bugis Residence as Municipal Historic Resource (the “Bylaw”) will be brought forward to Council for their consideration. 1 On November 26, 2019, City Council passed amendments to the City Administration Bylaw, delegating approval of Notices of Intention to Designate (NOI) under the Historical Resources Act (HRA) to the City Manager, where the owner consents to the designation of their property. The NOI initiates the designation process under the Historical Resources Act ; the final decision on designation remains with City Council by way of a bylaw. 1 City Planning URBAN FORM AND CORPORATE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT Memorandum December 29, 2020 Reference No.: 659671-003 To: City Council From: Rhonda Toohey, Acting Branch Manager Subject: Notice of Intention to Designate the Bugis Residence as a Municipal Historic Resource 2. If approved, the Bylaw and corresponding Rehabilitation Incentive and Maintenance Agreement will contemplate funding of up to $75,000 to be provided from the Heritage Resources Reserve to fund City-funded work on the Bugis Residence, as described in Attachment 5. BACKGROUND The Bugis Residence is on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton, and merits designation under City Policy C450B - Policy to Encourage the Designation and Rehabilitation of Municipal Historic Resources in Edmonton. The building was previously identified as the Frank Duguid Residence on the Inventory. Through the application to designate process, it was discovered that (the Bugis family) has owned the property since 1935. The Heritage Conservation team felt it was appropriate to apply a new name to the building through the designation process to reflect the 85-year history of the Bugis family’s ownership. It is also worth noting that the owners had received approval for demolition of the house in 2018. However, after considering the long ownership of their family, and discovering the financial incentives available from the City to designate and rehabilitate the building, they decided to preserve the structure as a contribution to the history of the Strathcona neighbourhood. On December 9, 2020, the owners completed the application requirements to have the Bugis Residence, located at 9851 - 83 Avenue NW, designated as a Municipal Historic Resource under the provisions of City Policy C450B. If designated, any future renovation of the Bugis Residence will be required to meet the Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada . The designation of this property will support its proper restoration and continued protection in the future. BUDGET/FINANCIAL If the Bylaw is approved, and upon completion of the project phases as outlined in Attachment 5, the Heritage Resources Reserve will pay the owner up to $75,000 for rehabilitation. The current Reserve balance is sufficient to cover the committed funding, including the Bugis Residence. The total estimated cost of the restoration work for the project is $150,683.48. Beyond the $75,000 grant from the Heritage Resources Reserve, the owner is responsible for all costs of the restoration work for the project. The projections for the Reserve (using current commitments) anticipate a Reserve balance of $3,157,011.14 at the end of 2020. Administration is considering a number of potential heritage designations for use of these funds, which will be brought forward for Council approval as required. Based on the current commitments, the Reserve balance is anticipated to decline to a balance of $699,188.17 at the end of 2021. The 2 s.17(1) Reserve is funded by the tax levy on an annua","l basis ($2.3 million in 2019 including $418,000 specifically for the Edmonton Brewing and Malting Company Ltd).

This initial shipment will be used to immunize residents at long-term care and designated supportive living facilities beginning with those at highest risk, as the Moderna vaccine can be more readily transported to continuing care sites. Immunization of residents in continuing care facilities was to start on December 30. Premier Jason Kenney said by the end of day December 29, 7,000 front-line health-care workers will have been immunized. He also stated that the province will not reach its initial goal of vaccinating 29,000 workers by the end of the year. As more shipments of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines arrive in early January, immunization will focus on residents of long-term care and designated supportive living facilities, followed by seniors aged 75 and over and residents aged 65 and over of First Nations reserve communities and Métis settlements. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses. Immunization of respiratory therapists, intensive care physicians and staff, and long-term care and designated supportive living facility workers across Alberta will continue. Phase 2 of immunizations is still expected to start by April 2021. Final decisions regarding the sequencing of populations to receive the vaccine in Phase 2 have not yet been determined. Phase 3 will involve rolling out vaccinations to the general Alberta population and is anticipated to start later in 2021.

This initial shipment will be used to immunize residents at long-term care and designated supportive living facilities beginning with those at highest risk, as the Moderna vaccine can be more readily transported to continuing care sites. Immunization of residents in continuing care facilities was to start on December 30. Premier Jason Kenney said by the end of day December 29, 7,000 front-line health-care workers will have been immunized. He also stated that the province will not reach its initial goal of vaccinating 29,000 workers by the end of the year. As more shipments of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines arrive in early January, immunization will focus on residents of long-term care and designated supportive living facilities, followed by seniors aged 75 and over and residents aged 65 and over of First Nations reserve communities and Métis settlements. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses. Immunization of respiratory therapists, intensive care physicians and staff, and long-term care and designated supportive living facility workers across Alberta will continue. Phase 2 of immunizations is still expected to start by April 2021. Final decisions regarding the sequencing of populations to receive the vaccine in Phase 2 have not yet been determined. Phase 3 will involve rolling out vaccinations to the general Alberta population and is anticipated to start later in 2021.

Push-plate i nstallation i s being rolled out i n a phased manner, and began earlier this week at Bay/Enterprise Square LRT Station, as a way to further enhance safety on transit for passengers and staff. The push-plates are flat, made of highly compressed salt and safe to touch. They l ook and feel j ust l ike a ceramic tile. The push-plates can be used to manually push open a door. Outbreaker Solutions has p ublished their research t hat shows the push-plates are effective i n killing the majority of germs, i ncluding viruses, bacteria and fungi i n j ust a few seconds, due to the salt crystals piercing the membrane walls of the germs, effectively neutralizing them. Based on results from the push-plates at Bay/Enterprise Square LRT Station, along with citizen feedback, i t i s anticipated that push-plates will be i nstalled at n ine other transit facilities over the next month. This pilot project will l ast six months, i s at no cost to taxpayers and i s a great example of how local i nnovation can support enhanced safety on transit. In addition to the many COVID-19 safety enhancements already i mplemented on transit, new antimicrobial seats will be i nstalled on nearly two thirds of the LRT fleet from l ate-January until March. These seats will have an antimicrobial additive i n the plastic that can reduce up to 99.9 percent of microbes within two hours. T his additive i s a one-time application i ncorporated i nto the plastic and is not a coating. It will not need to be replaced and should last the entire life of the seat. ETS i s considering using this additive for any further seat replacement on the buses and LRT. .../2 Office of the Deputy City Manager City Operations Memorandum January 20, 2021 Reference No.: 384187872-001 To: City Council Executive Leadership Team From: Gord Cebryk, P.

HERA is a residential energy efficiency incentive program designed to facilitate home renovations that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save energy and support local renovation businesses. Participating homeowners hire qualified energy advisors to perform home energy audits to better understand their home’s energy efficiency and inform their renovation decisions. Insulation, windows, water and space heating equipment are all eligible for rebates with bonuses available for more significant energy retrofits. By investing in energy efficiency improvements, homeowners will realize cost savings from reduced energy bills and improved energy efficiency while helping Edmonton remain within the community carbon budget of 135 megatonnes committed to within The City Plan. HERA adds to the City’s incentive programs including the Building Energy Retrofit Accelerator (BERA) program for commercial and institutional buildings and Residential Solar Rebate Program which are part of Edmonton’s Community Energy Transition Strategy and were funded in the 2019-22 budget.

In Edmonton, mobile homes are located in mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions. In a mobile home park, the landlord owns the site and rents the lots to residents who own or rent the individual mobile homes. In a mobile home subdivision, the homeowner owns both the home and the land. Edmonton has three major mobile home parks and a number of smaller subdivision sites. Legislative Tools Mobile home parks in Edmonton are impacted by different types of provincial and municipal legislation. In addition to external enforcement groups, mobile home parks function similarly to condo boards and can enforce their own rules and regulations. The Mobile Home Sites Tenancies Act and associated regulations apply to tenancies of mobile home sites and establish the rights and responsibilities of a landlord and tenant under these tenancies. These provincial regulations apply to a tenant who is renting a mobile home on a mobile home site. Administration addresses bylaw concerns in mobile home parks in the same manner as other bylaw complaints. Since 2014, Administration has received 515 complaints related to mobile home parks with the majority being nuisance pet-related concerns such as excessive barking, dogs at-large, and defecation issues. Not all bylaw complaints can be adequately dealt with given the unique nature of multiple tenants and a single landowner. In many cases, recourse can only be found against the landowner, not the tenant. In some cases, concerns are of a private or civil nature and are referred back to the resident to contact the mobile home park management company or seek other legal remedies. Jurisdictional Scan Administration reviewed the provincial and municipal regulations in several other jurisdictions. At the municipal level, Administration found that other than zoning regulations, there are no specific municipal bylaws written exclusively for mobile home parks. In Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer, Winnipeg and Ottawa, municipal enforcement systems and operational policies fall under community standard-type bylaws that apply to mobile home parks. Given the private nature of park ownership, municipalities refer the responsibility for site care and maintenance to the landlord in the same way as a condominium board would. Office of the Deputy City Manager CITIZEN SERVICES Memorandum - 2 - In contrast, Ontario and British Columbia have a provincial compliance and enforcement unit whose primary purpose is compliance with tenancy law. The unit works closely with local government compliance units and other public bodies that conduct law enforcement activities to ensure the rights of landlords and renters are protected. Currently, no such unit exists in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba. Access to Provincial Dispute Resolution Services Alberta’s Mobile Home Sites Tenancies Act sets out processes to address tenancy disputes concerning rent, damages, compensation recovery or termination of an agreement. The jurisdictional scan found the most common mechanism for tenants and landowners was to take legal action. The current mechanisms in place were found to be under review by a number of municipalities and provinces, including Alberta, for better no or low-cost remedial alternatives. On May 12, 2020, an updated Mobile Home Sites Tenancies Amendment Act came into effect, which provides tenants of mobile home sites access to this service. Tenants and landlords would still be able to use the courts for disputes valued at over $50,000 and for issues that cannot be resolved through the Residential Tenancy Dispute Resolution Service. Other Dispute Resolution Options There are other dispute resolution services available for citizens with landlord concerns. The City’s Tenant Support Services provides education, mediation and dispute resolution services. The service also provides advice and information to residential tenants and landlords to address tenancy issues and ensures that both tenants and landlords are aware of their rights and obligations under existing legislation.

HERA is a residential energy efficiency incentive program designed to facilitate home renovations that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save energy and support local renovation businesses. Participating homeowners hire qualified energy advisors to perform home energy audits to better understand their home’s energy efficiency and inform their renovation decisions. Insulation, windows, water and space heating equipment are all eligible for rebates with bonuses available for more significant energy retrofits. By investing in energy efficiency improvements, homeowners will realize cost savings from reduced energy bills and improved energy efficiency while helping Edmonton remain within the community carbon budget of 135 megatonnes committed to within The City Plan. HERA adds to the City’s incentive programs including the Building Energy Retrofit Accelerator (BERA) program for commercial and institutional buildings and Residential Solar Rebate Program which are part of Edmonton’s Community Energy Transition Strategy and were funded in the 2019-22 budget.

As you know, a reduction of more than 300 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions was required to achieve a zero-per-cent tax increase for 2021. A substantial portion of that number has already been achieved through strategies such as vacancy management and the Workforce Transition Program that invited senior employees to voluntarily retire or resign by December 18, 2020. Unfortunately, though, some employees in each department will be impacted in this first round of workforce reductions. Starting last week, we began the process of notifying approximately 80 staff members impacted by program efficiencies and budget reductions. This process, which will unfold over several weeks, includes approximately 60 permanent layoffs. About one quarter of these layoffs are management or out of scope. The process will also include transitions to alternate positions. Please remember that Budget, Reimagine and other organization restructuring initiatives will lead to further workforce reductions over the course of 2021. The layoff process will respect the City's collective agreements with our union partners and the employee rights those agreements contain. As prescribed by collective agreements, more senior employees impacted by position reductions have an option to accept an alternate position at the same or lower level, which could ultimately affect a series of other employees before a final layoff notice is given to the most junior employee within the same classification of work in their work area. 1 This is a stressful time for all employees in the City. Consistent with our Cultural Commitments, we are approaching this work with respect, courtesy and care for each other and we are ensuring the proper supports are in place. In addition to these permanent layoffs, approximately 1,600 staff members, mostly from the Community and Recreation Facilities Branch, remain on temporary layoff. Our union partners from CUPE, CSU and ATU have signed a letter of understanding to allow us to extend the temporary layoffs so we can avoid a permanent layoff situation with that group until April 30, 2021. Later this afternoon, Kim Armstrong, Deputy City Manager of Employee Services, will provide brief comments to the media, confirming that we are implementing the commitments we made in the budget update. We will provide Council with an update when this stage of the process is complete. Al.It/ 2",,"No",,,

Andre also sat down for a T o The Point i n-depth i nterview to discuss similar topics. COVID-19 IMMUNIZATIONS The Government of Alberta has administered 95,243 doses of COVID-19 vaccine as of January 19. Due to i nterruptions i n vaccine supply, no new first dose appointments will be booked for the next few weeks. Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health, s aid Tuesday he was ""extremely concerned"" by the news that Pfizer will decrease the amount of COVID-19 vaccine coming to Canada from i ts factory i n Belgium, with no doses expected to arrive next week and further anticipated reductions i n the following two weeks. With fewer vaccines arriving the focus will be on delivering second doses for those who have already been vaccinated. All new first-dose appointments for eligible health-care workers are being postponed and some second-dose appointments will also need to be rescheduled. Vaccine supply has been reserved to ensure the province can provide second doses to all l ong-term care and designated supportive l iving residents. It i s believed Alberta Health Services will also be able to provide second doses to healthcare workers within the established window. On Wednesday, D r.

COVID-19 IMMUNIZATIONS The Government of Alberta has administered 95,243 doses of COVID-19 vaccine as of January 19. Due to i nterruptions i n vaccine supply, no new first dose appointments will be booked for the next few weeks. Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health, s aid Tuesday he was ""extremely concerned"" by the news that Pfizer will decrease the amount of COVID-19 vaccine coming to Canada from i ts factory i n Belgium, with no doses expected to arrive next week and further anticipated reductions i n the following two weeks. With fewer vaccines arriving the focus will be on delivering second doses for those who have already been vaccinated. All new first-dose appointments for eligible health-care workers are being postponed and some second-dose appointments will also need to be rescheduled. Vaccine supply has been reserved to ensure the province can provide second doses to all l ong-term care and designated supportive l iving residents. It i s believed Alberta Health Services will also be able to provide second doses to healthcare workers within the established window. On Wednesday, D r. Deena Hinshaw announced that Alberta’s positivity rate has dropped below five percent for the first time i n nearly 12 weeks.

This seems at l east i n part to the Institute referencing i ncorrect reports and i gnoring key City financial processes such as the four-year budget and regular budget updates for Council. CD Howe did not reach out to the Administration for i nput to the report. City of Edmonton Position: The Administration has reached out to the CD Howe Institute to share our concerns. We invite CD Howe to collaborate with us as an ally for transparency i n government finances. Key Messages: ● We are disappointed i n the CD Howe Institute. We believe their process i s flawed and i ts scoring i s not reflective of the City’s robust and transparent budgetary process and practices. ● We believe that i n some cases CD Howe i s referencing the wrong documents. ● Other municipalities agree with the shortcomings of the CD Howe methodology. The Municipal Finance Officers Association has formally expressed concern. ● Council sets municipal budgets i n public following a public hearing, which i s a very transparent and open approach compared to other orders of government. ● Other third-party reviews of City finances have been very positive. Standard and Poors maintained the City’s credit rating i n 2020 (AA with a stable outlook) despite the financial i mpacts of the pandemic, acknowledging the City’s efforts to mitigate lower revenue through cost cutting. ● The City i s always l ooking to i mprove transparency. We believe, however, that following the principles suggested by CD Howe’s scoring criteria would actually reduce transparency and i n some cases, violate accounting standards. Communication Approach: The Administration will respond to media i nquiries as needed. Background: Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing Date: January 22, 2021 Tracking number: 2021-01 Attention: Mayor, Council, ELT Copy to: Council and ELT assistants, Stacey Padbury, 311, Communications and Engagement The CD Howe Institute has produced this type of report for several years, and municipalities have consistently called for i mprovements to the process. CD Howe’s criticism of the City of Edmonton i ncludes: ● It claims that our 2020 budget was approved 17 weeks l ate referencing April 27, 2020. This date references the approval of the Spring 2020 Supplemental Operating Budget Adjustment with no recognition to the approval of the budget i n December 2019 and overlooks the approval of the four-year budget i n 2018.) ● Scoring the page of “headline” appears to penalize municipalities that publish an annual report with a narrative that explains the use of public funds rather than a plain set of financial statements. ● The report penalizes the City for reporting net expenditures only , but i n fact the City presents i ts both gross and net numbers i n i ts budget document. We believe that i t is appropriate to outline the gross revenues and gross expenditures and show the net expenditures. ● The report did not reference the annual F inancial Report to Citizens. The City of Edmonton has consistently received many awards the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) for many years, i ncluding: ○ Canadian Award for Financial Reporting to the City of Edmonton (26 consecutive years) ○ Popular Annual Financial Reporting Awards Program for the City of Edmonton's 2018 Financial Report to Citizens (six consecutive years) ○ Award for Distinguished Budget Presentation for the City of Edmonton's 2019-2022 budget document Media coverage: ● Calgary Herald and the F inancial Post: P osthaste: How did your city score?

As you know, a reduction of more than 300 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions was required to achieve a zero-per-cent tax increase for 2021. A substantial portion of that number has already been achieved through strategies such as vacancy management and the Workforce Transition Program that invited senior employees to voluntarily retire or resign by December 18, 2020. Unfortunately, though, some employees in each department will be impacted in this first round of workforce reductions. Starting last week, we began the process of notifying approximately 80 staff members impacted by program efficiencies and budget reductions. This process, which will unfold over several weeks, includes approximately 60 permanent layoffs. About one quarter of these layoffs are management or out of scope. The process will also include transitions to alternate positions. Please remember that Budget, Reimagine and other organization restructuring initiatives will lead to further workforce reductions over the course of 2021. The layoff process will respect the City's collective agreements with our union partners and the employee rights those agreements contain. As prescribed by collective agreements, more senior employees impacted by position reductions have an option to accept an alternate position at the same or lower level, which could ultimately affect a series of other employees before a final layoff notice is given to the most junior employee within the same classification of work in their work area. 1 This is a stressful time for all employees in the City. Consistent with our Cultural Commitments, we are approaching this work with respect, courtesy and care for each other and we are ensuring the proper supports are in place. In addition to these permanent layoffs, approximately 1,600 staff members, mostly from the Community and Recreation Facilities Branch, remain on temporary layoff. Our union partners from CUPE, CSU and ATU have signed a letter of understanding to allow us to extend the temporary layoffs so we can avoid a permanent layoff situation with that group until April 30, 2021. Later this afternoon, Kim Armstrong, Deputy City Manager of Employee Services, will provide brief comments to the media, confirming that we are implementing the commitments we made in the budget update. We will provide Council with an update when this stage of the process is complete. Al.It/ 2",,"No",,,

The parkland change process is used to establish a rink on the land licensed to them through the Tripartite Agreement. Once approval is obtained through the parkland change process, no additional permissions are required to create or operate the rink in future years. Other community groups can also create and operate outdoor rinks on parkland but must obtain a licence from the City to do so. To initiate the development of a rink and obtain the necessary approvals, groups may call 311 to connect with their Neighbourhood Resource Coordinator to guide them through the process. The establishment and operation of these rinks require a new license each year. Before a rink and/or freezeway can proceed, Administration will assist the group to identify the appropriate location and will inspect the rink before it can be operated. The groups must also agree to follow Parkland Bylaw 2202 and provide proof of a minimum of $2,000,000 in liability insurance.

The parkland change process is used to establish a rink on the land licensed to them through the Tripartite Agreement. Once approval is obtained through the parkland change process, no additional permissions are required to create or operate the rink in future years. Other community groups can also create and operate outdoor rinks on parkland but must obtain a licence from the City to do so. To initiate the development of a rink and obtain the necessary approvals, groups may call 311 to connect with their Neighbourhood Resource Coordinator to guide them through the process. The establishment and operation of these rinks require a new license each year. Before a rink and/or freezeway can proceed, Administration will assist the group to identify the appropriate location and will inspect the rink before it can be operated. The groups must also agree to follow Parkland Bylaw 2202 and provide proof of a minimum of $2,000,000 in liability insurance.

The buildings are both listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources in Edmonton. The development permit application also proposes the demolition of the circa 1940s Rochester Apartments on the same site, which is not listed on the Inventory. The El Mirador Apartments were built in a number of phases on what used to be three lots. The complex was begun in 1935, when an existing 1912 house on the north lot was altered and a three-story addition was built on the front, extending the building to the property line at 108 Street. The house is still visible on the north side of the building. A second addition around 1937 was built directly behind the original building and formed the U-shaped courtyard, facing south. Around 1941, another wing was constructed, sitting on the centre lot, set back from the street and connected to the rear of the 1937 addition. In 1953, the Patricia Annex was built on the southernmost lot, adjoining the 1941 addition. The Patricia Annex was built to 108 Street and complements the 1935 addition in its design, form and scale. The group of structures are finished in white stucco with red trim, reflecting the popularity of the Spanish Revival style for buildings at the time. Though the complex was built over several years, there are many details that indicate it should be viewed as a whole. Examples of this include the scale and composition of the buildings, a red square motif below the parapet, and the facade’s tower-like end bays which both feature central gables and tall windows illuminating the interior staircases. The building also features arched balconies and iron spiral staircases. The structures are situated around a central courtyard with verandahs facing inward. El Mirador Apartments was owned, designed, and developed by Ralph Henry Trouth, who also lived in the building. Trouth was born in Iowa in 1887 and received his architectural training in Alberta. He trained with Magoon & Macdonald, a highly influential architectural firm in the early 20th century. Trouth also added the 1940 addition; his son, Norman, added the Patricia Annex in 1953. The Trouth family lived in the building until they sold it in 1964. There were few buildings of this style built in Edmonton and even fewer are still standing, making this a rare example of this form of multi-unit development in Edmonton. The property owner has consolidated a number of lots on the block and intends to build a multi-unit housing building consisting of a 13-storey podium with 2 towers on the northwest and southeast corners of the podium. The building will contain a total of 941 dwellings, general retail stores on the main floor and second floor, and 5 storeys of underground parkade. The property was rezoned to (DC2) Site Specific Development Control Provision (DC2 1068) in July 2019. The property owner has been informed of the financial incentives available to them should they choose to restore and designate the El Mirador Apartments and the Patricia Annex complex as a Municipal Historic Resource. They have also satisfied the Special Information Requirements for documenting historic resources listed on the Inventory of Historic Resources as per Edmonton Zoning Bylaw 12800. As a reminder to City Council, the Historical Resources Act provides a municipality with the authority to designate a structure as a Municipal Historic Resource without the owner’s consent.However, the Act further requires that the owner of the structure be provided compensation for any decrease in economic value, should the City designate a building without the owner’s consent. c: Executive Leadership Team Kim Petrin, Branch Manager, Development Services Aileen Giesbrecht, City Clerk, Office of the City Clerk Attachments",,"No",,,

This press release: 1) States that TransEd has revised the VLSE service commencement date to some time between October 15 and December 15 2021. 2) Indicates that DBRS is re-evaluating TransEd’s bond rating, and may downgrade it further. 3) States that TransEd’s lenders await a remedial plan from TransEd to bring the forecasted service commencement date back before October 15, 2021. In early February, Administration was informed of TransEd's revised construction schedule, which included a forecast Service Commencement Date of December 2021. We are currently reviewing this schedule for contractual compliance. City of Edmonton Position: Administration considers this situation to be a commercial issue between TransEd and its lenders, but is monitoring the situation closely. The City remains committed to working with TransEd to ensure the Valley Line Stage 1 opens for safe and reliable service as soon as possible. Administration will share a forecast service commencement date publicly when we are confident all obligations can be met by that time and the project will be delivered to the City’s quality and safety standard. Key Messages: Finance: ● This release highlights one of the financial tools used to hold TransEd accountable for their timelines on the Valley Line Southeast project. ○ Pressure from the private lenders incentivizes TransEd to finish work on the project in a timely manner and according to the project requirements. ○ Further, TransEd does not receive the capital repayment and operating payments expected from the City for the period that the project is delayed. This document is exempt from disclosure as per Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act , RSA 2000, c F-25, s 24. This document contains “advice, proposals, recommendations, analyses or policy options developed by or for a public body” Integrated Marketing Communications COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT Confidential Issue Briefing Date: February 22, 2021 Tracking number: 2021-02 Attention: Mayor, Council, ELT Copy to: Mayor’s Office staff, Council and ELT assistants, Communications and Engagement DCMO, Bruce Ferguson, Brad Smid ● This downgrade affects TransEd’s credit rating with its lenders and doesn’t have any financial impact on citizens of Edmonton or construction costs, which were locked in at the start of the project. ● Administration considers this situation to be a commercial issue between TransEd and its lenders, but is monitoring the situation closely. Project Delivery: ● The City is disappointed that this project will not be delivered when Edmontonians expected it, but we’ve seen measurable progress throughout the past year and we continue to work with TransEd to get the Valley Line Southeast finished. ● The City will continue to track TransEd’s schedule performance and share it with Edmontonians. ● The City is committed to managing its contractors effectively to deliver high quality infrastructure projects for Edmontonians, and that remains our primary focus. Approach : Communications will monitor media interest in the DBRS release. Background: In June 2020 DBRS downgraded TransEd’s bonds from BBB (high) to BBB (low), and shared TransEd’s revised service commencement date of September 23, 2021. A previous rating downgrade also took place in December 2018. Neither of the related press releases were picked up by the media. TransEd’s progress on the project has been trending behind schedule, as reported in the Valley Line Southeast Quarterly Progress Reports, available on the City of Edmonton Valley Line Southeast website .
