Current construction activities includes utility relocations between 156 Street and 142 Street, and the installation of drainage infrastructure between 142 Street and 156 Street. Replacement of the Dovercourt noise wall is underway as well. It is anticipated that access to Yellowhead Trail eastbound from 142 Street will be restored by the end of 2022. Yellowhead Trail has been reduced to 2 travel lanes in both directions to accommodate construction in the area. In addition, the following traffic impacts are in place until later fall of 2022: westbound Yellowhead Trail 156 Street off-ramp closures,149 Street closure between Yellowhead Trail and 128 Avenue, westbound traffic under St. Albert Trail has been crossed over to the eastbound side to allow for construction under the north end of the bridge.
