This project includes the removal of the existing at-grade intersections at 149 Street and 142 Street, construction of one-way service roads parallel to Yellowhead Trail to provide access to existing businesses and roadways, as well as construction of minor improvements to the existing 156 Street and St. Albert Trail interchanges. 149 Street and 142 Street will have right-in/right-out access to the new service road, which provides access to the new freeway.<h3>Latest Update:</h3>Construction of the 156 Street to St. Albert Trail project began in June 2021 and will continue through to the end of 2023. Current construction activities includes utility relocations between 156 Street and 142 Street, and the installation of drainage infrastructure between 142 Street and 156 Street. Replacement of the Dovercourt noise wall is underway as well. It is anticipated that access to Yellowhead Trail eastbound from 142 Street will be restored by the end of 2022. Yellowhead Trail has been reduced to 2 travel lanes in both directions to accommodate construction in the area. In addition, the following traffic impacts are in place until later fall of 2022: westbound Yellowhead Trail 156 Street off-ramp closures,149 Street closure between Yellowhead Trail and 128 Avenue, westbound traffic under St. Albert Trail has been crossed over to the eastbound side to allow for construction under the north end of the bridge.
