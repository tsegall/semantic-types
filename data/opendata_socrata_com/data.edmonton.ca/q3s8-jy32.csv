Not all trap collection sites are factored into the historical averages. Some data can be incomplete due to trap failure. Some trap locations change over time. Trap collections reflect, not absolute population levels, but mosquito activity, which is influenced by changing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). The weekly averages do not include any male mosquitoes or any females of species that do not typically bite people. Each data set reflects the mosquito activity of the week previous to the collection date.

An approved development permit is required before application for a building permit to construct the building or structure, or to apply for a business licence.

The reference system consists of six PV modules arranged at fixed angles on the roof of the Shaw Theatre at NAIT’s Main Campus, near the corner of Princess Elizabeth Avenue and 106 Street. The angles correspond to those typically used for solar installations in Edmonton. Each of the six modules is paired with a duplicate module placed at exactly the same angle. During the winter months, snow will be cleared from the left side of the modules. By pairing modules at exactly the same angles, researchers will be able to compare the effect of snow clearing versus snow cover on energy production.

The degree angle of rows are 90, 53, 45, 27, 18, 14 degree. You can find the actual picture at the ""About"" tab. In the dataset column name, 90_LEFT means the left panel and 90 degree angle and so on.

Estimated volumes are derived from growth factors at permanent counting sites. The growth factors are applied to the most recent actual AAWDT volume at a given location.

Seasonal Adjustments
Volumes are based on counts of one or two day duration (usually completed between May to June and September to October) and are adjusted to reflect an average weekday during the year. Adjustments are based on variations by time of year measured at permanent count locations that monitor traffic year round.

Year to Year Volume Changes ‐ Interpretation of Results
An increase or decrease in volume does not necessarily indicate a trend for a given roadway. Some areas may record a temporary change in volume due to the reconstruction of a roadway link. Although every attempt is made to avoid counting areas while diversions are in effect, some roadway projects affect traffic patterns for a long period of time and are reflected in the counts. For example, the 2011 construction program included Scona Road, the interchange at 23 Avenue/Gateway Boulevard, widening of the Quesnell Bridge, overpasses for major links of the West Anthony Henday, and interchanges for the north Anthony Henday.","3066","traffic,volumes,aawdt","473","published","City of Edmonton","Geographic","Internal","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/b58q-nxjr.json","NAD 83","Annually",

Locations selected for enforcement may be removed or added as determined by weather, road conditions, roadway closures or construction, equipment issues or other unforeseen circumstances.

Each enforcement site has one or more reasons for why enforcement is taking place. The list of reasons are:

a) Areas or intersections where conventional enforcement is unsafe or ineffective;
b) Areas or intersections with an identifiable, documented history of collisions;
c) Areas or intersections with an identifiable, documented history of speeding problems;
d) Intersections with an identifiable, documented history of offences;

DATA NOTES (from http://covid19stats.alberta.ca):
The Provincial Surveillance Information system (PSI) is a laboratory surveillance system which receives positive results for all Notifiable Diseases and diseases under laboratory surveillance from Alberta Precision Labs (APL). The system also receives negative results for a subset of organisms such as COVID-19. The system contains basic information on characteristics and demographics such as age, zone and gender.
Recovered is based on the assumption that a case is recovered 14 days after a particular date. For confirmed cases, we used specimen collected date and for probable cases, this is the date reported to Alberta Health.
Information such as hospitalizations and ICU admissions are received through enhanced case report forms sent by Alberta Health Services (AHS).
Disclaimer: The content and format of this report are subject to change. Cases are under investigation and numbers may fluctuate as cases are resolved. Data included in the interactive data application are up-to-date as of midday of the date of posting.","1233","covid-19,ahs","376","published","Alberta Health Services",,"Externally Sourced Data","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/jmcu-tz8y.json",,"X times per day",

Development permits approve the use of a site, as well as the size and location of any buildings or structures. It is written approval from the City that development plans meet the Edmonton Zoning Bylaw regulations. An approved development permit is required before application for a building permit to construct the building or structure, or to apply for a business licence.

Some permits are combination permits. They combine both a development permit and a building permit in one application. This data set only represents the outcome of the development permit application. Building permit data is available through the General Building Permits dataset.

Latitude: 53.503477
Longitude: -113.558887

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","74","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","270","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/k2ir-wp6d.json",,"Weekly",

Estimated volumes are derived from growth factors at permanent counting sites. The growth factors are applied to the most recent actual AAWDT volume at a given location.

Seasonal Adjustments
Volumes are based on counts of one or two day duration (usually completed between May to June and September to October) and are adjusted to reflect an average weekday during the year. Adjustments are based on variations by time of year measured at permanent count locations that monitor traffic year round.

Year to Year Volume Changes ‐ Interpretation of Results
An increase or decrease in volume does not necessarily indicate a trend for a given roadway. Some areas may record a temporary change in volume due to the reconstruction of a roadway link. Although every attempt is made to avoid counting areas while diversions are in effect, some roadway projects affect traffic patterns for a long period of time and are reflected in the counts. For example, the 2011 construction program included Scona Road, the interchange at 23 Avenue/Gateway Boulevard, widening of the Quesnell Bridge, overpasses for major links of the West Anthony Henday, and interchanges for the north Anthony Henday.","2294","traffic,volumes,aawdt","245","published","City of Edmonton","Geographic",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/9zk6-5p8r.json","NAD 83","Annually",

Latitude: 53.5412
Longitude: -113.45524

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","74","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","226","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/yktk-kdr7.json",,"Weekly",

Latitude: 53.575155
Longitude: -113.53594

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","75","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","186","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/iz46-fdn8.json",,"Weekly",

At time of publication, the uPLVI coverage included the City of Edmonton and a 3.2 km buffer. The uPLVI follows the framework of, and can be integrated with, the Province of Alberta’s Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (PLVI).  In order to capture the unique variation found in large urban settings the Provincial PLVI landcover types were modified. To provide more land-cover information within urban settings seventeen Site Types were added to the Provincial PLVI classification.  In addition, Seven PLVI Site Types were deemed inapplicable for urban settings. Ecological conditions in the uPLVI are interpreted specific to the availability of moisture and nutrients to plants (i.e. Moisture Regime & Nutrient Regime), using site factors and vegetation species as indicators. A polygon may be a-spatially attributed with up to 3 ecological conditions, depending on complexity and extent.

Over the past decade, City policy has shifted to manage natural areas with consideration of their role within an ecological network. Today, a goal of the City is to protect, preserve and enhance a functioning ecological network throughout the city limits. This network should include lands in both the river valley and the Tablelands.

To further this goal, a model was developed in 2015 for determining environmental sensitivity scores across the entirety of the city. This model guided the collection of several digital data layers with coverage across the entire study area (including several ecological assets, threats to assets, and development and cultural constraints). Data layers were then used to develop spatial outputs that summarized the distribution of these assets, threats and constraints. These base layers have been compiled into this dataset to help inform planning, development and conservation throughout Edmonton.

Environmental sensitivity analysis incorporated recent mapping of the ecological network of native and non-native vegetation, streams, wetlands and other waterbodies as much as possible, with practical limitations. The City’s urban Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (uPLVI) and remote sensing data used for this assessment were completed in 2015 and 2013 respectively, which is relatively recent, but not current. Similarly, infrastructure data (roads, subdivision development and stormwater facilities) provided varied in month of acquisition from 2015. Some discrepancy between mapped and actual features may result, due to loss and changes from ongoing development activities.","678",,"152","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/kme6-3pd6.json",,"Not Updated (Historical Only)",

These collections are from standard New Jersey light traps that are commonly used to record changes in abundance of mosquitoes before and after control campaigns and to compare seasonal and annual fluctuations in population. Since not all mosquito species are attracted equally to light traps, the City uses a variety of other trapping and survey methods (with their own limitations) to monitor mosquitoes. Not all trap collection sites are factored into the historical averages. Some data can be incomplete due to trap failure. Some trap locations change over time. Trap collections reflect, not absolute population levels, but mosquito activity, which is influenced by changing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). The weekly averages do not include any male mosquitoes or any females of species that do not typically bite people. Each data set reflects the mosquito activity of the week previous to the collection date.

To complement this dataset, there is the Rainfall Gauge data which measures rainfall data in the Greater Edmonton area:

An enforcement unit can be found anywhere along the area of the Zone.  An enforcement unit may not be able to operate at the specified zone and subsequently move to a zone that is not scheduled for enforcement.  The centre points are extracted for mapping purposes only and are not intended to imply or suggest that is where the Photo Enforcement is being conducted.  Designated Zones are continuously reviewed, revised, added, removed and otherwise updated in accordance to the guidelines for establishing a Zone for photo enforcement.  Automated enforcement is expected to be operating at the locations indicated. Please be advised that automated enforcement may be used at other locations within Edmonton as well. Locations selected for enforcement may be removed or added as determined by weather, road conditions, roadway closures or construction, equipment issues or other unforeseen circumstances.

Each enforcement site has one or more reasons for why enforcement is taking place. The list of reasons are:

a) Areas or intersections where conventional enforcement is unsafe or ineffective;
b) Areas or intersections with an identifiable, documented history of collisions;
c) Areas or intersections with an identifiable, documented history of speeding problems;
d) Intersections with an identifiable, documented history of offences;
e) Intersections near schools, post-secondary institutions, or other areas with high pedestrian volumes;
f) School and playground zones or areas;
g) Construction zones; or

20 school sites
(https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/urban_planning_and_design/surplus-school-building-sites.aspx)
in 19 neighbourhoods were declared surplus in 2006 and have been designated for the First Place housing program.

Completed projects across Edmonton have allowed many people to realize the dream of home ownership (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/first-place-stories.aspx) while integrating with communities that helped design the look and “fit” of the developments.
These families benefit from the opportunity to call a place their own and get ahead financially, but the community at large benefits too. Owning a home keeps families rooted in neighbourhoods, something that's needed for communities to flourish over time.

The homes are market priced, with a five-year deferral on the land portion of the mortgage, making them more accessible to first time buyers.

A public engagement
(https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/community-engagement-first-place.aspx)
process precedes development, along with opportunities for community involvement in project design.

Latitude: 53.481944
Longitude: -113.413549

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","402","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","109","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/p344-frdg.json",,"Weekly",

Estimated volumes are derived from growth factors at permanent counting sites. The growth factors are applied to the most recent actual AAWDT volume at a given location.

Seasonal Adjustments
Volumes are based on counts of one or two day duration (usually completed between May to June and September to October) and are adjusted to reflect an average weekday during the year. Adjustments are based on variations by time of year measured at permanent count locations that monitor traffic year round.

Year to Year Volume Changes ‐ Interpretation of Results
An increase or decrease in volume does not necessarily indicate a trend for a given roadway. Some areas may record a temporary change in volume due to the reconstruction of a roadway link. Although every attempt is made to avoid counting areas while diversions are in effect, some roadway projects affect traffic patterns for a long period of time and are reflected in the counts. For example, the 2011 construction program included Scona Road, the interchange at 23 Avenue/Gateway Boulevard, widening of the Quesnell Bridge, overpasses for major links of the West Anthony Henday, and interchanges for the north Anthony Henday.","740","traffic,volumes,aawdt","98","published","City of Edmonton","Geographic",,"https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/bdef-2p8k.json","NAD 83","Annually",

in 19 neighbourhoods were declared surplus in 2006 and have been designated for the First Place housing program.

Completed projects across Edmonton have allowed many people to realize the dream of home ownership (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/housing/first-place-stories.aspx) while integrating with communities that helped design the look and “fit” of the developments.
These families benefit from the opportunity to call a place their own and get ahead financially, but the community at large benefits too. Owning a home keeps families rooted in neighbourhoods, something that's needed for communities to flourish over time.

The homes are market priced, with a five-year deferral on the land portion of the mortgage, making them more accessible to first time buyers.

Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

 - Data has been aggregated into in 15 minute intervals
 - Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
 - Speed range/interval for the bins are aligned with the program settings for DFS units that collect data from roadways with the same speed limit

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","125","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","89","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/jb7c-z87u.json",,"Weekly",

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","120","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","88","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/hwfm-v687.json",,"Weekly",

Longitude: -113.485613

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","69","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","86","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/vica-r6ik.json",,"Weekly",

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

There may be slight discrepancies in the data contained in this data set and the results observed in the 2018 Survey Reports provided by TalentMap. This is due to the fact that TalentMap calculates the number of overall respondents for each question in the dimension.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

This map representation was created as a result of a 2013 to 2016 study done for the Edmonton area to determine the vulnerable areas of Edmonton in regards to a 1 in 100 year rainfall event.

Due to the constant changing of subsurface infrastructure (adding, upgrading, etc.) combined with the constant changing definition of a 1 in 100 year rainfall event (based on historic rainfall amounts), this raster file reflects the results of a study done in 2016 and should neither suggest previous year’s vulnerabilities nor future year’s vulnerabilities.

There are four different colours to show the depth of water that might pool on the ground during a large rainstorm.

Those colours are:

Green (representing a ponding depth from 0.00 - 0.35 m)
Yellow (representing a ponding depth from 0.35 - 0.50 m)
Orange (representing a ponding depth from 0.50 to 0.75 m)
Red (representing a ponding depth greater than 0.75 m)

On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.

These benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.

The Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the “Hello, How Are You?” (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school’s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying “Hello, how are you?”

Age Friendly Edmonton Partnership
In a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city.

Alberta Health monitors all supportive living and long-term care accommodations for compliance to the Accommodation Standards, minimally on an annual basis. The purpose of the Accommodation Standards is to ensure accommodations maintain a high quality of accommodation services (e.g. meals, building maintenance, security and housekeeping) that promote the safety, security and quality of life of Albertans living in those accommodations. Alberta Health currently reports publicly on the results of licensing and monitoring visits in supportive living and long-term care facilities across the province at http://standardsandlicensing.alberta.ca. This table provides statistics on supportive living and long-term care facilities and their compliance to the Accommodation Standards since April 1, 2013 as well as licensing and contact information.

USAGE CONSIDERATIONS
The accommodation data is collected from licensed operators through the licensing application process. The compliance data is collected by Licensing Inspectors when they visit accommodations to monitor compliance to the accommodation standards. The data collected is housed in a custom designed database named Accommodation Standards Licensing and Tracking (ASTRAL) System. The accommodation and compliance information from ASTRAL is published to http://standardsandlicensing.alberta.ca in ""real time"". The compliance information dates back to April 1, 2013 until the date of the dataset.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","85","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","74","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/vjjz-62qe.json",,"Weekly",

On June 27, 2017, Buddy Benches were placed in Edmonton neighbourhoods as a pilot project to help turn strangers into neighbours.

These benches are specifically painted to invite people to sit on them all year round. If someone notices a person sitting on a Buddy Bench, they are encouraged to sit with them and start up a conversation.

The Buddy Bench Pilot Project is part of the “Hello, How Are You?” (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/hello-how-are-you.aspx) campaign, which encompasses two council initiatives: the Council Initiative on Urban Isolation and Mental Health (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/urban-isolation-mental-health.aspx) and the Council Initiative on Seniors (https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/for_communities/senior-isolation-loneliness.aspx). The campaign encourages Edmontonians to connect within their communities to help prevent social isolation. The pilot came about after a young boy approached city administration hoping to have his school’s Buddy Bench concept implemented on a larger scale. Thanks to this suggestion, Buddy Benches will allow Edmontonians of all ages to support each other and start up a conversation simply by saying “Hello, how are you?”

In a partnership with Age Friendly Edmonton (https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/initiatives_innovation/age-friendly-edmonton.aspx), we are proud to announce that we have new wooden Buddy Benches around the city.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","42","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","68","published","City of Edmonton","LL-WGS84","Internal ","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/47fm-bgnv.json",,"Weekly",
