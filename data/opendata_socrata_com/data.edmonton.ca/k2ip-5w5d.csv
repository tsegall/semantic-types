It features twelve artists of Asian heritage whose works engage with intersecting narratives, communities, and discursive contexts that navigate the complexities of “Asian-ness” and Asian identities.Some of these artists explore how specific objects and places can become infused with culturally specific meanings that bridge different generations and contribute to a sense of shared heritage. Other artists reveal how intangible things such as language, music, and memories can embody a collective experience or legacy, providing an anchor for redefining or reimagining what it means to belong to a specific community. Some works reshape understandings of “Asian-ness” that have become associated with specific objects and places. The creation of the works themselves becomes a means to make “Asian-ness” visible and to expose its absence in contexts that have rendered “Asian-ness” invisible.This exhibition’s works demonstrate the persistence and resilience of Asian experiences that should be considered, in their own right, as meaningful and valuable for the people who belong to those communities.Enjoy this online multimedia exhibit from June 25th to August 7th!This exhibition is funded with support from the Edmonton Arts Council and the City of Edmonton.Get social with us!Instagram: @artistryprojectsTwitter: @artisteprojectsFacebook: @intersectionsinart",

The Edmonton event features eight skilled athletes fighting for the championship while putting on a spectacle, constantly innovating and always entertaining.
