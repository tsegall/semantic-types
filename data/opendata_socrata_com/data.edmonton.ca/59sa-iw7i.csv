In 1876 he refused to sign Treaty No. 6 because he believed it would destroy his people’s way of life. By 1882, however, the threat of starvation finally forced him to submit to the treaty, and with it, to accept the forced relocation of Aboriginal people onto reserves. He was later blamed for the Frog Lake Massacre of 1885. Despite his innocence, Big Bear surrendered at Fort Carleton and faced treason charges. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years at Stony Mountain Penitentiary. Big Bear served two years of his term before being released because of ill health.

"Big Miller Park","11 Tommy Banks Way","Park","2001","Award-winning jazz trombonist, blues singer and educator Clarence Horatio “Big” Miller (1922-1992) helped found the Edmonton Jazz City Festival and was considered one of the most acclaimed bluesmen in Canada. Miller, the son of a Sioux father and a mother who was the descendant of a black slave, was born at Sioux City, Iowa. A mix of bad luck and unexpected opportunities led to his becoming a proud Canadian citizen in 1973. It was during a tour of Canada in the late 1960s that Miller became stranded in Vancouver. The show he was performing with ran out of money and he was forced to find work in order to pay his way home. One of the gigs he took was at Tommy Banks’ Embers Club in Edmonton. Embraced by the local music community, Miller made several return engagements, eventually staying and becoming an Edmontonian. He went on to make major contributions to not only the city music scene but provincially, through teaching. Over the course of his 50-year career, Miller performed with some of the world’s greatest jazz musicians, including Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Woody Herman. He toured internationally and was a regular performer at Switzerland’s prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival. In 1979 Miller won a Juno for Jazz Canada Montreux 1978, a live album recorded with the Tommy Banks Orchestra. Among his other albums are Live From Calgary (1982), Big Miller and the Blues Machine: Live at Athabasca University (1990) and The Last of the Blues Shouters (1992), recorded in Southampton, England. The National Film Board of Canada recognized Miller’s work with the 1980 biographical film Big and the Blues. In 1985 Miller received an honorary doctorate of humanities from Athabasca University in recognition of his teaching of jazz, blues and gospel music. In addition to his busy performing schedule, Miller taught at the Banff School of Fine Arts, Grant MacEwan College and schools throughout Alberta.","53.521217","-113.495132","(53.521217, -113.495132)"

When Fort Calgary was established in 1875, the NWMP completed the southern leg of this trail from the Lone Pine Stopping House, near Bowden, to Calgary. After the 1883 arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Calgary, the Calgary-Edmonton Trail became a busy supply route with regular mail and stagecoach services. The use of the Trail declined after the completion of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in 1891. Since the advent of the automobile, however, the “Trail” has become the most heavily travelled highway in Alberta.

In the 1870s, the Métis, displaced from their lands around Winnipeg and Red River, Manitoba, followed the buffalo west and settled near the fort. A North West Mounted Police detachment was later dispatched to the fort to keep it secure.

"Decoteau Way ","From Griesbach School Road to Valour Way","Road","2007","Sgt. Alex Wuttunee Decoteau (1887-1917) was an Olympic athlete and Canada’s first Aboriginal police officer. Born on the Red Pheasant Reserve, near Battleford, in present-day Saskatchewan, Decoteau was the only Albertan on the Canadian team that competed in the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. Between 1909 and 1916 Decoteau won nearly every track event in Alberta. In 1911 Decoteau was hired as a police officer by the City of Edmonton. As well as being the first Aboriginal person to hold such a post in Canada, Decoteau is said to have been the country’s first motorcycle policeman. By 1916, when he took leave from the police force to enlist in the Canadian Army, he had reached the rank of sergeant. He continued to run, even while stationed in England. After winning a one-mile race in Salisbury, England, Decoteau was presented with a gold pocket watch by King George V. The watch, taken from the King’s own waistcoat, was a last-minute replacement for a misplaced trophy. Decoteau would never see Canada again. He was hit by a sniper’s bullet and tragically died at the Battle of Passchendaele on October 30, 1917. The German who shot Decoteau stole the gold pocket watch. Days later, the sniper was killed by Decoteau’s fellow soldiers and the watch returned to Decoteau’s mother in Canada. Decoteau was buried at Ypres, northern France. In 1985 friends and relatives of the famed runner held a belated Cree burial service for Decoteau at his birthplace of Red Pheasant Reserve. Band council members, Aboriginal veterans and family members walked to a sacred burial ground where singers chanted a burial song to guide the spirit of the long-dead Decoteau home. With them was a ten-member honour guard from the Edmonton Police Service and Canadian Army personnel. Decoteau was inducted into the City of Edmonton Sports Hall of Fame in 1967, and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

A Métis elder once described Anderson as “the heart of the [Métis] Nation.” In her long and active life, Anderson was a nurse, a teacher and the author of more than 90 books on Métis history and culture and the Cree language. Apart from her language tapes, Anderson was probably best known for her Cree dictionary. She also researched and documented traditional herbal remedies.  Anderson was one of ten children born to Elizabeth “Betsy” Callihou and William Joseph Gairdner on the river lot they farmed east of St. Albert. Her parents were of Cree, French and Scottish descent. Anderson attended school to Grade 10 and then worked on the family farm. After marrying and having two children, she moved to Edmonton in the mid-1940s and became a nurses’ aide.  After 15 years of nursing, Anderson began what was to be her most important work – the preservation of the Cree language. Recalling the dying words of her convent-raised mother, Anderson set out to record and teach the Cree language. She founded Cree Productions, which published Cree dictionaries and instructional materials. She also served on the Alberta Cultural Heritage Council. She initiated Cree classes at schools and centres across Canada and lectured at the University of Alberta, Grant MacEwan Community College, Fairview College, the Charles Camsell Hospital and Fort Saskatchewan Correctional Facility.  Anderson received the Native Council of Canada Award, an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Alberta and the Order of Canada. Among her many books were The First Métis…A New Nation which documented the history of the Métis in Alberta. Anderson died at the age of 91.

"Fort Road","115 Avenue and 86 Street northeast to 227 Avenue NE and 17 Street NE","Road","1962","The original Fort Road was little more than a dirt track. It was part of the fur trade trail system stretching east to Lower Fort Garry (Winnipeg). Known as the Carlton Trail after Fort Carlton, located midway along the route, it was established in the mid-1800s. By the 1880s, Fort Road had gained importance as the trail connecting the booming communities of Fort Saskatchewan and Fort Edmonton. The journey was considered a difficult one, with lengthy diversions to avoid swamps and other hazards. In 1883, a resting place for weary travellers, known as the Halfway House, was built northeast of Fort Edmonton. Fort Road was a crucial link between the two forts and traffic was heavy: on just one morning in 1905, 175 teams were said to be on the trail. The route was gravelled in 1926 and oiled in 1930. It has also been known as Fort Saskatchewan Road, Fort Saskatchewan Trail and Fort Trail. Fort Road, as it is now known, originally wound its way from Jasper Avenue through northeast Edmonton to Fort Saskatchewan. One of the earliest published references to its existence is an 1884 report in the Edmonton Bulletin newspaper in which the roadway was referred to as the “old” Fort Saskatchewan Trail. Fort Saskatchewan is located about 35 kilometres northeast of Edmonton. The North West Mounted Police established Fort Saskatchewan in 1875, making it the force’s second post (the first was Fort Macleod) and the first in the region. When the national transcontinental railway was first surveyed in the 1870s, a more northerly route was being considered. For a time it was thought that Fort Saskatchewan would become the major centre in the vicinity, much to the displeasure of Fort Edmonton. In an attempt to ensure Canadian sovereignty north of the 49th Parallel, another path was chosen, and in 1883 the Canadian Pacific Railway’s route took it through Calgary to the south. Fort Saskatchewan became a town in 1904 and a city in 1985.","53.583156","-113.447614","(53.583156, -113.447614)"

The terms of this agreement allowed the HBC to retain parcels of land around each of its posts. These lands became known as Hudson’s Bay Reserves.

In addition to land, the HBC received £300,000, and title to one-twentieth of all farmland within the territory, some 2.8 million hectares of land in all. The Hudson’s Bay Reserve was eventually sold to settlers, the first lots being put up for sale by the HBC as early as 1883. On May 13, 1912, the company sold the remainder of its substantial Edmonton properties by public lottery. Despite attempts to keep the location secret, more than 2,000 people lined up for the sale; the HBC received $3.4 million from the sale of some 1,500 lots. The excitement surrounding the release of the Hudson’s Bay Reserve lots marked the peak of the land boom. A year later the overheated land market crashed; the recession that followed lasted until the mid-1920s.","53.547448","-113.500013","(53.547448, -113.500013)"

The bone fragments found here suggest the nomads came to this site to hunt bison and other animals. The ravine site was first settled in 1875 by Rev. Cannon William Newton, who was forced to build his church and hospital on this site because he could not get along with officials at Fort Edmonton, 14 kilometres to the west. The Anglican minister called it the Hermitage because of its remote location, and the name stuck. The lilac rows he planted can still be seen today. The demise of the creek came early on when the city set up its first municipal dump along the banks of the stream.

He later became a labourer and handyman for John Walter. Mathias, a dwarf, was a skilled archer and a strong swimmer.  His purpose-built house was across the road from the Walter home. The doors of Mathias’ house were only four feet high and the furniture was built in miniature to accommodate its owner’s small size. As reported in the original recommendation to the City Council for the naming of this park, Muchias’ “life was spent beside the river, and each day he brought several barrels of water on his stone-boat to the families living in the Fort Edmonton stockade….He was a powerful swimmer and was reputed for swimming the river when it was in full flood. In his spare time he watched the children play, and one day saved an Indian child from drowning.”  Mathias lived beside the North Saskatchewan River for more than 40 years. He died at the age of 86.

"North Saskatchewan River","Flowing 1,223 km from the Columbia Icefield to Hudson’s Bay; winding in a northeasterly direction through Edmonton.","River",,"The North Saskatchewan River, a tributary of the Saskatchewan River, takes its name from the Cree word, kis-is-ska-tche-wan, meaning “swift current.” It flows from the Saskatchewan Glacier in the Columbia Icefield, some 500 kilometres upstream from Edmonton, and has a total length of over 1,200 kilometres. The North Saskatchewan River meets the South Saskatchewan River about 50 kilometres east of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, to form the Saskatchewan River.The Blackfoot referred to it as the Omaka-ty, meaning “big river.” French maps dating from the 1790s give it the name Rivière Bourbon after the French royal family. Alexander Mackenzie noted the Saskatchiwine River in 1793. The North Saskatchewan River flows for 48 kilometres in a northeasterly direction through Edmonton and forms the river valley, the largest stretch of urban parkland in North America. The river valley includes 22 parks, 150 kilometres of trails and 14 ravines. Both the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company saw the potential of the river in expanding trade and built forts here in 1795. Using the river as a highway, Fort Edmonton soon became the centre of the western Canadian fur trade. Over the two centuries that followed, Edmonton grew to the northeast and southwest, following the course of the river valley. The North Saskatchewan River divided the two earliest communities – Edmonton and Strathcona – until completion of the Low Level Bridge in 1900. Where once the river provided a means to connect the city with outlying regions, it was increasingly seen as a barrier to trade and communication between the still separate towns lying on the northern and southern banks of the river. The two cities were amalgamated in 1912; a year later, the High Level Bridge was completed.","53.529773","-113.506966","(53.529773, -113.506966)"

Papaschase is translated from the Cree as “Big Woodpecker.” He was also known as Pahs-pahs-chase, Passpasstayo, and Passpasschase, while his English name was John Gladu-Smith. Chief Papaschase signed the adhesion to Treaty No. 6 in Edmonton in 1877, one year after the treaty was signed by the Plains and Wood Cree and the Assiniboine of the North-West Territories. According to the terms of the treaty, the band was to receive land, but several years passed before Papaschase Indian Reserve No. 136 was formed. It covered some 65 square kilometres comprising 42 sections of land. The reserve encompassed the area now defined by 30 Avenue and 51 Avenue on the south and north, and by 17 Street and 119 Street on the east and west. European settlers already resident in the general area opposed the creation of the reserve and the granting of land to members of the Papaschase band. When Treaty No. 6 was signed in 1876 there was no recognized definition of the term Métis. By 1886, however, the government had decided upon one and offered scrip to anyone with Métis ancestry. About 194 of the 200 people on the reserve accepted the scrip (either $240 or 240 acres of land); most of the Métis chose the cash certificate. With so few people remaining on the reserve, the government closed it and the band members scattered, some joining other reserves, including the Enoch band at Winterburn. In 1888 the Papaschase Indian Reserve was surrendered to the federal government and in 1891 the rich agricultural land was put up for sale at a public auction held in Calgary; most of the quarter-section lots sold went to speculators. A second auction was held in Edmonton in 1893, this time with conditions placed on the sales to encourage European settlers to purchase the land. The Papaschase Indian Reserve was the first reserve to be surrendered for immigration settlement.","53.485249","-113.474672","(53.485249, -113.474672)"

"St Albert Trail","111 Avenue at 128 Street to 117 Avenue at 131 Street, 118 Avenue at 133 Street to the City of St. Albert","Road",,"The St. Albert Trail is the main route between the city of Edmonton and the city of St. Albert, which abuts Edmonton’s northwest boundary. It forms part of the Queen Elizabeth II Highway (Highway 2) route between the US border at Carway in the south, and through Grande Prairie in northern Alberta west into British Columbia. The continuation of the St. Albert Trail in St. Albert is called Chemin St. Albert Trail Kihcitwâw Albert Meskanaw, which incorporates the French, English and Cree names for the community, and reflects the city’s Cree, Métis and francophone heritage. The earliest trail past the site of what later became St. Albert was one created in 1824 under order of George Simpson, governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), that connected Fort Edmonton to Fort Assiniboine 120 kilometres to the northwest. It was one of a network of trails branching out from Fort Edmonton. Commencing at the fort, just below where the Alberta legislature is today located, the trail to St. Albert followed the edge of the river valley through the area that later became the HBC Reserve at 121 Street. It continued northwesterly past the east side of Mistatim Lakes, located between the current 156 Street and 170 Street. Once past these lakes, two thirds of the 14-kilometre distance from the fort to the St. Albert Settlement had been covered. The importance of the trail northwest out of Edmonton increased after the establishment of the Roman Catholic mission in St. Albert in 1861 by Bishop Taché. He named the mission in honour of the patron saint of his travelling companion, Father Albert Lacombe. An earlier mission had been established at Lac Ste. Anne in 1843. However, it was located in an area that was not suitable for farming, and was too far from a major provisioning centre. St. Albert was a more suitable spot. It became the operational centre of the Oblate Missionaries’ work, first with the area’s Cree and Métis people and later with French-speaking Roman Catholic settlers. An HBC post operated in St. Albert from 1866 to 1875. With its thriving agricultural community, St. Albert became a village in 1899, a town in 1904 and a city in 1977. Today, the St. Albert Trail is one of Edmonton’s busiest thoroughfares.","53.576315","-113.553765","(53.576315, -113.553765)"
"Star Blanket Park","2614 39 Street","Park","1983","Chief Ahchacoosahcootakoopit “Star Blanket” (b. 1840) was a member of the File Hills Crees, who lived northeast of Fort Qu’Appelle in the District of Saskatchewan. Star Blanket fought many battles with the Blackfoot and the Sioux and eventually became a chief. He reluctantly signed Treaty No. 4 at Fort Qu’Appelle on September 15, 1874, but refused to be confined on a reserve. In an attempt to retain his freedom, he and his followers made their way west to the Cypress Hills where they continued to live a traditional lifestyle. After four years, however, the dwindling supply of buffalo forced Star Blanket to move on to the File Hills Reserve. To his dismay, reserve life provided little comfort and his people were still hungry. Although sympathetic with the Riel uprising, Chief Star Blanket was determined to honour the peace agreement. He confronted Major General Middleton at Duck Lake and was assured that no harm would come to his people if they remained on the reserve., Shortly after, however, a report to the contrary prompted Star Blanket and his band to set out for Fort Qu’Appelle, unaware that they were heading straight into the line of fire of Middleton’s Canadian militia troops. In order to avoid a slaughter, the North West Mounted Police were requested to intervene, at which time they arrested Star Blanket and jailed him at Regina. He was released two weeks later. The Star Blanket Park is in the Bisset neighbourhood and has an area of 2.13 hectares.","53.457892","-113.4009","(53.457892, -113.4009)"

Stony Plain Road likely gained its name because it connects Edmonton with the town of Stony Plain, 34 kilometres west of Edmonton. The precise origin of the name is not known. It likely derives from the Stoney people who lived in the area. The Stoney First Nation is culturally and linguistically related to the Plains Assiniboine and historically lived along the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The name may also have arisen from the abundance of boulders found in the area. In 1964, Stony Plain Road was extended from 121 Street and 104 Avenue on the east to 170 Street and 101 Avenue on the west.

Sunwapta Broadcasting Company was formed in 1934. It bought the radio station CFTP and changed the name to CFRN to reflect the owners’ (George Rice and Hans Neilson) surnames.

The highway is an amalgamation of many highways that originated as historic Aboriginal and fur trade routes. Before construction of the roads, the Canadian Northern Railway and the Grand Trunk Pacific forged their ways through the Yellowhead Pass between 1912 and 1914. In the late 1910s and early 1920s the Edmonton Area Good Roads Association became involved in the first concerted effort to build automobile roads to the Rocky Mountains and beyond, and encouraged development of what would become a key section of the Yellowhead Highway. In 1947 the inaugural conference of the Trans Canada Highway System (Yellowhead Route) took place. The Yellowhead Highway takes its name from Yellowhead Pass, the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide on the North American Continent. The mountain pass was used for centuries by Aboriginal people and was first mentioned in European accounts around 1826. It was for many years the route used by fur traders travelling to the New Caledonia Department (an area beyond the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia) of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). HBC documents used the name Tête-Jaune, or Yellowhead, for Pierre Hatsinaton, sometimes called Pierre Bostonais, who was a Métis guide and trapper who worked in the area of the pass now known as Yellowhead.","53.581411","-113.504326","(53.581411, -113.504326)"
