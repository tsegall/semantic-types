"Zoie Gardner Park","Violet ""Zoie"" Gardner (1918-1998) cared for hundreds of homeless children, largely at her own expense, and was a member
of the Order of Canada. Gardner was born in Manchester, England, and came to Canada with her parents when she was only a year old. The family homesteaded near Grande Prairie and later moved to Edmonton, where her father worked as a janitor
at the legislative buildings. Gardner was the eldest of 11 children and left school after completing Grade 8 to work.

By the mid-1960s, Gardner was said to have a heart bigger than the 13-room house she called home in the Calder area of
north Edmonton. It was here that she shared her life with handicapped and hard-to-place foster children. In the early
years, Gardner supported herself and the children who lived with her by working as a dressmaker. At one point there were
24 children under her roof. Some stayed for only a few days while others remained with her for more than 20 years; the
average stay was ten years.

For her contribution to Edmonton’s children, Gardner was honoured as the Outstanding Citizen of 1961 by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce. In 1966 the welfare department paid Gardner two dollars a day for each child under her care. While
the sum was a marked increase from the sixteen cents a day she had received 25 years earlier, she told local media that
she was struggling to make her monthly mortgage payments. In the late 1960s the Edmonton Rotary Club took over the
mortgage and by the 1970s Gardner had taken on a second house.

In 1971 she received a citation from the Edmonton Foster Parents’ Association recognizing her 30 years as a foster
parent. Gardner, who loved opera, was also a long-serving volunteer for the Edmonton Opera Society, providing snacks for
performers during rehearsals. The American singer Harry Belafonte was said to always ask for Gardner when he visited
Edmonton.

Gardner died at the age of 80 in July of 1998, just three months after receiving the Order of Canada. The Zoie Gardner

"Edmonton Grads Park","Dr. James Naismith (1861-1939), the Canadian-born inventor of basketball, said of the Edmonton Commercial Graduates
Basketball Club: “The Grads have the greatest team that ever stepped out ona basketball floor.” The players of the
legendary Grads were all alumnae of McDougall Commercial High School. In the 25-year career of the Grads, the team won
an unparalleled 502 of 522 games. These wins included 21 Western Canadian championships, and every Canadian championship
from 1922 to 1940. The Edmonton Grads disbanded in 1940, in part because the team’s gymnasium had been taken over by the
British Commonwealth Air Training Plan as part of the war effort.

On the international level, the team won so regularly that the international Underwood Trophy was given to them for
permanent possession in 1940. The Grads participated in four Olympic exhibition tournaments from 1924 to 1936, in Paris,
Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Berlin. The team won all 27 of its Olympic matches. Remarkably, only 38 women played with the
Grads throughout the team’s illustrious 25-year history. In addition to bringing Edmonton great fame and honour, the
Grads helped dispel the common belief that involvement in competitive sports was somehow dangerous or unhealthy for
young women.

The team’s coach was J. Percy Page (1887-1973), who came to McDougall Commercial High School as a teacher in 1912. Page
and his assistant, Bill Tate, devel- oped a farm system to hone the skills of promising basketball players. After the
Grads disbanded, Page ran successfully for the Alberta Legislative Assembly first as an Independent (1940, 1944), then
as a Conservative (1952, 1955). After being defeated in the 1959 election, Page was appointed lieutenant-governor of the
Province of Alberta, a post he held until 1966.

"Star Blanket Park","Chief Ahchacoosahcootakoopit ""Star Blanket""  (b. 1840) was a member of the file Hills Crees, who lived northeast of Fort Qu'Appelle in the District of Saskatchewan. Star Blanket fought many battles with the Blackfoot and the Sioux and eventually became a chief. He reluctantly signed Treaty No. 4 at Fort Qu'Appelle on September 15, 1874, but refused to be confined on a reserve. In an attempt to retain his freedom, he and his followers made their way west to the Cypress Hills where they continued to live a traditional lifestyle. After four years, however, the dwindling supply of buffalo forced Star Blanket and his people to move on to the file Hills Reserve. To his dismay, reserve life provided little comfort and his people were still hungry. Although sympathetic with the Riel uprising, Chief Star Blanket was determined to honour the peace agreement. He confronted Maj.-Gen. Middleton at Duck Lake and was assured that no harm would come to his people if they remained on the reserve. However, shortly after, a report to the contrary prompted Star Blanket and his band to set out for Fort Qu'Appelle, unaware that they were heading straight into the line of fire of Middleton's Canadian militia troops. In order to avoid a slaughter, the North West Mounted Police were requested to intervene, at which time they arrested Star Blanket and jailed him at Regina. He was released two weeks later. The Star Blanket Park is in the Bisset neighbourhood and has an area of 2.13 ha.","Park","1983",,"53.4575277","-113.4007625","POINT (-113.4007625 53.4575277)"

Hawrelak resigned in 1959 due to a provincial inquiry into land sales in which he was involved. The City sued Hawrelak for $266,000; he settled out of court, paying only $100,000 and his legal fees. The citizens re-elected him as mayor in 1963 but just two years later he was forced, once again, to resign after a Supreme Court of Alberta ruling on some of his real estate holdings and transactions. Hawrelak was a 40 per cent owner of SunAlta Builders Ltd., and the transaction to sell land to the City of Edmonton was completed while he was in office. The City sued Hawrelak in a civil suit for $80,117. The Supreme Court of Canada, however, upheld an appeal filed by the mayor in March 1975.

"Kiniski Gardens","Polish-born Julia Kiniski (1899-1969) was a colourful and determined Edmonton politician who was credited with breathing
new life into Edmonton civic politics. After ten failed attempts, Kiniski was elected as an alderwoman in October 1963.
She was only the third woman to win a seat on City Council. As president of the Civic Rights Protective Association,
Kiniski campaigned against wasteful city spending during the two-decade-long domination of municipal affairs by
politicians connected to the Civil Government Association.

Kiniski emigrated from Poland to Chipman, Alberta, with her family in 1912 and married at the age of 16. She left school
after completing Grade 7; as an adult, she attended extension courses in psychology and philosophy at the University of
Alberta. She and her husband moved to Edmonton in 1936.

Between 1945 and 1962, in the course of her ten unsuccessful runs for office, “Big Julie,’ as she was known, became an
accomplished, albeit unconventional, speaker. Her 1963 victory was said to have reinvigorated public interest in City
Council. While Kiniski’s outspoken criticism of city spending did not make her popular with civic administrators, her
defence of the “little people” captured the public’s imagination. A local radio personality, Jerry Forbes, recorded a
song about her set to the tune of “Hello Dolly.” By 1968, in her last election, Kiniski had so greatly increased her
share of the votes that she led all other candidates by a clear margin.

After her election in 1963 she was re-elected three times (1964, 1966, 1968) and served until her death from a heart
attack in 1969 at the age of 70. Kiniski was the mother of six children, including the professional wrestler Gene
Kiniski. During the late 1910s, the southern portion of Kiniski Gardens was known as Edmonton Market Gardens.","Neighbourhood","1976",,"53.4748427","-113.4017258","POINT (-113.4017258 53.4748427)"

"Walterdale Bridge","This bridge, completed in 1913, was originally named 105 Street Bridge. It was renamed in 1967 in honour of John Walter
(1850-1920), an Edmonton businessman and pioneer who strung the first ferry cable across the North Saskatchewan River at
Fort Edmonton, in the same area where the bridge is now located.

John Walter arrived in Fort Edmonton a penniless boat builder and went on to become one of the region’s most successful
entrepreneurs and the emerging city’s first millionaire. Born in the Scottish Orkney Islands, Walter came to Edmonton in
1870 to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), building York boats for traffic on the North Saskatchewan River.

Under the terms of his employment, Walter was under contract to the HBC for a five-year period. At the end of that term,
he left the HBC and went into business for himself. Walter settled on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River,
across from Fort Edmonton, in what became known as Walterdale. He was the first settler to own property on the south
bank. His simple log home would later house Edmonton’s first telegraph office.

Walter set up many ventures, including carpentry and boat building, a sawmill and lumberyard and a cable ferry called
The Belle of Edmonton, launched in 1882. Walter also built a sternwheeler, the City of Edmonton, launched in 1907, and a
side-wheeler, the City of Strathcona, which was later converted to a sternwheeler. His boat works constructed ferries
and steamers used throughout the northwest. His many businesses, as well as his land holdings, made Walter a wealthy
man; his worth at one time was estimated at $1 million.

Completion of the High Level Bridge in 1913, ending the need for regular ferry service across the river, had a dramatic
impact on Walter’s business. Two years later, in 1915, the North Saskatchewan River flooded and wiped out both of his
sawmills, leaving him in financial ruin. At its height, Walter’s sawmill operation cut 16 million board feet a year.

The name Walterdale has been in use since around 1907, was officially approved in 1969 and is no longer in use. At the
turn of the 2oth century the Walterdale district, bounded by 109 Street and the North Saskatchewan River, represented
the heart of the region’s industry. Hundreds of men were employed to work in the area’s coal mine, sash and door plant,
tannery and brickyard, as well as Walter’s two sawmills. Walterdale’s industries flourished until the flood of 1915. The
riverside plants destroyed by the rising waters were never rebuilt.","Bridge","1967",,"53.5243436","-113.5068696","POINT (-113.5068696 53.5243436)"

"Borden Park","Borden Park, named in honour of Sir Robert Laird Borden (1854-1937), the eighth prime minister of Canada, has been an
important Edmonton attraction for almost 100 years. In the early part of the last century, as many as 7,000 people would
pour into the park on a Sunday to enjoy picnics, baseball and music. Originally known as East End City Park, it was
established in 1906. The 21.99-ha. park was renamed following Prime Minister Borden’s visit to Edmonton in 1914. Borden
was elected prime minister in 1911 and held office until his retirement in 1920.

One of the city’s first three swimming pools was situated in Borden Park. As the Edmonton Journal noted in an article
published on September 20, 1924: “The whole pool radiates good humor and innocent enjoyment, and is a fitting reply to
those prudes who elevate their eyes to high heaven and deplore the ‘wickedness’ embodied in mixed bathing.” The East End
swimming pool, the article continued, “will go a long way towards building up a healthy, vigorous, graceful and
clean-minded womanhood.” In addition to the pool, the park was for many years home to the Edmonton Zoo. Among its first
animals was a bear cub named Louise. As well, there were two buffalo, two elk, monkeys, coyotes and peacocks. Other park
attractions were a tea room and rides, including a carousel, a giant roller coaster and a tunnel-of-love. The latter, in
a bow to decorum, was known as “the Old Mill.”

By the mid-1930s, however, the Old Mill had been destroyed by fire and the rides were showing their age. The massive
roller coaster, built in 1915 at a cost of $15,000, was dismantled in 1935 and its timbers salvaged by a lumber company.
Borden Park has continued to be an important outdoor venue for Edmontonians, though the attractions oftered have changed
somewhat since its establishment almost a century ago. In the late 1970s, the park’s bandshell hosted performances by
two of the city’s new-wave rock bands, The Silent Movies and Smarties.","Park","CU","Commemorative (Canadian Prime Minister)","53.5626946","-113.4556715","POINT (-113.4556715 53.5626946)"

He was later blamed for the Frog Lake Massacre of 1885. Despite his innocence, Big Bear surrendered at Fort Carleton and faced treason charges. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years at Stony Mountain Penitentiary. Big Bear served two years of his term before being released because of ill health.

The original owners of the land were George and Elizabeth Cresswell, who settled it  in 1905. They originally planned to subdivide their property. The crash of Edmonton's real estate market in 1913, however, bankrupted many land speculators and brought the city's remarkable pre-WWI growth to a halt. The city would not see a boom in the land market again until after WWII. Because of this, many of the neighbourhoods that had been subdivided and named in the first decade of the twentieth century remained farmland and were not developed until well after the 1950s. The Cresswell family continued to farm here until the 1970s, when the land was finally developed for residential use.

"Dr. Anne Anderson Park","Anne Anderson (1906-1997) pioneered the teaching of the Cree language in western Canada. A Métis elder once described
Anderson as “the heart of the [Métis] Nation.” In her long and active life, Anderson was a nurse, a teacher and the
author of more than 90 books on Métis history and culture and the Cree language. Apart from her language tapes, Anderson
was probably best known for her 'Cree Dictionary'. She also researched and documented traditional herbal remedies.

Anderson was one of ten children born to Elizabeth “Betsy” Callihou and William Joseph Gairdner on the river lot they
farmed east of St. Albert. Her parents were of Cree, French and Scottish descent. Anderson attended school to Grade 10
and then worked on the family farm. After marrying and having two children, she moved to Edmonton in the mid-1940s and
became a nurses’ aide.

After 15 years of nursing, Anderson began what was to be her most important work—the preservation of the Cree language.
Recalling the dying words of her convent-raised mother, Anderson set out to record and teach the Cree language. She
founded Cree Productions, which published Cree dictionaries and instructional materials. She also served on the Alberta
Cultural Heritage Council. She initiated Cree classes at schools and centres across Canada and lectured at the
University of Alberta, Grant MacEwan Community College, Fairview College, the Charles Camsell Hospital and Fort
Saskatchewan Correctional Facility.

Anderson received the Native Council of Canada Award, an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Alberta and
the Order of Canada. Among her many books were 'The First Métis...A New Nation', which documented the history of the
Métis in Alberta. Anderson died at the age of 91. The Dr. Anne Anderson Park is in the Britannia neighbourhood and has

"Yellowhead Trail","The Yellowhead Trail, which passes through Edmonton, is part of the nearly 3,200-kilometre-long Yellowhead Highway that
connects Winnipeg in the East to Massett on the Queen Charlotte Islands in the west. The highway is an amalgamation of
many highways that originated as historic Aboriginal and fur trade routes. Before construction of the roads, the
Canadian Northern Railway and the Grand Trunk Pacific forged their ways through the Yellowhead Pass between 1912 and
1914.

In the late 1910s and early 1920s the Edmonton Area Good Roads Association became involved in the first concerted effort
to build automobile roads to the Rocky Mountains and beyond, and encouraged development of what would become a key
section of the Yellowhead Highway. In 1947 the inaugural conference of the Trans Canada Highway System (Yellowhead
Route) took place.

The Yellowhead Highway takes its name from Yellowhead Pass, the lowest crossing of the Continental Divide on the North
American continent. The mountain pass was used for centuries by Aboriginal people and was first mentioned in European
accounts around 1826. It was for many years the route used by fur traders travelling to the New Caledonia Department (an
area beyond the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia) of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). HBC documents used the
name Tête-Jaune, or Yellowhead, for Pierre Hatsinaton, sometimes called Pierre Bostonais, who was a Métis guide and

"McCauley","Matthew McCauley (1850-1930), a pioneer liveryman and stagecoach operator, was the Town of Edmonton’s first mayor. He
was born in Ontario and came to Fort Saskatchewan in 1879. Two years later he moved to Edmonton where he established a
livery stable and butcher shop. McCauley organized Edmonton’s first public school in 1881 and was a founding member (and
served for 18 years) of Edmonton’s school board.

It was not until 1882 that a system of land titles and homestead grants was introduced in western Canada. Prior to this,in the absence of legal title, local residents led by McCauley protected their claims by force. McCauley was captain of what was known as “McCauley’s Vigilantes,” a group of local men who forcibly removed the property of newcomers who
attempted to squat on land cleared by the area’s first settlers. On at least two occasions, the shack of a claim-jumper who failed to heed warnings from the vigilantes was pushed over the banks of the North Saskatchewan River and the newcomer was driven out. In 1892, when the federal government sought to transfer the Land Titles Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, McCauley used his hastily gathered volunteers to stop the planned move.

When Edmonton was incorporated as a town in 1892, McCauley became mayor by acclamation and was re-elected in 1893 and
1894. In 1905, the year that Alberta became a province, he was elected to the first provincial legislature, representing
Vegreville. He resigned after only a year to become warden of Edmonton’s first federal prison, working there from 1906
to 1911. McCauley School (on McCauley Street, present-day 107A Avenue) was opened in this neighbourhood in 1912.
McCauley lived in British Columbia from 1912 to 1925 and then moved to Sexsmith, Alberta. McCauley, the father of 12
children, lived to the age of 80 and died on his farm is the Peace Country.","Neighbourhood","CU",,"53.5551041","-113.4839538","POINT (-113.4839538 53.5551041)"

"Hardisty","Richard Hardisty (1831-1889) was the chief factor of Fort Edmonton from 1872 to 1882. He was born at Fort Mistassini
near James Bay, in present-day Québec, and began working for the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) in 1849. Hardisty’s role as
chief factor made him one of Edmonton’s pioneer leaders. In 1874 he built the first house outside the walls of the fort,
and in 1888 was appointed Alberta’s first senator.

Hardisty came from a family of fur traders. His father and his grandfather had also worked for the HBC. He was educated
at the Red River Academy at Fort Garry, later known as St. John’s College, Winnipeg. Hardisty worked at Fort Garry,
Cumberland House, Fort Carlton, Fort Victoria (now known as Pakan), Rocky Mountain House and Fort Edmonton. In 1867
Hardisty married Eliza Victoria McDougall, eldest daughter of Rev. George McDougall, the first Protestant missionary to
live in the district.

By the late 1870s, the massive herds of buffalo that had once ranged across the prairies were dwindling rapidly. As
chief factor of Fort Edmonton, Hardisty dealt with the imminent disappearance of the buffalo and the very real threat of
hunger by establishing HBC cattle ranches. This decision was to bring great change to the region as settlers soon
arrived to take part in the increasingly land-based, rather than fur trading, opportunities. Hardisty was also
responsible for the building of lumber and flour mills.

In 1888, the same year he became a senator, the HBC promoted Hardisty to inspecting chief factor. He died the next year
in Winnipeg after breaking his neck in a road accident. The two-storey Hardisty home, known as the “Big House,” was
located at the present-day site of the Alberta Legislature.","Subdivision","1956",,"53.554829","-113.4339162","POINT (-113.4339162 53.554829)"

Pylypow was the eldest son of Hawrylo Pylypiwsky, a farmer. Pylypow and a friend, Wasy] Eleniak (1859-1956), made a
brief journey to the Fort Saskatchewan area in 1891, then returned to Ukraine to collect their families. Pylypow’s
reports of vast untilled land awaiting settlers in Canada sparked a rush for emigration by the impoverished residents of
his home area. Quoted by local media on the opportunities available to new immigrants, Pylypow was arrested by the
Ukrainian authorities and jailed for six months for promoting immigration to Canada.

He returned to Alberta with his family in 1893 and homesteaded in the Edna-Star district in east-central Alberta. Within
a decade of his arrival, more than 1,500 homesteads in Alberta had been settled by Ukrainian immigrants. By WWI, an

"Hudson's Bay Reserve","In 1870 the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) sold Rupert’s Land to the Dominion of Canada. For 200 years the company had been
absolute lords and proprietors of the vast territory. A deed of surrender, under which the HBC agreed to relinquish its
claim to Rupert’s Land, was negotiated between the government of Canada and the HBC in 1869. The terms of this agreement
allowed the HBC to retain parcels of land around each of its posts. These lands became known as Hudson’s Bay Reserves.
The HBC claimed 3000 acres (1,214 ha.) surrounding Fort Edmonton. The property was bounded by present-day 101 Street on
the east, 121 Street on the west, 118 Avenue on the north and the North Saskatchewan River to the south. In addition to
land, the HBC received £300,000, and title to one-twentieth of all farmland within the terri- tory, some 2.8 million ha.
of land in all.

The Hudson’s Bay Reserve was eventually sold to settlers, the first lots being put up for sale by the HBC as early as
1883. On May 13, 1912, the company sold the remainder of its substantial Edmonton properties by public lottery. Despite
attempts to keep the location secret, more than 2,000 people lined up for the sale; the HBC received $4.3 million from
the sale of some 1,500 lots. The excitement surrounding the release of the Hudson’s Bay Reserve lots marked the peak of

"MacDonald Drive","In the 1890s and early 1900s this road was called College Avenue. It was renamed McDonald Drive in 1914 and in 1921 the spelling was changed to MacDonald Drive. There are at least two possible origins for the name. MacDonald Drive (or McDonald Drive, as it was originally spelled) may have been named after James McDonald (d. 1908), a contractor and real estate agent who came to Edmonton in 1879. McDonald became wealthy from subdividing the Cromdale district. In 1890 he built a large home at 102 Street and 100 Avenue, on what is now MacDonald Drive (the home was condemned and demolished in 1960). McDonald lived in Edmonton until the early 1900s and then retired to Victoria. MacDonald Drive may also have been named after the Hotel MacDonald, which was named for Sir John A. MacDonald (1815-1891), the first prime minister of Canada (1867-1873, 1878-1891). Situated on 100 Avenue and 100 Street, the Hotel MacDonald was built between 1912 and 1916 by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. It features an exterior of Indiana limestone and sheet-copper roofing. One of the most elegant hotels in Edmonton, it was restored in 1991 and designated a Municipal Historic Resource by the City of Edmonton.","Road","CU",,"53.5395104","-113.492905","POINT (-113.492905 53.5395104)"

"Strathcona","Strathcona was named for Sir Donald Alexander Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal (1820-1914). He was born in
Forres, near Inverness in northern Scotland, and apprenticed with the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) in 1838. Fifty years
later, in 1889, Smith became governor of the company.

In the 1870s, Smith was a politician and railroad financier who promoted the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). In 1896 he
was appointed High Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom. Smith held this position, and the governorship of the
HBC, until his death. Smith can be seen in one of Canada’s most famous photographs: he is the white-haired, top-hatted
gentleman driving the last spike for the CPR at Craigellachie, BC, in 1885.

In 1891 a town site was established when the Calgary and Edmonton (C&E) Railway reached the south side of the North
Saskatchewan River. Rather than embark on the building of a bridge across the river, the C&E located its terminus on the
south side.

Its plan was to promote “South Edmonton” as the area's major commercial centre in competition with Edmonton, on the
north bank of the river. To this end, C&E purchased land for the establishment of a town site in the spring of 1891. By
the end of 1898, South Edmonton was renamed Strathcona (informally known as Scona).

The high hopes for Strathcona were never quite fulfilled, however, and by 1910 the CPR had undertaken to build the High
Level Bridge across the North Saskatchewan River. Strathcona became a town in 1899 and a city in 1907. The City of
Strathcona amalgamated with Edmonton in 1912.

The area now known as the Strathcona neighbourhood was originally part of River Lots 15 and 17. Whyte Avenue between 101
Street and 109 Street is Strathcona’s traditional commercial area, and has gone through a number of transformations over
the years. Through the efforts of the Old Strathcona Foundation and many others, much of the area’s original historical
character has survived.","Neighbourhood","1898",,"53.5220097","-113.4916344","POINT (-113.4916344 53.5220097)"

"Farnell Close","Edmonton-born Margaret “Peggy” O’Connor Farnell (1916-2004) was an agent for the British Secret Intelligence Service
(SIS) during WWI; from 1942 to 1945 she worked in Central America, South America and the Caribbean for the SIS. Farnell
attended the University of Alberta, where she majored in French and German, and Simmons College in Boston, where she
studied library science. In 1937 Farnell returned to Edmonton and began working as a reference librarian at the
Rutherford Library at the University of Alberta. The outbreak of war in Europe, however, soon brought dramatic changes
to her life.

With the help of a friend in Toronto, Farnell made contact with the British Secret Service in New York, and was soon
hired as a secret agent. She later said she had no idea she had applied for a job as a spy. Farnell was stationed at the
British Security Coordination headquarters in New York for one year, working for the head of western hemisphere
operations, Sir William Stephenson—the man called Intrepid. After a year in New York, she held one-year postings in
Port- au-Prince, Haiti, and Montevideo, Uruguay, where she worked for the SIS station chief. In Haiti, among her many
responsibilities, Farnell reported on German submarine activity and decoded cables.

After the war Farnell returned to Edmonton. She married WWII veteran Gordon Farnell and raised three sons. She also
resumed her position at Rutherford Library, where she worked from 1963 to 1981, when she retired as head of the
Humanities and Social Sciences Library. In 1982, with the expiry of a 35-year secrecy limit under Britain’s Official
Secrets Act, Farnell granted several interviews about her wartime work to local media. Farnell is the author of Old
Glenora, a history of the neighbourhood where she was born and lived for most of her life. Her parents were George Bligh
O’Connor, an Alberta Supreme Court Chief, and Margaret Farlie O’Connor, a journalist and theatre critic.","Road","1989",,"53.4668869","-113.5870475","POINT (-113.5870475 53.4668869)"

Louis Riel. She was born in Maskinongé, Canada (Quebec), and married the voyageur and fur trader Jean-Baptiste
Lagimodiére (1778-1855) in 1806. Shortly after their marriage they travelled together to the west, first settling with a
Métis community at Pembina (in present-day North Dakota) where their first child was born.

Marie-Anne and her husband arrived in Fort Edmonton in 1807 and remained there until 1811; she was the first
non-indigenous woman to live in Fort Edmonton. The family later returned to Manitoba, where they settled at the
confluence of the Red and Seine Rivers (present-day Winnipeg).

Marie-Anne and Jean-Baptiste had eight children, the sixth of whom, Julie (b. 1822), was the mother of Louis Riel
(1844-1885). Riel was the leader of the Red River Rebellion in 1869-1870 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885. He was
executed on November 16, 1885 after being found guilty of high treason. Today, Riel is celebrated as the father of

1900 Boxer Rebellion, an uprising that targeted Christian missionaries. The Ronnings went to Norway and then to the
United States. Deciding to return to China following the suppression of the unrest, the family travelled by train across
Canada to the west coast. A chance meeting with other Norwegians in Calgary led Halvor Ronning to purchase land in
Alberta. They continued to China but had created a tie to Canada. 

Following the death of Hannah Ronning in China, the
Ronning family came back to Canada in 1907, first to their farm at Bardo, near Tofield, and finally around 1913 to
Valhalla in the Peace River Country. Chester Ronning became a teacher and taught in Edmonton schools. Later, he studied
at the University of Minnesota. After serving in WWI, Chester Ronning went back to China to teach but returned to
Alberta in 1927, when he became principal of Camrose Lutheran College, a position he held for 15 years. Ronning also
served as a United Farmers of Alberta member of the Alberta legislature from 1932 to 1935. He was the leader of the
Alberta Co-operative Commonwealth Federation from 1938 to 1943. In 1942, he joined the war effort in Ottawa, where he

"Papaschase Industrial","Chief Papaschase (c. 1838-1918) was the leader of the Papaschase Indian Reserve, located in what is now southeast
Edmonton. Papaschase is translated from the Cree as “Big Woodpecker.” He was also known as Pahs-pahs-chase, Passpasstayo
and Passpasschase, while his English name was John Gladu-Smith.

Chief Papaschase signed the adhesion to Treaty No. 6 in Edmonton in 1877, one year after the treaty was signed by the
Plains and Wood Cree and the Assiniboine of the North-West Territories. According to the terms of the treaty, the band
was to receive land, but several years passed before Papaschase Indian Reserve No. 136 was formed. It covered some 65 square kilometres comprising 42 sections of land.

The reserve encompassed the area now defined by 30 Avenue and 51 Avenue on the south and north, and by 17 Street and 119
Street on the east and west. European settlers already resident in the general area opposed the creation of the reserve and the granting of land to members of the Papaschase band.

When Treaty No. 6 was signed in 1876 there was no recognized definition of the term Métis. By 1886, however, the
government had decided upon one and offered scrip to anyone with Métis ancestry. About 194 of the 200 people on the
reserve accepted the scrip (either $240 or 240 acres of land); most of the Métis chose the cash certificate. With so few
people remaining on the reserve, the government closed it and the band members scattered, some joining other reserves,
including the Enoch band at Winterburn.

In 1888 the Papaschase Indian Reserve was surrendered to the federal government and in 1891 the rich agricultural land
was put up for sale at a public auction held in Calgary; most of the quarter-section lots sold went to speculators. A
second auction was held in Edmonton in 1893, this time with conditions placed on the sales to encourage European
settlers to purchase the land. The Papaschase Indian Reserve was the first reserve to be surrendered for immigrant
settlement.","Neighbourhood","1961",,"53.4841823","-113.4808395","POINT (-113.4808395 53.4841823)"

"Youville Drive East","Youville Drive East and West form a semicircular roadway that encompasses the Grey Nuns Hospital, located north of the
Mill Woods Town Centre Mall. These “Grey Nuns”, so called because of the colour of their habits, are members of Les
Sceurs de la Charité de l’Hôpital Général de Montréal. The order was founded in 1738 by Marguerite d’Youville (1701-1771), sister of the explorer Lavérendrye. The mother of two children, she was widowed at the age of 29. She
dedicated the rest of her life to caring for the needy, the poor and the unwanted. Marguerite d’Youville was canonized
in 1990.

The first nuns to settle in the northwest reached their SUS destination, the Roman Catholic mission at Lac Ste. Anne, on
September 24, 1859. The three Grey Nuns —Sisters Emery, Lamy and Alphonse —left their motherhouse in Montréal a year
before, first stopping nine months in St. Boniface to acclimatize to the rigours of frontier life.

Writing in her journal that first day at Lac Ste. Anne, Sister Alphonse noted: “As we approached the goal where
henceforth, our days would be spent...our pleasure abated and serious reflections replaced it. However, our trust in God
soon dissipated the clouds which the future seemed to hold in store for us.""

In 1861, when the Oblate priests decided to move their mission for the Métis closer to the large centre of trade at Fort
Edmonton, the three sisters moved with them. Two years later, Father Lacombe’s residence became the site of the
settlement’s first school, with Sisters Emery, Lamy and Alphonse as the teachers. In 1864 the Youville Asylum was opened and served as both convent and school. The asylum was later used as an orphanage and as the first hospital in central
Alberta.

In 1894 Edmonton’s rapidly growing population caused Drs. Wilson, McInnes, Royal, Tofield, Harrison and Braithwaite to
petition Bishop Grandin to establish a hospital to be run by the Grey Nuns. The Grey Nuns purchased land from the

"Ottewell","Richard Phillip Ottewell (1848-1942) was an early pioneer who lived through the Riel rebellion and was one of the first
farmers to homestead in the Clover Bar area, in what is now eastern Edmonton. Ottewell emigrated from England to Ontario
with his family in 1850, when we was still a small child.

In 1869, Ottewell travelled to Fort Garry (now Winnipeg) as part of a federal work party and, arriving amid the Métis
rebellion, was imprisoned for six weeks by Louis Riel’s provisional government. One of the party, Ottewell’s cellmate
Thomas Scott, was tried and executed by Riel's forces. Upon their release from prison, in March 1870, Ottewell walked
for nine days in the dead of winter, the temperature falling as low as -40°C, to reach the safety of Fort Abercrombie in
the United States. Ottewell later returned to Ontario, where he married Frances Trevillion. In 1881, leaving his wife
and family behind, he set off for the west once more. Ottewell was one of the first to stake his claim and homestead in
what is today known as the Clover Bar area, then a distance of 16 kilometres east of Fort Edmonton. In 1883 his family,
which would eventually number nine children, joined him. During the North-West Rebellion of 1885, the Ottewells took
refuge in Fort Edmonton and Richard served in the home guard.

As Edmonton grew, the Ottewell farm shifted from grain to dairying. In 1904, Ottewell opened the Ottewell Coal Company
and later founded Campbell & Ottewell Flour Mills. Ottewell continued to live on his homestead until shortly before his
death at the age of 93 in 1942. The historic Ottewell farm, cut out of the bush in the 1880s, is today at the heart of
Edmonton’s heavy industrial area. Oil refineries and chemical plants now cover what was once considered among the best
farmland in the region.

During the 1910s, part of the Ottewell subdivision (90 Avenue to Whyte Avenue and 50 Street to 67 Street) was known as
East Glenora; to the north of this area, 90A Avenue to 95 Avenue was known as East Edmonton Park.","Neighbourhood","1957",,"53.5303382","-113.4307923","POINT (-113.4307923 53.5303382)"

"Boyle Street","Boyle Street, the former street designation for 103A Avenue, is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Edmonton. The rectangular blocks and straight streets of Boyle Street neighbourhood have existed since 1892 and conform to the original Edmonton Settlement, which was subdivided on the basis of river lots. The Hudson Bay Reserve, located north of Fort Edmonton, forced the emerging town of Edmonton to spread eastward and away from the fort. Consequently, Edmonton's early commercial district was located along Jasper Avenue and 97 Street (Namayo Avenue) near what is now the Boyle Street neighbourhood. It is likely that Boyle Street was named after an early resident of Edmonton, John R. Boyle (1870-1936). Born in Ontario, Boyle moved west to Regina in 1894 and studied law with McKenzie and Brown. Two years later, Boyle came to Edmonton where he worked at the office of Hedley C. Taylor (later Judge Taylor). After being called to the bar in 1899, Boyle entered into partnership with Taylor. Between 1904 and 1906, Boyle served with K.A. McLeod, Thomas Bellamy, W.H. Clark, J.H. Picard, D.R. Fraser, W.A. Griesbach and, later, Robert Mays and D.G. Latta on the first Municipal Council of Edmonton. Roadways off Boyle Street carried the names of some of these same men-Bellamy, Clark, Picard and Griesbach. Boyle was elected to the provincial legislature in 1905, re-elected in 1909 and remained undefeated until his retirement from provincial politics in 1926. In 1912 he was appointed King's Counsel and minister of education.

The judges awarded the prize of $50 in gold to a 19-year-old law clerk, S. Loughlin, who suggested the name ""The Highlands,"" which is descriptive of its position on the banks above the North Saskatchewan River. In 1910 William J. Magrath and Bidwell Holgate advertised the area as Edmonton's newest ""high class"" neighbourhood. Its selling features included the healthful, beautiful setting, large lots, and a $2500 minimum cost per house to ensure the standard of building would be high. So enthused were they about the area, they bought out J.A. McDougall's interest in the land in 1913. Messrs Holgate and Magrath also built houses next to each other on Ada Boulevard in 1912-1913.

vehicles, including those that were horse-drawn, to keep to the right. A portion of Jasper Avenue was paved in 1910. In

The first streetcar was driven across the bridge in 1908. The bridge was actually named somewhat later for its proximity to the High Level Bridge, constructed between 1910 and 1913. By the 1940s, it was apparent that the city's growing volume of traffic was too much for the single-laned bridge. City engineer A.W. Haddow suggested the bridge be twinned, and a new bridge, based on the original plans but with a wider bridge deck, was built next to the existing Low Level Bridge in 1949.

"Henderson Estate","Thomas Henderson (1837 or 1838-1926) was a pioneer who homesteaded in the Riverbend area in the 1800s. After living in Ontario and British Columbia, Henderson and his family came to the Edmonton area in 1880. The family farmed on several homesteads before finally settling near Rabbit Hill. In 1888, while travelling in eastern Canada, Henderson shipped Italian bees to his farm. These bees are said to have been the first swarm of honeybees in Edmonton. After seeing similar structures in Ontario and Florida, Henderson built a round barn in 1898. This barn is one of the few remaining round barns and can be seen at Fort Edmonton Park. This neighbourhood bears Henderson's name because his homestead was located nearby, 1.6 km west of Whitemud Creek on 23 Avenue in the Rabbit Hill area.","Neighbourhood","1979",,"53.4682684","-113.5984263","POINT (-113.5984263 53.4682684)"
"Calder","This Calder neighbourhood park has an area of 1.73 ha. The early development of Calder is linked to
the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway
(GT&P), which arrived in Edmonton in 1909. After
connecting the railway to Edmonton, the GT&P
located its roundhouse and railway yards in the area.

In July 1910, the village of West Edmonton was
established. Many GT&P employees settled there and
the village became known as a railway colony. In 1913
the City of Edmonton annexed the land surrounding
the village of West Edmonton and a few years later, in
1917, annexed West Edmonton itself.

The Calder Land Company, a real-estate firm
owned by Hugh Alfred Calder and J.R. McIntosh,
began to subdivide the area around 1910. The land was
originally settled by the McRoberts family. Hugh
Alfred Calder (1872-1964) arrived in Strathcona in
1902 and became a partner in the Calder Land
Company in 1907. He went on to serve as a city
alderman, first for Strathcona and then Edmonton
after amalgamation, from 1908 to 1916. After serving
in WWI, Major Calder returned to the Edmonton area
and took up farming.

Although some of Calder’s houses were pre-1910,
most were built after WWII. Generally, newer struc-
tures are located in the northern portion of the
neighbourhood while older structures are located in
the vicinity of the Calder Railway Yards. The present day Calder neighbourhood includes the former village
of West Edmonton (west of 120 Street) and Elm Park
(east of 120 Street). The Elm Park subdivision was
established around 1907 and became part of the city of Edmonton in 1913.","Neighbourhood","1910","Commemorative (local land development company)","53.5887658","-113.5287789","POINT (-113.5287789 53.5887658)"

"McKernan","The McKernan neighbourhood is part of the original land owned by Robert McKernan (1846-1908). He was born in Ontario and

line from Red River to Hay Lakes. James had earlier served with the North West Mounted Police, as only the third man to
enlist, before returning to Ontario and encouraging his brother to move west.

Robert and James took work with Dominion Telegraph and helped complete the line between Hay Lakes and Edmonton. They
also were given the contract, in 1877, to maintain the telegraph line west of Battleford. In 1878 Robert settled south
of the North Saskatchewan River, with his wife Sara. A large, two-storey farmhouse was built. It stood on the site of
the present-day McKernan Elementary-Junior High School until the late 1940s, when it was demolished. Sara McKernan bore
11 children in the home, all but one of whom lived to adulthood.

In 1896 Robert McKernan left farming and became involved in real estate development. In 1903, McKernan built the
Dominion Hotel; his son John went on to build the landmark Princess Theatre on Whyte Avenue in 1915. Complications from
appendicitis claimed the life of Robert at the age of 62; Sara lived until the age of 91.

The lake lying just east of the McKernan property was known as McKernan Lake. Before the lake was drained in the 1940s,

"Anthony Henday Drive","Anthony Henday, an English-born fur trader with the Hudson’s Bay Company, is believed to have been the first person of
European descent to make contact with Aboriginal people in today’s southern Alberta. Henday, with a party of Cree
guides, travelled west from York Factory by canoe and foot in 1754-55, reaching the prairies in the fall of 1754. In the
spring of 1755 he camped along the North Saskatchewan River, where he met with people from the Cree and Blackfoot
nations. Whether or not he was also the first to see the majestic, snow-capped Rocky Mountains, however, remains a
matter of dispute. While four copies of Henday’s original journal exist, they are contradic- tory and the identification
of quoted place names with contemporary geography has proven problematic.

Employed as a labourer for the Hudson’s Bay Company at York Factory, in what is now Manitoba, Henday volunteered to
travel west as part of the company’s program of expanding its contact with Aboriginal trading partners. Just southeast
of present-day Red Deer, Henday met with the chief of the “Archithinue” people (believed to be the Blackfoot). He
failed, however, to convince the chief of the benefits of trading with the Hudson’s Bay Company and returned to York
Factory. A second trip west, in 1759, was also unsuccessful. Henday left the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1762 and is
believed to have returned to England.

Anthony Henday Drive forms a portion of a staged, long-term roadway plan that has been part of Edmonton’s and Alberta’s
transportation network for more than 30 years. It is also an important link in the provincial north-south trade

Archer performed with the Montreal Women's Orchestra and as a church organist until she began music studies in New York; from 1947 to 1962 she studied and taught in the United States. Among the artists she studied with were the French composer Claude Champagne at McGill University, the celebrated Hungarian composer Bela Bartok and, while at Yale University, the German composer and theorist Paul Hindemith. From 1962 until her retirement in 1978, Archer taught theory and composition at the University of Alberta. 

Archer composed some 400 pieces for orchestra, chamber orchestra, piano, organ and voice.

Edson and served as mayor, town councillor and school
board member.

One of four children born to Hyman and Bessie
Goldstick, “Tiger” served with the Royal Canadian

He went on to have a successful career as a trainer
for the Edmonton Eskimos, the Eskimos Baseball Club

Den,” a featured segment on CFRN-TV’s popular chil-

"North Saskatchewan River","The Norrth Saskatchewan River, a tributary of the Saskatchewan River, takes its name from the Cree word, kis-is-ska-tche-wan, meaning “swift current.” It flows from the Saskatchewan Glacier in the Columbia Icefield, some 500
km upstream from Edmonton, and has a total length of over 1,200 km. The North Saskatchewan River meets the South
Saskatchewan River about 50 km east of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, to form the Saskatchewan River.

The Blackfoot referred to it as the Omaka-ty, meaning “big river.” French maps dating from the 1790s give it the name
Riviére Bourbon after the French royal family. Alexander Mackenzie noted the Saskatchiwine River in 1793.

The North Saskatchewan River flows for 48 km in a northeasterly direction through Edmonton and forms the river valley, the largest stretch of urban parkland in North America. The river valley includes 22 parks, 150 km of trails and 14
ravines.

Both the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company saw the potential of the river in expanding trade and sited
forts here in 1795. Using the river as a highway, Fort Edmonton soon became the centre of the western Canadian fur
trade. Over the two centuries that followed, Edmonton grew to the northeast and southwest, following the course of the
river valley.

The North Saskatchewan River divided the two earliest communities, Edmonton and Strathcona,  until completion of the Low Level Bridge in 1900. Where once the river provided a means to connect the city with outlying regions, it was
increasingly seen as a barrier to trade and communication between the still separate towns lying on the northern and
southern banks of the North Saskatchewan. The two cities were amalgamated in 1912; a year later, the High Level Bridge

Osborne's participation in the 1892 scuffle over the government's decision to move the Land and Timber Office from the north side of the North Saskatchewan River to the south side (South Edmonton/Strathcona) cost him his position. As the land agent was attempting to leave Edmonton with the office documents, prominent citizens, including Osborne and Mayor Matt McCauley, surrounded the land agent's wagon. The agent was told that he could leave town but the contents of the office must stay. In the ensuing confrontation, amid threats of bloodshed, the North West Mounted Police intervened and restored order. In the end, the citizens of Edmonton were victorious and the office stayed in Edmonton. Osborne, however, was forced to resign because of his involvement in the protest. He then established a gold prospecting operation along the North Saskatchewan River.","Road","1989",,"53.4647821","-113.561615","POINT (-113.561615 53.4647821)"

"Henrietta Louise Edwards Park","Henrietta Louise (Muir) Edwards (1849-1931) was one of Canada's most important feminists and the legal advisor for the
""Famous Five"". In 1927, at the age of 78, Edwards joined Nellie McClung, Emily Murphy, Irene Parlby, and Louise McKinney
in a petition demanding that Canadian women be granted the status of ""persons"" under the British North American Act,
therefore making them eligible to hold a seat in the Senate. 

On March 14, 1928, the Supreme Court of Canada met to consider the question put to it by the five Alberta women: “Does
the word ‘person’ in Section 24 of The British North American Act include female persons?” Five weeks later, the Court
gave its ruling: “No, it does not.” With the support of then Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the Famous Five appealed the
ruling to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, then the highest court of appeal. On October 18, 1929,
the five-member Privy Council ruled unanimously in favour of the petition, declaring women to be “persons” and clearing
the way for women to hold all public offices.

Edwards was responsible for much of the backroom work required for the “Persons Case,” preparing legal opinions,
carrying out research and writing letters. She was already a recognized authority on the law, having written two
handbooks on legal matters affecting women, Legal Status of Women in Canada (1917) and Legal Status of Women in Alberta
(1925).

Edwards was born and raised in Montreal. As a young woman, she established the Working Girls’ Association in downtown
Montreal, a forerunner to the Young Women’s Christian Association. She also published Canada’s first women’s magazine,
Women’s Work in Canada. In addition, Edwards helped found the National Council of Women in 1893 and the Victorian Order
of Nurses in 1897. She served as provincial president of the Council of Women and later was the chair of the National
Council of Laws.

Edwards and her husband, Dr. Oliver Cromwell Edwards, moved to Fort Macleod, in Southern Alberta, in 1903. Dr. Edwards
was posted there as a medical officer to the Blood Indian Reserve, west of Lethbridge. Together, they had three
children.

"Edmonton","Edmonton is one of the oldest areas of “European” settlement in what is now the province of Alberta. Fort Edmonton was
established in 1795 as a fur trade post of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). It was built as part of the HBC’s western
expansion during its competition for trade and influence with the rival firm, the North West Company (NWC). Fort
Edmonton was named for the English birthplace of Sir James Winter Lake. He was present at the meeting of the governors
of the HBC when it was decided to establish a fort on the North Saskatchewan River.

The first Fort Edmonton was built some 32 kilometres further down the North Saskatchewan from the current city, across
the river from present-day Fort Saskatchewan. For mutual protection, it was built in close proximity to the NWC’s post,
Fort Augustus, constructed earlier that same year. For a number of reasons, including the lack of readily available
firewood and threats by local Aboriginal groups, both companies abandoned this site in 1801, and moved to what is now
Rossdale, in downtown Edmonton. They stayed at this site for nine years and then, in 1810, moved to a spot at the
confluence of the North Saskatchewan River and White Earth Creek, about 15 kilometres east of the town of Smoky Lake,
northeast of present-day Edmonton. A number of forts, including NWC’s Fort Augustus, and the HBC’s Fort Edmonton were
relocated to this site. The forts shared the same stockade and were known as the Lower Terre Blanche Houses.

Another move occurred in the winter of 1813-1814, when this location was abandoned in favour of the site where the
Rossdale Power House now is situated. The third Forts Edmonton and Augustus became Fort Edmonton after 1821, when the
two companies merged under the HBC banner. Following a flood in 1825, Chief Factor John Rowand decided to rebuild
further above the flats. In 1830, the fortified trading post was located just below the present-day Province of
Alberta’s Legislature Buildings in Edmonton. The last buildings of this fort were demolished in 1915.

With the influx of settlers in the late 1800s, and its historical significance as a “gateway to the north,” Edmonton
prospered. In 1892 it was officially made a town and in October 1904 it was given the status of a city. Because of its
geographically central location and its political influence and connections, in 1906 Edmonton became the capital of the
newly created province of Alberta.

The name “Edmonton” is derived from the Anglo- Saxon Christian name Eadhelm and “tun” or “ton,” which means a “field” or
“enclosure.”","City","1795",,"53.5384453","-113.4950498","POINT (-113.4950498 53.5384453)"

"Dunvegan Road","Dunvegan Road is located in an area that has been part of the city since the early 1900s, when it known as Dunvegan
Yards.The railway yard and depot of the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia (ED & BC) Railway were built here,
making Edmonton the southern terminus of the railway. Dunvegan, in the peace Peace Country, was a major point along the
line to British Columbia. Between 1915 and 1926 Dunvegan Yards even had a school - Dunvegan Yards School - for the
children of the employees of ED & BC Railway.

Dunvegan Yards played an important part as a staging point in the settlement of the Peace River District and Northern
Alberta. It was also the focal point for supplies and men coming from all over North America during the construction of
the Alaska Highway during WWII. In 1981 the Canadian National Railway (CNR) bought the land from the Northern Alberta
Railway Company (NAR). Three years later, Dunvegan became the area’s official name. Subsequently, Dunvegan became part
of the Athlone neighbourhood, and today Dunvegan Road is a reminder of the community’s long association with the
railway.

The name of Dunvegan was taken from a castle in Northern Scotland. Located on the Isle of Skye, the castle is the
ancestral home of the McLeod family and the oldest inhabited castle in the region. Archibald Norman McLeod of the
fur-trading North West Company is believied to have brought the name with him when he established Fort Dunvegan on the
Peace River in 1805.","Road","1994",,"53.5883135","-113.5574096","POINT (-113.5574096 53.5883135)"
