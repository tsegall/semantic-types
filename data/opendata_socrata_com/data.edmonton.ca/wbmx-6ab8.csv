Latitude: 53.54221
Longitude: -113.57468

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2ass-zz48","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2ass-zz48.json","2018-08-30T18:07:04.000","2022-09-07T19:07:42.000","2022-09-07T19:36:50.000","data.edmonton.ca","218","197","1888820","Internal","public","Row ID","row_id","text","1"

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2ass-zz48","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2ass-zz48.json","2018-08-30T18:07:04.000","2022-09-07T19:07:42.000","2022-09-07T19:36:50.000","data.edmonton.ca","218","197","1888820","Internal","public","Location Description","location_description","text","3"

Development permits approve the use of a site, as well as the size and location of any buildings or structures. It is written approval from the City that development plans meet the Edmonton Zoning Bylaw regulations. An approved development permit is required before application for a building permit to construct the building or structure, or to apply for a business licence.

Some permits are combination permits. They combine both a development permit and a building permit in one application. This data set only represents the outcome of the development permit application. Building permit data is available through the General Building Permits dataset.

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2chj-8n5t","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2chj-8n5t.json","2018-09-02T17:16:16.000","2022-09-07T19:44:12.000","2022-09-07T19:44:23.000","data.edmonton.ca","222","202","1639000","Internal","public","Row ID","row_id","text","1"

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.

Latitude: 53.499861
Longitude: -113.626292

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2fzn-9ise","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2fzn-9ise.json","2019-01-04T19:03:07.000","2022-09-07T19:55:56.000","2022-09-07T19:56:06.000","data.edmonton.ca","194","172","1278390","Internal","public","Row ID","row_id","text","1"

- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2fzn-9ise","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2fzn-9ise.json","2019-01-04T19:03:07.000","2022-09-07T19:55:56.000","2022-09-07T19:56:06.000","data.edmonton.ca","194","172","1278390","Internal","public","Log Timestamp","log_timestamp","calendar_date","9"

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)

Latitude: 53.524859
Longitude: -113.587422

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2ja2-p998","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2ja2-p998.json","2018-12-07T16:52:41.000","2022-09-07T19:49:58.000","2022-09-07T19:50:09.000","data.edmonton.ca","210","172","1307960","Internal","public","Row ID","row_id","text","1"

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2kc6-nr8e","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2kc6-nr8e.json","2018-09-02T18:26:49.000","2022-09-07T19:45:16.000","2022-09-07T19:45:29.000","data.edmonton.ca","208","193","1643780","Internal","public","Row ID","row_id","text","1"

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2kc6-nr8e","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2kc6-nr8e.json","2018-09-02T18:26:49.000","2022-09-07T19:45:16.000","2022-09-07T19:45:29.000","data.edmonton.ca","208","193","1643780","Internal","public","Vehicle Count at Slowest Speed Detected","vehicle_count_at_slowest_speed_detected","number","16"

Latitude: 53.56044
Longitude: -113.49359

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
DFS devices are programmable with different parameters that can also follow a timed schedule.","dataset","driver feedback sign,speed data collection,speeding","https://data.edmonton.ca/d/2mha-kfg6","https://data.edmonton.ca/resource/2mha-kfg6.json","2018-08-30T00:47:24.000","2022-09-07T19:05:28.000","2022-09-07T19:34:26.000","data.edmonton.ca","236","191","1913900","Internal","public","Row ID","row_id","text","1"

The City has a number of Driver Feedback Signs (DFS) installed around the city. These units collect data as traffic approaches them and in some cases may display a message or a speed that is being detected. Also, these units are radar based and can only track one vehicle at a time (strongest signal).

Due to the number of DFS installations combined with the volume of data collected, each DFS has its own dataset.

Details of how the data is collected by the DFS are as follows:
- Data is accumulated and reported in 15 minute intervals
- Vehicle speeds are captured/reported in speed intervals (bins)
- Speed range/interval for the bins are determined by parameters/settings set for the DFS (Minimum/Maximum Speed Detection Setting)
- Two speed values are recorded for every vehicle - a Highest Speed Detected and a Slowest Speed Detected (explaining why there are two vehicle counts)
- The bins go from Bin 1 to Bin 10. Bin 1 can also be referred to a LO BIN and Bin 10 can also be referred to as HIGH BIN.

Things to note:

DFS devices are not to be used as or confused with traffic counters, as they are not.
DFS devices have a minimum detectable speed of approximately 6 km/hr.
DFS devices have a maximum (theoretical) detectable speed of approximately 225 km/hr.
