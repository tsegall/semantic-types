The City of Edmonton is a member of the United Nations Women Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces program, which works toward solutions to improve safety and decrease sexual violence for women and girls in public spaces. 

The Edmonton: Safe City project has launched a web-based mapping tool called SafeCityYEG that allows Edmontonians to report where they feel unsafe or safe in their communities and why. By pinning locations on a map and identifying a safety concern or places where you feel comfortable, you are helping to influence change.

The primary goal of this project is to gain substantial user participation from Edmontonians and those visiting the city — with a strong focus on women and girls — for a duration of up to one year. Depending on the results and feedback, this project may continue after the one-year mark.

The SafeCityYEG tool will be tracked based on the participation levels and feedback from users. Once the analytics are reviewed, the interdepartmental committee of Edmonton: Safe City, community partners and experts will use the data collected to ignite action. This may include working to change practices, policies, programs and initiatives within the City of Edmonton and other community organizations.

Data will be updated one month following the end of a yearly quarter. 

An ""incident"" is the set of connected events which usually constitute an occurrence report. Measuring by incidents is based on the Uniform Crime Reporting 2 (UCR2) survey standard developed by Statistics Canada so that all Canadian police jurisdictions have a comparable set of crime data. 

The crime types used here are for EPS's 4 Property Crime and 4 Violent Crime Indicators only. Hence, not every type of property crime nor violent crime incident is shown here. Additionally, this excludes criminal incidents that fall under Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. The criminal code that is used here is based on the most serious violation of the incident. For example, if a break & enter occurred that involved an aggravated assault, only the aggravated assault would be counted. 

It's important to note that incident-level data is a distinct measure for crime and will not match exactly with other EPS-reported statistics. There are two notable cases of this. The first is with EPS' Crime Map(http://crimemapping.edmontonpolice.ca/) which uses ""occurrence"" data. Occurrence data is more timely and immediately available, with incident-data based on occurrence data but with further revisions following UCR2 reporting rules. Secondly, EPS reporting on city-wide 4 Violent Crime Indicators is based on the number of victimizations, and since a violent criminal incident can have multiple victims, the figures reported in that manner will be higher.

The figures here do not count the roadside suspensions that occur as part of an impaired driving arrest. The type of Roadside suspensions in this measure arise from: 

1. AZAT (Alberta Zero Alcohol Tolerance Program) – Issued to GDL drivers with a BAC above zero. 30 day suspension, 7 day vehicle seizure.
2. IRS (Immediate Roadside Sanction) – BAC of .05 to .08 - 72 Hr suspension, 3 day vehicle seizure, with longer durations for subsequent offences.
3. 24 Hr Suspension – No reasonable Suspicion or Grounds to proceed in a formal Impaired Investigation, but a 24 hr suspension is given on the grounds of public safety.

Government policy related to domestic violence has progressed a great deal over the years (see the Alberta Justice Domestic Violence Handbook, 2014). Notable advancements include the establishment of the Office For the Prevention of Domestic Violence in Alberta in 1984, Alberta Justice' introduction of Prosecutor Guidelines in 2008 and Police Guidelines in 2009 (and updated in 2013), as well as several more recent Alberta legislative Acts that serve to protect victims against domestic violence.

Response Time Performance measures the percentage of the time that EPS dispatches a priority call and gets patrol on-scene to the event in the targeted time. The targeted time varies by priority level. Time here does not include the time it takes before the call is made available to the dispatcher. EPS's long-standing target is to meet the targeted time for 80% of events. 

The calculation for Response Time Performance is based on a subset of Dispatch Call Volume; it excludes impaired driving calls (i.e., non-fixed location calls), on-view calls (patrol observes the event before the public calls it in), and follow-up calls. Hence, quarterly Response Time Performance cannot be converted to annual figures based on the data provided here.

Priority 1 through 5 calls are categorized as follows:

◦Priority 1: In Progress Person At Risk - a rapid response will likely prevent or reduce further harm to a person. E.g., assault with a weapon in progress. Target: 7 minutes or less.

◦Priority 2: In Progress Property At Risk - Immediate response will likely prevent or reduce the further loss of property. E.g., a citizen observing a theft of auto in progress. Target: 12 minutes or less.

◦Priority 3: Just Occurred - Immediate response will increase the likelihood of locating a suspect. E.g., a mischief that occurred very recently. Target: 17 minutes or less.

◦Priority 4: The Nature of the Occurrence is Time Sensitive. E.g., a shoplifter is in-custody with security and is cooperative. Target: 40 minutes or less.

◦Priority 5: General Service - The nature of the offence is not time sensitive. E.g., a business finds that they were vandalized the night before (i.e., the absence of in progress or just occurred). Target: 180 minutes or less.","685",,"eps,edmonton police service,police,police statistics,police response time,police response time performance,police response,dispatch call volume,call volume,police performance,police calls","99",,"published",,,,,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/3hzu-tepj.json",,,

Proactive patrol work can be thought of as a policing investment that prevents or suppresses future criminality, or helps maintain public safety. Examples include patrolling a drinking establishment near closing time, searching out an individual with outstanding criminal warrants, or check in with a domestic-violence offender to ensure they are complying with their court ordered conditions.","205",,"eps,edmonton police service,police,police statistics,proactive time,proactive,proactive patrol time,police performance","80",,"published",,,,,"https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/resource/75h8-as7j.json",,,

This tool has been available to the public since the second quarter of 2013 to report less serious crimes online without having to file a report at a police station. Online reporting is a more efficient and streamlined reporting process, thus allowing EPS to redeploy its support resources to other organizational needs. The convenience of online reporting may encourage citizens to report crime that would otherwise go unreported; thus providing EPS with better intelligence about patterns of crime, which can improve police deployment to crime hot-spots.

Online Crime reporting is available for the following police matters:
◦Lost Property
◦Mischief
◦Theft from Vehicle (under $5,000)
◦Theft of Bicycle (under $5,000)
◦Theft under $5,000

-the number of EPS occurrence reports that could have been reported online, but were reported by other means (e.g,. reporting at a police station)

- Understand the drivers of the performance measures and provide recommendations about how the measures can be further improved.
