PSUs were classified as ""urban"" if they were located in one of the 60 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States. Otherwise, they were classified as non-urban. Overall, 282 PSUs were assigned to the urban stratum, and 2,822 were assigned to the non-urban stratum.

PSUs larger than the sampling interval were allowed to be selected multiple times, thus directly increasing the number of districts that could be selected from that PSU. A total of 480 PSUs were selected with probability proportional to the measure size.  District Selection: All public and private schools that served K-12 in the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii were included in the sampling frame. Districts with less than 10 students per grade were excluded. Independent private schools were grouped together for sampling purposes to form a district or were assigned to public school districts in their location. Eligible districts had to have at least one middle/junior high school and one senior high school.  School Selection: Within the sampled districts, all public, private, Catholic, vocational, and special education schools were included. Only middle/junior high and senior high schools were eligible to participate. The middle/junior high schools were sampled independently of the senior high schools.  Classroom Teacher Selection: Sampling frames for each of the three classroom teacher samples were constructed for each school. The teachers were listed by group and by course or department.

Each practice sends information to the data coordinating center located at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, which consolidates this information into a single uniform database.

To ensure that the identities of patients and practices remain confidential, HIVnet does not contain any information that can identify individual patients or providers. For the same reason, information on the geographic region of the country is not available. HIVnet enables users to examine resource utilization for specific demographic and clinical subgroups. To preserve confidentiality, however, HIVnet reports only one subgroup breakdown at a time; users cannot obtain resource utilization statistics for combinations of factors (such as a combination of gender, race, and age).

The study was developed by the American Institutes for Research, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute, and several other organizations, including the University of Pittsburgh, through a Cooperative Agreement.

It is the only large scale, nationally representative study that tracks participants from childhood to retirement age. This enables researchers to study how experiences, abilities, interests, and personality types demonstrated early in life impact the health and wellbeing of individuals as they age. Researchers hope to discover patterns that indicate why some people continue to thrive mentally, physically, and financially throughout their lives, while others are challenged in these areas. Information gained from this type of study can provide crucial insights into the causes, preventions, and remedies for some of the most critical issues facing current and future generations of Americans.    In the area of cognitive health, for example, many researchers and resources have been dedicated to unraveling the mystery of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s affects over 5 million people and their families across the United States. Recent studies have suggested, however, that a significant portion of the population may be living with a condition known as Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s. While their brains show the physical evidence of Alzheimer’s disease, they suffer no outward symptoms. Researchers believe that the key to discovering why the disease affects people differently, allowing some to thrive while others are severely debilitated, lies in the early life experiences, interests, and personality types of the subjects. Findings from research such as this can inform important public policy, educational curricula, and social services to help current and future generations live healthier, happier, and more productive lives.    Finally, the lives of the Project Talent generation span a period of remarkable transformation in the history of this country, from the Civil Rights Act, desegregation, the rise of women’s liberation, and the Vietnam War to the coming of the internet age.

Prior healthcare workforce models generally have assumed that all physician specialties provide a uniform set of services completely different from the set of services of another specialty. This model, however, reflects the real-world nature of clinical practice, in which physicians in different specialties have overlapping scopes of services. The FutureDocs Forecasting Tool represents the first implementation of the ""plasticity"" methodology that recognizes this overlap.

For this reason, it is useful to calculate incidence separately for ethnic and racial groups within the registry's area of coverage. Of primary concern when calculating ethnic- and race-specific rates is the comparability of definitions between the numerator (i.e., cancer cases) and the denominator (i.e., population estimates). Specifically, the methods that are used to define a person's race or ethnicity in the numerator of the rate should be comparable to those used in the denominator. Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to obtain appropriate estimates of the size of the population by ethnicity and race.

The surveillance system is funded through the Infant  Health Initiative. The overall goal of PRAMS is to provide a basis for improved policies and programs  that reduce infant mortality and morbidity by changing women's high-risk behaviors during the  periconception and perinatal periods. Using PRAMS findings, States will be better equipped to  determine how to allocate resources and target subpopulations at increased risk of poor birth  outcome. PRAMS is being implemented in collaboration with 13 States and the District of Columbia.     PRAMS is an ongoing state-specific population-based surveillance of selected maternal behaviors that  occur before and during pregnancy and the child's early infancy. States collect data from a sample of  state resident women who have recently had a live birth. State sampling plans are tailored to meet the  individual needs of the State. Average annual sample sizes range from 1,200 to 3,600 women per  State. Samples are stratified to obtain larger numbers of high-risk deliveries.     Women are asked about their prepregnant and prenatal behaviors, their experiences of complications  during pregnancy, and their use of health care during pregnancy and the first months of the infant's  life. Questionnaire data are linked to information available from infant birth certificates.     The data may be used to assess trends in behavioral risk factors, to identify gaps in health care to be  targeted for intervention, and to assess the impact of behavioral risk factors and health care problems  on pregnancy outcome, including birthweight and infant mortality. PRAMS questions are designed to  permit States to track relevant Year 2000 Health Objectives for the Nation and provide information  needed for Federal grant programs, e.g., the Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) block grant and  the Title X Family Planning grant.","Child (birth-17)","American Indian;  Chinese;  Japanese;  Hawaiian;  Other Asian or Pacific Islander;  Black;  Other Nonwhite;  White;  Unknown.",,,,,,,,"Compendium of Publicly Available Datasets and Other Data-Related Resources.

Using these data, WFRS creates reports for data managers indicating whether the system provided ""optimally fluoridated"" water for the month (the definition of which depends upon the State-set optimal range for water fluoridation).  This helps fluoridation managers identify opportunities for improving the quality of water fluoridation and reward systems performing well.

In 2013, approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths occurred in the United States. TBI is a contributing factor in a third of all injury-related US deaths. An estimated 3.2 to 5.3 million people live with the long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological health disabilities of TBI, with annual direct and indirect costs estimated at over $76 billion. Although researchers are gaining ground in our understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI, these advances have failed to translate into a single successful clinical trial or treatment.



The NINDS-funded, multicenter Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study aims to change this. In collaboration with expert public-private partners, researchers are collecting and analyzing detailed clinical data on subjects at 18 U.S. sites, across the injury spectrum, along with CT/MRI imaging, blood biospecimens, and detailed clinical outcomes. TRACK-TBI has currently enrolled over 2,700 TBI patients on the path to reach its enrollment goal of 3,000 by the end of the study. This rich and diverse precision medicine dataset will reside in a publicly accessible infrastructure of integrated databases, imaging repositories, and biosample repositories – a true TBI Information Commons.

The data use a corrected form of the zip-code-to-CBSA crosswalk to assign providers to CBSA based on the zip code reported on their submitted claims.  This correction resulted in a small percentage of providers that exist in both version 2.2 and version 2.3 with different values for their CBSA code and type variable.



In 2017, PECOS introduced a new hospitalist specialty designation. To accommodate this change, version 2.3 changes the definition of hospitalists to include any provider who self-identifies as such in the PECOS data as well as primary care physicians who had at least 90% of their line items in an inpatient hospital setting. 

The data source for the part B non-institutional claims data changed the method by which it identifies final action claims.  This modification can change the content of the claims data, e.g. procedure codes and allowed-charges dollar amounts.

Expenditure estimates for 1960-2004 are currently available in data files or in published articles.  Projections are based on the National Health Expenditures and are estimates of spending for health care in the U.S. over the next decade. Projections are presented by type of service delivered (hospital care, physician services, nursing home care, etc.) and by source of funding for those services (private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket spending, etc.).  Age Estimates    Personal health care (PHC) estimates by type of service and source of funding are broken out in seven age groups: 0-18, 19-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over. These estimates can also be seen in three main age groups: Children (ages 0-18), Working-age Adults (ages 19-64), and Elderly (ages 65 and over). Simulation of personal health care spending in future years with all variables other than population distribution held constant to 1999 levels.      State Health Expenditures    Estimates of health care spending for 1980-2004 by type of establishment delivering care (hospitals, physicians and clinics, nursing homes, etc.) and for medical products (prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and sundries and for durable medical products such as eyeglasses and hearing aids) purchased in retail outlets. These estimates are useful in measuring health spending's role in a State's economy. These estimates should not be used to calculate estimates of spending per person in a state (see State of residence estimates)  Sponsors:  Business, Household and Government Health Care Spending    Estimates of health care spending by sponsor: Businesses, Households and Governments.  These estimates provide context for discussion of who ultimately pays for health care, the underlying pressures and the burden that affect these sponsors and their decisions  to finance health care in the United States.

Prevention and Treatment (16 indicators): includes measures of receiving preventive care and the quality of care in ambulatory, hospital, and long-term care and postacute settings.  Potentially Avoidable Hospital Use and Cost (nine indicators, with one indicator, hospital admissions for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions, reported separately for two distinct age groups): includes indicators of hospital use that might have been reduced with timely and effective care and follow-up care, as well as estimates of per-person spending among Medicare beneficiaries and the cost of employer-sponsored insurance.  Healthy Lives (11 indicators): includes indicators that measure premature death and health risk behaviors.  In addition, the Equity dimension includes differences in performance associated with patients’ income level (nine indicators) or race or ethnicity (10 indicators) that span the four other dimensions of performance.    The following principles guided the development of the Scorecard:    Performance Metrics. The 42 performance metrics selected for this report span the health care system, representing important dimensions of care. Where possible, indicators align with those used in previous state scorecards.    Data Sources. Indicators draw from publicly available data sources, including government-sponsored surveys, registries, publicly reported quality indicators, vital statistics, mortality data, and administrative databases. The most current data available were used in this report. Appendix B provides detail on the data sources and time frames.    Scoring and Ranking Methodology. The scoring method follows previous state scorecards. States are first ranked from best to worst on each of the 42 performance indicators. We averaged rankings for indicators within each dimension to determine a state’s dimension rank and then averaged dimension rankings to determine overall ranking.

Most Americans use the services of physicians whose practices are nearby. Physicians, in turn, are usually affiliated with hospitals that are near their practices. As a result, when patients are admitted to hospitals, the admission generally takes place within a relatively short distance of where the patient lives. This is true across the United States. Although the distances from homes to hospitals vary with geography - people who live in rural areas travel farther than those who live in cities - in general most patients are admitted to a hospital close to where they live which provides an appropriate level of care.    The Medicare program maintains exhaustive records of hospitalizations, which makes it possible to define the patterns of use of hospital care. When Medicare enrollees are admitted to hospitals, the program's records identify both the patients' places of residence (by ZIP Code) and the hospitals where the admissions took place (by unique numerical identifiers). These files provide a reliable basis for determining the geographic pattern of health care use, because research shows that the migration patterns of patients in the Medicare program are similar to those for younger patients.    Medicare records of hospitalizations were used to define 3,436 geographically distinct hospital service areas in the United States. In each hospital service area, most of the care received by Medicare patients is provided in hospitals within the area. Based on the patterns of care for major cardiovascular surgery and neurosurgery, hospital service areas were aggregated into 306 hospital referral regions; this Atlas reports on patterns of care in these hospital referral regions.",,,,,,,,,"Sheps Center, UNC-CH",,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/1465"

Findings demonstrate that health insurance is a critical lever to open the door to health care services for low-income adults. Uninsured low-income adults often experience health problems, but are more likely than those with insurance to forgo care or go into debt to pay for health care. The scope of coverage matters for insured low-income adults and some, particularly those with health problems, have difficulty shouldering out-of-pocket health care costs.",,,,,,,,,"Health Services Accessibility ||  Insurance Coverage ||  Medically Uninsured ||  Risk Factors ||  Socioeconomic Factors ||  Time Factors",,"This 2005 national survey was a random digit dial survey of adults ages 19 to 64 living in families with incomes at or below twice the poverty level, with a national all-income comparison sample. The low-income survey sampled the low-income population in the highest poverty Census tracks that account for 20% of the low-income population. There were 5,482 low-income completed interviews and the low-income survey yielded a response rate of 31%. We also fielded a follow up non-response study, which produced a response rate of 49%. The estimates in this paper are all derived from the low-income sample. Respondents' health insurance is based on their coverage at a point in time and some respondents' coverage status might have changed in the year before they were surveyed. All differences that are discussed in the paper are statistically significant (p<0.05), except where noted.The survey weights for the low-income survey take into account the selection probability and non-response and are post-stratified to align the data to U.S. Census 2000 data using the following variables: geography, race/ethnicity, education, sex and age.

What they needed was an ""access tool"" that could be used by a novice in computing and would allow them to use computer-based data to learn about their City.  They could then learn how to analyze urban data without struggling to acquire and convert data from main frame computers.    By 1990, Infoshare was being used in the Department of Urban Studies at Queens College and at the CUNY Medical School, where pre-med students learned how to perform community health assessments.    Soon we found that many others needed access to community data, and we created Community Studies of New York, Inc., as a service to other non-profit organizations struggling to meet the needs of their service areas.  Within a few years, community health centers, non-profit housing groups, family practice residency programs, and even government agencies were using Infoshare to understand their city. Smaller grassroots organizations were using our consulting services to assess needs in their communities. Rita Manning, the Associate Director of Community Studies of New York, has used Infoshare to assist community-based organizations throughout the City in meeting their data needs.

The authors also developed Strength of Tobacco Control Index (SOTC) to evaluate the ASSIST program. SOTC summarizes the multiple components of tobacco control efforts and provides information on which components of ASSIST or ASSIST-like programs might be related to lower smoking prevalence or cigarette consumption.

This goal was accomplished primarily through interventions in four policy areas: 1) promoting smoke-free environments, 2) countering tobacco advertising and promotion, 3) limiting youths' tobacco access and availability, and 4) increasing tobacco prices by raising excise taxes. The statewide tobacco control plans were carried out in the 17 ASSIST states by a network of state and local coalitions charged with developing and implementing interventions.    The ASSIST states implemented the project in two phases: a two-year planning phase (October 1991 through October 1993) and a six-year implementation phase (November 1993 through September 1999).    The ASSIST evaluation compared changes in tobacco control policies, state per capita cigarette consumption, and adult smoking prevalence in the 17 ASSIST states with those in the 33 non-ASSIST states and the District of Columbia.

The BCSC is a national registry that combines data from mammography registries in New Hampshire, Vermont, New Mexico, California, Washington, and North Carolina to form a national database.

Through CMDS, practices share data with CMR, and, in turn, CMR provides practices with access to and assistance with reports necessary for meeting MQSA requirements.    When data are received by CMR the information is processed through an automated Quality Control System.  This system validates the data for inconsistencies with a descriptive message and a display of the actual data.

Persons in the 5 percent sample who also appear in the SEER data are removed, leaving a sample of non-cancer cases. Medicare claims are available for the non-cancer cases in the same format as for the cancer cases. Information from the non-cancer group can be used for comparative purposes, such as the cost of care or the use of specific tests or procedures among a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries who do not have cancer. Data for the non-cancer cases can also be used with the data for the cancer cases to conduct population-based analyses of testing, treatment, and costs within the SEER areas.    For the cancer cases, investigators may link individual patients across files using the unique SEER case ID number. The SEER case ID number consists of an 8-digit case number and a 2-digit registry ID which when combined, uniquely identify each individual in the data.

Therefore, the SEER-Medicare data are not public use data files. Investigators are required to obtain approval in order to obtain the data. The purpose of the approval process is not to critique the methodology or merits of proposed projects, but to ensure the confidentiality of the patients and providers in SEER areas. NCI will work with investigators requesting data files to balance their research needs with those of the individuals and institutions included in the data. Please note that investigators may not request the entire data set.    For reasons of confidentiality, selected variables are not routinely released on the SEER-Medicare files.

The results from the first survey were widely used by academics and policymakers. Towards the end of the 1990s, it became increasingly clear that the NATSAL I results were growing outdated and that repeat measures were needed not only to provide up-to-date information for estimating the likely extent of the HIV epidemic in Britain, but also to look at behaviour change over time and to include new questions to take account of current information needs in the field of sexual health.    The main objectives of NATSAL II were to:  provide a detailed understanding of patterns of sexual behaviour in Britain (including for example, numbers of sexual partners, frequency of different sexual practices, and homosexual experience)  provide data for HIV/AIDS projections in Britain  assess whether there have been changes in behaviour since NATSAL I  measure the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection, via urine samples  Given the importance of making comparisons with NATSAL I data, NATSAL II was largely a repeat of the 1990 survey. However, it was also recognised that a number of methodological developments in survey research in the intervening period could lead to improvements in the data collection process for NATSAL II.

These injuries have a tremendous impact on our society in terms of morbidity,  cost of medical care, and long-term disability.     CDC began promoting the development of a multistate traumatic brain injury surveillance system  in 1989, after the Federal Interagency Head Injury Task Force Report identified the need for  better information on the public health impact of brain injuries. The surveillance system's  purpose is to collect program wide information that can be used to help design targeted  prevention programs addressing specific causes of TBI and populations at higher risk, to  improve injured persons' access to health care, and to improve other services they need after  injury.     In 1995, CDC published Guidelines for Surveillance of Central Nervous System Injury2 to help  ensure that the multistate TBI surveillance system would generate valid and timely information  representative of the U.S. population. These guidelines provided standard case definitions and  clearly defined the data elements necessary to describe the occurrence, severity, and outcome  of these injuries, their external causes, and associated risk factors. The core of these data  elements are obtained from hospital discharge reports that are available to most state health  departments.     In 1997, CDC published initial findings from this multistate TBI surveillance system, including  data from four jurisdictions: Colorado, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Utah.     As a result of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-166), CDC was able to add 11  states to the system in September 1997, bringing the total number of participants to 15.  Participating states now include Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Louisiana,  Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina,  and Utah. Together, these states represent much of the diversity of populations found  throughout the United States.",,"American Indian/Alaskan Native;  Asian or Pacific Islander;  Black;  White;  and Other.","Hispanic;  Not of Hispanic Origin.","Male",,,,,,,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/1613"

These have included: graded exercise treadmill testing; echocardiography, particularly for measurement of left ventricular mass; cardiovascular reactivity; serum cotinine; Lp(a), apoE phenotype, apolipoprotein A1 and B; homocysteine; skin reflectance; body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry; glucose tolerance testing; vascular resistance and compliance; and plasma renin activity and sympathetic nervous system activity.",,,,,,,"The original objectives of CARDIA were to document levels of risk factors for coronary artery disease and potential determinants of these risk factors in young adults; to study the interrelationships of risk factors and lifestyles and to document behavioral and environmental changes during the transition from adolescence to middle age; to compare cross-sectional and longitudinal data on age-related trends in cardiovascular disease risk factors; and to compare levels and evolution of risk factors between men and women, blacks and whites, and in groups of differing socioeconomic status. Goals of the study have evolved to emphasize understanding determinants of left ventricular mass, emerging obesity and hypertension, and sequelae of hypertension in pregnancy.

Secondary goals were to obtain information about language use and ethnic disparities, support systems, discrimination and assimilation, in order to examine whether and how closely various mental health disorders are linked to social and cultural issues. To this end, CPES joins together three nationally representative surveys: the NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION (NCS-R), the NATIONAL SURVEY OF AMERICAN LIFE (NSAL), and the NATIONAL LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDY (NLAAS). These surveys collectively provide the first national data with sufficient power to investigate cultural and ethnic influences on mental disorders.

Older individuals have differing levels and mixes of such resources and consume them at varying rates as they age.  A decline in health, including compromises in cognitive abilities, would be expected to increase the consumption of resources. The trajectories of these resources will vary across time, even for individuals with the same initial endowments. Changes in economic behaviors and dependencies on various programs and helpers have important implications for the rate, timing, and sequencing of subsequent changes in health.  Despite a number of recent studies of late life transitions, none provide detailed coverage of the joint dynamics among health (physical, cognitive, and functional), dementia, economic and family resources, and care arrangements.  The AHEAD study is intended to fill this gap in survey data on the oldest old.","Occassional","AHEAD Wave 1 (1993), AHEAD Wave 2 (1995), 1998","Initial sample of 7,447 respondents aged 70+ (and their spouses, if married, regardless of age) taken from the HRS household screening; supplemental sample of respondents aged 80+ from Medicare Master Enrollment File (HCFA)","Oversamples of Blacks, Hispanics, and Florida residents","United States","Individuals","Baseline: in-home, face-to-face in 1993, including spouses, if married, regardless of age.

The study collects data from a random, stratified sample of the 70 years and older persons living in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, South Australia.  The entire population of older persons living in Adelaide is represented, since both community and institutional dwelling residents are included.      Extensive analyses utilizing the longitudinal data will continue, and have been carried out in both Australia and the United States.

This database provided name, gender, date of birth, postal and residential address. The sample was stratified by gender and the age groups 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85 and over.  Both community- and institutional-dwelling individuals were included in the list of specified persons.  An additional component was that spouses aged 65 and over of specified persons also were invited to participate, as were other household members aged 70 years and over.    The initial baseline data collection for ALSO began in September 1992 and was completed in March 1993.  Components of this wave included a comprehensive personal interview, conducted via Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI), a home-based assessment of physiological functions, self-completed questionnaires, and additional clinical studies.  The average time of interview was approximately 2.5 hours.  Personal interviews were carried out at this first wave for 2.087 participants, including 566 couples (that is, persons 70 years of age and over and their spouse, if 65 and over).  Clinical assessments were obtained for 1,620 of the participants.    After an interval of one year from the initial interview, respondents were re-contacted by telephone.  These interviews lasted an average of 15 minutes, and included questions regarding changes in domicile, current health and functional status, new morbid conditions, changes in medication, major life events, general life satisfaction, and changes in economic circumstances. In Wave 2, 1,779 participants were re-interviewed.    The third wave of the study began in September 1994.  This phase was a complete re-assessment, with face-to-face interviews, clinical assessments, self-completed questionnaires, and other clinical and laboratory studies again carried out. CAPI was used in administration of the personal interview, which made it possible to pre-load selected prior information, thereby avoiding repetition of information divulged by the respondent at Wave 1.  A separate, shorter, proxy instrument was developed and used in this third wave, which proved very successful in maintaining a high participation rate.  A total of 1,679 interviews were carried out at Wave 3, and 1,423 clinical assessments were conducted.   Data collection for the fourth wave began in November 1995 and was completed by the end of February 1996.  Wave 4 is a short telephone interview similar to Wave 2. 1,504 interviews were completed.  A fifth wave of interviews was conducted during February 1998 resulting in 1171 completed interviews.    In addition to the primary data collection from respondents, ancillary data collection has been ongoing since the initiation of the study.  Data have been collected from secondary providers, including Domiciliary Care and Rehabilitation Services, Meals on Wheels, and the Royal District Nursing Society.  Lists of ALSA participants are compared biannually with the agencies' lists to determine the prevalence and incidence of receipt of services from these organizations.   Another source of information has been the collection of data from the participants' General Practitioners.

Despite the trend toward an older population, little empirical data has been collected to clarify how the old are faring and how their social and economic status will change as the population ages.  Indeed, most sources of demographic information on developing countries exclude old people from the population to maximize efficiency for the primary task of estimating recent fertility and infant mortality rates.  Also, most information on the economic status of households comes from labor force surveys and household budget surveys, which often exclude older people.    There have been some notable surveys examining aging populations in Asian countries, e.g., surveys by the University of Michigan, Population Studies Center; the World Health Organization; the United Nations University, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

These changes affect us as individuals and as a country. Examples include:  mismatches between physical or cognitive status and job demands; the increased flexibility of work schedules; changes in the structure of private pensions away from defined benefit plans; the availability and cost of retiree health insurance; the increased importance of intergenerational transfers of both money and time; the recent pattern of labor force participation of women, blacks, and Hispanics; changes in longevity and in health status during old age; and workplace accommodation to disability.

The Health and Retirement Study is intended to provide data for researchers, policy analysts, and program planners who are making major policy decisions that affect retirement, health insurance, saving and economic well-being. In 1990, the National Institute on Aging awarded F. Thomas Juster of the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research a five-year cooperative agreement to plan and undertake a study that would contain the most promising source of data on retirement for the foreseeable future. The planning process included an unprecedented amount of interdisciplinary input from experts across the country. Throughout the design process, nine planning committees met to discuss the most important issues that could be addressed in this longitudinal study. Many of those committees continue to influence study design and quality. Study Directorship was transferred to Robert J. Willis of the University of Michigan in 1996. The fourth wave of data collection (HRS 1998) was completed in March of 1999, and the study is now at the end of its second 5-year funding cycle. A proposal for renewal funding to collect three more waves of data has been submitted to NIA for review. Future data collections  will largely replicate HRS 1998 in design, format, coverage, structure and measurement.

The intent of this effort is twofold: to promote a better understanding of the aging process in disparate societies, and to afford researchers and policymakers in the U.S. a better opportunity to gain insights and formulate responses to demands generated by an aging American population.",,,,,,,,,,,"The International Data Base on Aging (IDBA) is a subset of a larger International Data Base (IDB) that is maintained and updated by the IPC.  The IDB contains the IPC's population projections for all countries of the world, as well as information for as many as 51 demographic and socioeconomic variables for each country.  The initial IDB design included virtually no statistics for elderly age groups; as was common until recent years, the elderly typically were aggregated into a broad open-ended age group (e.g., 60 or 65 years old and over).  The primary goal of the IDBA is to expand the age coverage of the IDB by assembling census, survey, administrative, and population-projection data for 5-year age groups up to the oldest available grouping.    The detailed IDBA statistics include not only numbers of people in each age cohort, but also their marital statuses, labor force participation and occupation, mortality rates, and related characteristics.  For certain industrialized countries, income comparisons of the aged and non-aged, and among the aged, are being included, as information from ongoing studies becomes available.  Another goal of the IDBA is to broaden the temporal coverage of statistics on the elderly; data for 1950 to the present are included, with population projections running through the year 2050.  Information about cohorts over time allows researchers to go beyond mere cross-sectional comparisons to analyses of the same age cohorts in different countries.    Data base contents have been reviewed for internal consistency and international comparability.  Source documentation accompanies all information, and additional notation of conceptual definitions and/or data irregularities is provided where necessary.

The objective is to describe the physical and mental health of the study group and link them to key social variables (e.g., social support, health behavior, acculturation, migration).",,,,,,,,,,,"The Hispanic EPESE was funded in 1992 as part of a special initiative of the National Institute of Aging.  There was a recognition at that time that while important epidemiologic data on elderly Non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans had become available through the EPESE studies begun in the 1980's in East Boston, New Haven, North Carolina, and rural Iowa, comparable data were not available for Hispanic elderly.  A study focusing on the Mexican American population of the Southwestern United States has been proposed.      The main impetus behind the application was that basic information on the health of Mexican American elderly was simply not available.  Much of the existing knowledge in the area was based on data from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) conducted during 1982-4.  The HHANES covered Mexican Americans in the Southwest, Cuban Americans in Dade County, Florida, and Puerto-Ricans in the greater New York City area.  Unfortunately, the study was limited to persons under 75 years of age and the number of the elderly in this study was too small to provide stable estimates of their health status.  In addition, the HHANES did not include instruments measuring the physical functioning of subjects.  Other available knowledge in the area was also limited in that it had been based on a number of small, regional studies.     In addition to providing basic data on the population¿s health and health care needs, a guiding principle behind the Hispanic EPESE was that the socioeconomic and health characteristics of Mexican Americans, including the elderly, were different from those of non-Hispanic white Americans, African Americans, and other major ethnic groups (Cotton, 1990).  Knowledge on whether certain risk factors for mortality and morbidity operate differently in Mexican Americans was not available.  For example, it was not clear whether obesity, physical exercise, social support and other variables had the same influence on health outcomes in Mexican Americans as in other groups.    With this background in mind, the Hispanic EPESE was launched during 1993-4 when the baseline data were collected.  To the extent possible, the study was modeled after the existing EPESE studies, especially the Duke EPESE, which included a large sample of African Americans (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990).  Unlike the other EPESE studies that were restricted to small geographic areas, the Hispanic EPESE aimed at obtaining a representative sample of community-dwelling Mexican American elderly residing in the five Southwestern states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and California.  Approximately 85% of Mexican American elderly reside in these states and data was obtained that are generalizable to roughly 500,000 older people (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1990).  The final sample size of 3,050 subjects at baseline is comparable to those of the other EPESE studies and is sufficiently large to provide stable estimates of most health characteristics of interest.    With this background in mind, the Hispanic EPESE was launched during 1993-4 when the baseline data were collected.  To the extent possible, the study was modeled after the existing EPESE studies, especially the Duke EPESE, which included a large sample of African Americans (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990).","Senior (66+)",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/1934"

An A-design PSU consists of a county or a group of contiguous counties.  All counties in the entire US are grouped into 376 A-design strata.  Of these strata, 156 consist of only one PSU (self-representing PSUs); the rest are formed from counties with similar total 1970 population, percent of population with race as non-white, number of farms, and per capital retail sales.  For the NLTCS the A-design strata are collapsed to form 173 LTC strata, of which 39 consist of only one PSU (self-representing PSUs); these are automatically included in the LTC sample.  The remaining 134 LTC strata are formed by combining A-design strata with similar characteristics.  The combining of A-design strata into LTC strata is based on the proportion of the population 65 years or older and enrolled in Medicare as estimated for the A-design sample PSU in each A-design stratum.  In each of these 134 LTC strata (nonself-representing PSUs), one A-design stratum is selected with probability proportional to its estimated 1978 Medicare population.  The A-design sample PSU from that stratum is then selected as an LTC sample PSU.  The sample for the 1982 NLTCS was randomly drawn from Medicare administrative files.   A two-stage procedure identified chronically disabled persons for household interviews. In the first stage, all 35,008 persons were screened. This identified 6,393 persons in 1982 with at least one chronic impairment in seven Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) or nine Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Since residence was confirmed in the screen process, 1,992 institutional residents were separated from the 26,623 nondisabled community residents (of the 35,008 total) who reported no ADL or IADL impairments. Interviews were completed with 6,083 (95.2 percent) individuals. No institutional interviews were conducted in 1982.  The 1984 NLTCS has a complete longitudinal design with an institutional component.

The Terman Gifted Children Study (later renamed the Terman Life Cycle Study) began in 1921-22 when most of the 1528 participants were in elementary school.  Major efforts have been made to follow up on and improve the dataset.  Data have been collected/refined on the subjects' social relations, education, personality, habits, careers, families, mental health, life stress, physical activities, physical health, date of death and cause of death through 1990.  Until the project began, the study aimed primarily to describe the life course of gifted individuals. That is, the study was originally focused on addressing such issues as whether bright children were neurotic, introverted, sickly eggheads.  (It turned out that they were not).  As young adults, they were generally healthy and successful.  In middle age, they were largely productive citizens, but with none clearly identifiable as a ""genius.""  In short, the focus of previous studies (by others) had been on social and career success.  Few predictive studies using the data had been undertaken, with little or no study of health as a function of individual differences.  Especially noteworthy is that death certificates (through 1990) have been collected from state agencies, and coded cause of death using a certified nosologist supervised by medical expert, Dr. Criqui, who has expertise in coding death certificates.      Terman's aim was to secure a reasonably random sample of bright California children, and so most public schools in the San Francisco and LA areas in the1920's were searched for bright children, nominated by their teachers and tested by Terman.  The sample was later characterized as a productive, intelligent segment of 20th century middle-class American men and women. The average birth date was 1910, with a S.D. of 4 years.

To date, it is the most widely used IQ test, and that is in part due to the ability of the test to measure cognitive aptitude in a less verbal environment. In its infancy, the test was supposed to aid in the testing of people who did not speak English natively, which made it hard for them to understand what certain IQ tests were asking of them. This made for an uneven distribution of scores, where those who had a hard time understanding the test were incorrectly labelled as less intelligent. While the test does have a section dedicated to measuring the verbal capacities of a test taker, it was the first test formally designed to assess non-verbal performance.",,,,,,,,,"Intellectual Ability ||  Intelligence Tests ||

By using a wide variety of variables to track and measure, the Wechsler test offers a very comprehensive analysis of one’s cognitive performance abilities, and allows for a more storied analysis of where their core strengths and weaknesses are. Lastly, the test allows for the measurement of two main categories of IQ, Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), and General Ability Index (GAI), where FSIQ is a measurement of performance across all subcategories, but the GAI is more resistant to issues that might arise from cognitive impairment, allowing for a more precise and truthful analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/1307"

For this reason, the study can provide early indications of trends and problems that will become important as the larger group passes through its fifties. This adds to the value of the study in obtaining basic information about the life course as such, independent of the cohort's vanguard position with respect to the baby boom. In addition, the WLS is also the first of the large, longitudinal studies of American adolescents, and it thus provides the first large-scale opportunity to study the life course from late adolescence through the mid-50s in the context of a complete record of ability, aspiration, and achievement.",,,,,,,,,"Public Health Systems",,"The WLS is a long-term study of a random sample of 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957 and of their randomly selected brothers and sisters. Survey data were collected from the original respondents or their parents in 1957, 1964, 1975, and 1992 and a selected sibling in 1977 and 1993. These data provide a full record of social background, youthful aspirations, schooling, military service, family formation, labor market experiences, and social participation of the original respondents. The survey data from earlier years have been supplemented by mental ability tests (of primary respondents and 2000 of their siblings), measures of school performance, and characteristics of communities of residence, schools and colleges, employers, and industries. The WLS records for primary respondents are also linked to those of three, same-sex high school friends within the study population. Social background measures include earnings histories of parents from Wisconsin state tax records. In 1977 the study design was expanded with the collection of parallel interview data for a highly stratified subsample of 2000 siblings of the primary respondents. In the 1992-93 round of the WLS, the sample was expanded to include a randomly selected sibling of every respondent (with at least one brother or sister), and the content was extended to obtain detailed occupational histories and job characteristics; incomes, assets, and inter-household transfers; social and economic characteristics of parents, siblings, and children and descriptions of the respondents' relationships with them; and extensive information about mental and physical health and wellbeing.    The WLS sample is broadly representative of white, non-Hispanic American men and women who have completed at least a high school education. Among Americans aged 50 to 54 in 1990 and 1991, approximately 66 percent are non-Hispanic white persons who completed at least 12 years of schooling. The sample is mainly of German, English, Irish, Scandinavian, Polish, or Czech ancestry.  Some strata of American society are not well represented. Everyone in the primary sample graduated from high school; about 7 percent of their siblings did not graduate from high school. It is estimated that about 75 percent of Wisconsin youth graduated from high schools in the late 1950s. Minorities are not well-represented; there are only a handful of African American, Hispanic, or Asian persons in the sample; given the longitudinal design of the WLS, and the miniscule numbers of minorities in Wisconsin at the time the study began, there is, unfortunately, no way to remedy this omission. About 19 percent of the WLS sample is of farm origin, and that is consistent with national estimates of persons of farm origin in cohorts born in the late 1930s. As in the later, large, longitudinal studies of school-based samples, age variation occurs in repeated observations, rather than in cross- section. Also, siblings cover several adjoining cohorts; they were mainly born between 1930 and 1948. In 1964, in 1975, and again in 1992, about two thirds of the sample lived in Wisconsin, and about one third lived elsewhere in the U.S. or abroad.

PRAMS collects information from mothers about behaviors and experiences before, during and after pregnancy to learn more about how to reduce infant deaths and low birth weight births. The PRAMS project was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1987 because infant mortality rates were no longer declining as rapidly as they had in prior years. In addition, the incidence of low birth weight infants had changed little over the previous 20 years. Research has indicated that maternal behaviors and experiences during pregnancy may influence infant birth weight and mortality rates. Information collected from PRAMS is not available from other sources and provides data on smoking during pregnancy, oral health care, vaccines during pregnancy, nutrition, domestic violence, psychosocial stress, HIV testing, sexually transmitted diseases, breastfeeding and family planning. The goal of the PRAMS project is to improve the health of mothers and infants by reducing adverse outcomes such as low birth weight, infant mortality and morbidity, and maternal morbidity.

Topics specific to New York State include the following:    Oral health;   Fertility treatments;   Breastfeeding support;   Family planning;   Infant health;   Sexually transmitted diseases (STD's);   Postpartum depression.    Approximately 135 mothers are randomly selected from birth records each month. Low birth weight births are sampled at a higher rate to ensure adequate representation. The selected mothers are sampled between two and four months after giving birth. Mothers are sent questionnaires asking about their pregnancies and the time immediately after the birth of their babies. Questionnaire packets include a cover letter, question and answer sheet, a consent document, and a music CD as an incentive. If a mother does not respond after three questionnaires are sent, attempts to reach her by phone are made. Mothers are offered a $10 CVS gift card as a reward if they send back the mailed questionaire. Women contacted by phone are offered a $20 CVS gift card if they complete the survey over the phone.

The Program also has an ongoing partnership with the NC Foundation for Advanced Health Programs, Inc. of the Office of Research, Demonstrations and Rural Health Development in the NC Department of Human Resources.    The NC RHRP is working to identify problems in the rural health arena through policy-relevant analyses, the geographic and graphical presentation of data, and the dissemination of information to organizations and individuals in the health care field who can use this information for policy or administrative purposes. The Program's research involves primary data collection, analysis of large secondary data sets, and in-depth policy analysis. The Program brings together a diverse, multidisciplinary team including clinicians in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, allied health, mental health, and other professions and disciplines along with experts in biostatistics, geography, epidemiology, sociology, anthropology and political science to address complex social issues affecting rural populations.    The Program's present policy analysis and research agenda focuses on two major substantive areas: rural hospitals and healthcare delivery organizations and access. We are currently working on research projects examining the distribution of providers and the identification of underserved populations, and ramifications of health care reform for rural areas. The Program also has an active dissemination component and emphasizes the use of geographic methods in research.

Race or ethnicity per se does not cause a particular health problem or status. It is likely that factors such as income, education, access to health care, stress, and racism are among the major causes of the poorer health of minorities on many health measures, compared to whites. Few sources of health data record these types of health information, though most do have information on race or ethnicity. Showing data by race can identify specific areas of disparities and can help target resources and interventions to populations most in need.    In most data collected by the SCHS, race and ethnicity are reported as two separate dimensions. The major racial categories are white, African American, American Indian, and Asian. Ethnicity is defined as Hispanic and non-Hispanic. Thus persons of Hispanic ethnicity may be of any race, though in North Carolina most Hispanics are classified as white.    In the data on the SCHS web site, ""minority"" race or ""other races"" is often shown as a single category. Overall, African Americans comprise about 87 percent of persons of minority races in North Carolina. It would be desirable to have more information for specific minority racial groups, such as American Indians or Asians, and for persons of Latino ethnicity.

Information was collected on the number and type of physical limitations  affecting aged persons, the kind and amount of help received by impaired individuals, the costs of  health care services, the ability of impaired persons and their families to pay for care, and the  number and characteristics of impaired individuals not receiving care. A survey of the informal  caretakers of those elderly respondents was also conducted in 1982. This survey collected data on  demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the relationship between caregivers and impaired  persons, kinds of care provided, expense and time costs, inconveniences and problems, mobility  and work restrictions due to caretaking, and feelings about caretaking. The 1984 survey  re-interviewed the surviving 1982 home-dwelling cohort, but also interviewed for the first time the  chronically impaired who had been identified in 1982 and a new group who had become 65 and  impaired since 1982. Further data were collected from the next-of-kin of deceased members of the  1982 and 1984 samples and from Medicare Part A and Part B Home Health Agency payment files  for the years 1978-1986. In 1988-1989, the NLTCS replicated the 1984 wave with the addition of six-month telephone follow-ups of subsamples of institutionalized elderly and caregivers.

Buying Value builds on pioneering work in value purchasing by leading private purchasers and employer-led health groups and takes advantage of major reforms in Medicare that are moving the largest purchaser in the nation towards value purchasing in its programs. This is a trail that was blazed by many of Buying Value’s partners and through a variety of experiments funded by national foundation and private sector health care initiatives. By 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will attach nine percent of Medicare payments to purchasing based on quality. The importance of mirroring these changes in order to avoid the cost-shifting that will take place will drive the Buying Value initiative’s focus on aligning private purchasing practices with the Medicare payment reforms as well as working with State Health Exchanges and Medicaid programs to do the same.",,,,,,,,,"InfoPac",,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/2283"

According to the NJFHS, the number of uninsured non-elderly adults in New Jersey (855,000) is more than three times greater than the number of uninsured children (238,000). Sixty-three percent of uninsured children and 74 percent of uninsured adults have been without coverage for 12 months or longer. Uninsured rates among children vary geographically and by individual characteristics with the highest uninsured rates in densely populated urban areas of northeastern New Jersey. Children living in families with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level have a much higher uninsured rate than children in wealthier families. Ethnicity and immigration status are significant predictors of uninsured status among children.

A 5-minute screening procedure conducted using a handheld computer involves listing all household members along with their basic demographic data. The computer uses the demographic data in a preprogrammed selection algorithm to select zero to two sample person(s), depending on the composition of the household.

The NSDUH sample is representative of almost 98 percent of the U.S. population aged 12 years old or older.<br>  Several improvements to the survey were implemented in 2002. In addition to the name change, respondents were offered a $30 incentive payment for participation in the survey starting in 2002, and quality control procedures for data collection were enhanced in 2001 and 2002. Because of these improvements and modifications, estimates from the 2002 NSDUH should not be compared with estimates from the 2001 or earlier versions of the survey to examine changes over time. The data collected in 2002 represent a new baseline for tracking trends in substance use and other measures. <br>    NSDUH includes an extensive set of questions about risk and protective factors directed at youths aged 12 to 17.

Most countries have drawn their samples in accordance with these principles. Some countries (specifically Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania) adhered to earlier recommendations and sampled only the population over age 50 (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania provided the entire population over age 50, while Finland sampled it with progressive over-sampling). Several countries provided samples that had not been drawn specially for this project, and cover the entire population without over-sampling.    Being census-based samples, these datasets lack most of the detailed information found in specialized surveys. They have, however, several important advantages compared to other data sources: (1) because of the high sampling density, they cover various small groups of older people, information on whom is not commonly available in other sources; (2) these samples contain as much geographic detail as possible under each country¿s confidentiality requirements; (3) they include more extensive information on housing conditions than many other data sources; and (4) they provide information for a number of countries whose data were not accessible until recently.",,,,,,,,"The initial data processing has been completed for most of the fifteen countries that have submitted their samples.

Today, stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in the United States. While both blacks and whites suffer from strokes, more blacks die from strokes than whites. One purpose of REGARDS is to help scientists understand why this happens. Also, there is a geographic difference in stroke across the United States. This means that the area in which a person is living or has lived may be related to having a stroke or dying from a stroke. The place in which a person lives may be an important clue in preventing strokes. By learning more about strokes, we can help prevent the third leading cause of death in the United States.

The OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium, a statewide clinical research network and database, aims to unite researchers, clinicians, patients and stakeholders to address some of the nation’s biggest health challenges and serve as a resource for the state in facilitating health care research and improving health, health care and health policy.



Led by Elizabeth Shenkman, Ph.D., and David R. Nelson, M.D., through the UF CTSI, dozens of individuals spanning numerous institutions have collaborated to develop a framework for research infrastructure that can serve the entire state — including health system, state agency and community leaders, researchers, clinicians, human-subject protection experts, informatics experts, patients and caregivers. Formed in 2013, the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium collaboratively integrates and expands programs developed by the UF CTSI and its partners.



Together, OneFlorida partners provide health care to more than 40 percent of Floridians in the nation’s third-largest state. OneFlorida partners encompass hospitals, practice/clinic settings and physicians, which provide care for 15 million patients across all of Florida’s 67 counties.



The OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium was recently designated as one of the nation’s 13 clinical data research networks, or CDRNs, by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to accelerate the translation of promising research findings into improved patient care. The PCORI Board of Governors approved more than $7.5 million to support the ongoing development and expansion of the OneFlorida Data Trust and its involvement in PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. The funds included support to add seven health data networks to this large, collaborative initiative, which is designed to link researchers, patients, communities, clinicians, and health systems in productive research partnerships that leverage the power of big data.",,,,,,,,,"InfoPac",,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/8702"

After the labor force information has been collected for all eligible household members, supplemental questions particular to that month's interview may be asked of specific family members or the entire household. In most cases, the interviewer will conduct subsequent interviews by telephone and will not actually visit the sample unit again until the fifth month-in-sample interview, the first interview after the 8-month resting period. Over 90 percent of month-in-sample 2 through 4 and 6 through 8 interviews are conducted by telephone, either by the same interviewer or by an interviewer working at one of 3 centralized telephone interviewing centers.  The questionnaire is administered by CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview).  Completed interviews are electronically transmitted to a central processor where the responses are edited for consistency, imputations are made for missing data, and various codes are added. Based on the probability of selection, a weight is added to each household and person record so that estimates of the population by state, race, age, sex, and Hispanic origin match the population projections made by the Bureau of the Census each month.   To improve the reliability of estimates of month-to-month and year-to-year change, eight panels are used to rotate the sample each month. A sample unit is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, and then, after an 8-month rest period, for the same 4 months a year later. Each month a new panel of addresses, or one-eighth of the total sample, is introduced. Thus, in a particular month, one panel is being interviewed for the first time, one panel for the second, ..., and one panel for the eighth and final time.  Many of the summary labor force estimates are also seasonally adjusted to facilitate month-to-month comparisons.",,"Social Determinants of Health",,"Estimates obtained from the CPS include employment, unemployment, earnings, hours of work, and other indicators.

Supplemental questions to produce estimates on a variety of topics including school enrollment, income, previous work experience, health, employee benefits, and work schedules are also often added to the regular CPS questionnaire.

County-level data on health insurance coverage are not available elsewhere because neither the decennial census nor the American Community Survey contain questions on this topic. Our focus is to produce a consistent set of nation-wide estimates for sub-state areas. The program builds on the work of the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program.",,,,,,"Our use of the CPS ASEC implicitly assumes that the counties in the survey sample are representative of those not selected. The CPS was designed so that Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) are representative of their strata, primarily for unemployment, but the degree to which the CPS ASEC sample is representative for health insurance coverage is unknown. The characteristics of some counties guarantee they are included, e.g., most counties in large metropolitan areas and counties with large populations. More generally, while all counties have a nonzero probability of being included in the sample, some have higher probabilities than others. Further, the probability of selecting a county is related to its income and poverty level which, in turn, are related to the level of health insurance coverage. In the related Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, comparison of regression equations based on census data for counties in the CPS ASEC sample and equations based on all counties indicates remarkably similar results, providing some assurance that the CPS ASEC counties are largely representative of all counties for poverty. Unfortunately, the analogous test is unavailable for health insurance coverage, since there are no health insurance questions on the decennial census.","Several features of the county estimates should be noted.  We estimate the number of people with health insurance coverage. The method is a mixed effects linear regression, where the log proportion insured is modeled as a linear combination of several predictors, mostly administrative records. The proportion insured in the dependent variable is a 3-year average of county-level observations from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Although we use only the approximately 1,200 counties with CPS ASEC sample cases to estimate the equation, we estimate insurance coverage for all 3,140 counties in 2000.","Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE)","Health Maintenance Organizations ||  Health Services Research ||  Small-Area Analysis",,"We have developed experimental estimates for counties and states for 2000 for:  total population with and without health insurance coverage;  children under age 18 with and without health insurance coverage; and measures of uncertainty of the estimates.

Emory University Rollins School of Public Health (Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics); 

Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (Louisiana Tumor Registry); 

Rutgers University (New Jersey State Cancer Registry); 

University of California, San Francisco (CaPSURE: Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor); 

University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program); 

University of Utah (Utah Cancer Registry).



Surveys are administered to enrolled participants at established time points. These surveys include questions relating to the participant's quality of life and other experiences related to their prostate cancer.



To date, participants have recieved surveys at five time points: a baseline survey completed within 6 months of their prostate cancer diagnosis, and subsequent follow-up surveys administered at 6 months, 12 months (1 year), 36 months (3 years), and 60 months (5 years) post-diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,"InfoPac",,,,"https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/hsrr_search/record_details/6478"

Used together, the tools provide hospitals with a process for making fundamental, wide-ranging improvements to their medication delivery systems. Using the results of a landmark Medication Safety Self Assessment survey of over 1,400 hospitals, the Pathways team prototyped three tools. The prototypes were shared with participating hospitals whose feedback was incorporated into the ultimate design of the tools. By sharing their experience and expertise, participating hospitals ensured that the tools would reflect road-tested, practical methods for making improvements in medication safety. These resulting tools provide hospitals with a process to: 1.Incorporate medication safety initiatives into their strategic plans. 2. Perform an organization-wide risk assessment to identify areas for improvement. 3. Assess the organization's readiness to implement a bar-coding system for administering medications.   Data collected in the Institute for Safe Medication Practices Medication Safety Self Assessment (2000) provided some important facts about U.S. hospitals: *43% can easily access essential patient information.*53% can easily access drug information.*46% have standardized safe methods for communicating medication orders.*48% include patients as an active partner through effective education.*41% have instituted simple redundancies for critical medications, patients,and processes.*46% have established a nonpunitive,system-based approach to medication error reduction.
