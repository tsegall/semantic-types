Pamela,Allee,alleepa@gmail.com,(N/A),Oregon,"It is utterly unconscionable to aid and abet the planetary destruction occurring during the extraction, transport and use of fossil fuels by obediently conferring permission on the  profiting corporations to do as they wish.    I do not understand how anyone can confine an air quality question to a single state, conveniently eliminating North Dakota or any of the communities where this stuff is being mined - to the detriment of the estblished social order, the scarce water aquifers, or the planet's climate.  The Bakken oil field is visible from space!  the Alberta tar sands have become a permanently un-restorable and un-inhabitlable expanse of lands devoid of trees and water.  Likewise the Powder River basin coal strip mines, sold for pennies on the dollar to a nearly bankrupt foreign corporation. 

There is such a thing as personal integrity, and I am reminded that we used to say ""If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.""  I have worked in oil terminals and on VLCC oil tankers. Let me tell you, they stink!  Literally.  And they're dangerous!  Entire communities, including mine, are threatened by the trains and pipelines and rivers used to transport these products.   And I hope you are all smart enough to recognize the false dichotomy of the ""jobs or environment"" 'argument.'  What good is a job to a family if the climate is so unbalanced that they can live without water, if the world they leave their grandchildren is a cousin to Mars?  YOU have a responsibility to conserve our planet, and I wish you would do so.  Please use Washington State's model of casting your eyes on a wide scope,  because the quality of our environment is truly being degraded as I write this.

Dan,Luckett,dluckett@globalp.com,CPBR,OR,"CPBR is a solid employer and good corporate citizen in Columbia County.  CPBR provides a safe and environmentally conscientious workplace paying family living wages for approximately fifty people in North Columbia County.  Since its inception, CPBR has consistently been engaged with Clatskanie and the surrounding communities to reach out beyond our own employees and support those communities in which our employees live and raise families.

As General Manager, I help direct the vision and goals of the Company, which include at their foundation the safety, security and environmental stewardship of our operations.  We have assembled a team of highly skilled and trained professionals to conduct our ethanol and terminal operations and engage all tasks from perspective of how can we anticipate and prevent the unexpected.  Furthermore, we train and drill rigorously to anticipate and respond to the unexpected.

Whereas the plant might have gotten off to a shaky start with the original developer, since late 2009 the site has a consistent history of developing the full value of the asset and enhancing operational flexibility to ensure economic viability.  From four employees in December 2009, the plant has grown and flourished and looks forward to continuing to do so.  Both the terminal and ethanol operations are required to provide financial stability, but both also show bright futures and opportunities for long-term financial returns, not only to the owners and employees but to Columbia County and the State of Oregon.

I urge you to consider these points in concert with the provisions provided in the Permit.

The product that we transload is handled very safely and in a very clean way as not to harm the environment. 

The company has been good to its employees and always have held the safety of its workers as the highest priority. The company has also been good to the community providing help in terms of materials and services if called for.

Keen,Observer,DEQcrackdown@yahoo.com,Concerned Citizens of Columbia County,Oregon,"Extremely disappointed in the lack of leadership at DEQ for not imposing the maximum fine of $25,000 per day, particularly after the way Global/CPBR has deliberately thumbed its nose at DEQ regulatory compliance for over a year now.  Living near those trains is hell, and their numbers continue to increase with no regard for the wellbeing of our citizens.  Instead of the measly $117,272 levied against CPBR, barely amounting to a slap on the wrist, the DEQ should have sent the clear and strong message that our environmental protection regulations are not to be flouted, and that noncompliance absolutely will not be tolerated.  Had they received the fine that they deserve for their deliberately dishonest, dangerous, and willfully irresponsible conduct, CPBR should owe the taxpayers of Oregon more than $4.5 million.  The few jobs at stake there are insignificant compared to the potentially irreparable harm that these outside commercial interests pose to the land, air, water, and PEOPLE of our communities.  Why isn't DEQ doing its job?  Why has CPBR been allowed to continue operating month after month after month at emission levels nearly 6 times the amount permitted?  And yet now they think we should grant them permission to transfer even MORE crude, when they have already failed to perform their duties by law for smaller quantities?   As of November 2013 CPBR was handling almost 300 million gallons per year, or nearly 6 times more than the 50 million gallons per year that its permit allows.  We are at grave risk while DEQ looks the other way and these outsider oil barons laugh all the way to the bank.  DEQ, stop this abuse and do your job!",

Andy,Mechling,firemappr@yahoo.com,,OR,"I encourage DEQ to seize this opportunity to end its flawed relationship with Global Partners.  The current permit was clearly issued in error; or at best, under fraudulent pretext.

This tenant has shown clear contempt for Oregon law, and for the well-being of Oregon citizens.  Again, I urge DEQ to withdraw its current enforcement action against Global Partners; to rescind the original permit, and to evict this problem tenant if necessary.

It is my belief that Oregon DEQ does not currently have access to the type of detailed information regarding the composition of this mysterious ""Bakken Crude"" which might allow DEQ to make informed decisions regarding emergency preparedness, or  to conduct an adequate review of pertinent emissions information contained in the current permit application.

Last week, US DOT again reiterated its request for information from API in this matter; and once again, industry has responded with excuses.

A spokesman for American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) said last week: ""They have asked for parameters of crude oil that are confidential business information that our members don't share,"" 

This situation should be unacceptable to Oregon DEQ.  There are still far too many unanswered questions about this product which has caused so much destruction.

An MSDS for Bakken Light Crude, issued  in 2012, makes it clear that this substance is far MORE explosive than gasoline, not AS explosive, as many reports have indicated.  This MSDS sheet also warns of the potential for this product to react with atmosphere to create dangerous levels of H2S gas.

These are only some of the obvious problems not addressed in the current permit application.

In the permit section regarding estimates of releases of Hazardous Air Pollutants, ""n-hexane"" is listed as the only HAP expected to exceed emissions of 1 tpy.

In the section where the appropriate analytical tests  are specified , the Test for  HAPs is listed as ""TBD"".

That is simply not good enough.

I understand that there are very real limits  on Oregon DEQ here; in terms of jurisdiction and authority.  One of the few areas where DEQ DOES have real input revolves around the information that is included in those charts - in that permit.

If DEQ Actually believes that n-hexane is the HAP likely to be released in highest quantity from those operations ; then OK.
I will go along with this.  If DEQ has actually done its homework here.

I want DEQ to believe those figures are correct.  I want DEQ to obtain Proof that they are correct.  One way or another; If that permit gets approved,  Oregon DEQ will OWN those numbers.

Which I believe to be BUNK.  I believe this process has been BUNK. 

We need better from DEQ.

You must DENY This permit.  And further, the emergency contingency plan is inadequate as well as insufficient.  It does not address the locale in which the industry is situated---local family farms, monastery, nurseries, and it addresses only ethanol and not highly flammable/volitile Bakken crude oil, or the transportation through the county---And the county has no resources to cope with a major spill, explosion, or other accidental event.

1.  There was no public process that occurred when this facility went from an ethanol plant to a crude oil storage and transfer station.  This was a very significant change.  Port Westward is in the first stages of becoming an international energy hub.  It is a complex situation that will hugely impact the environment for all time.  Other cities, (e.g.Portland) and states (e.g. New York) recognize the potential danger of storing and transporting crude oil and have put a halt to trains coming through their ports until issues can be resolved.  We need to put a moratorium on permits for CPBR/Global until these issues can be discussed in a public forum.  I feel like things are happening under our noses without an opportunity to discuss the ramifications.
2.  CPBR/Global did not follow the rules for air quality permitting when they knowingly increased their supply and reported it much after the fact.  It is unacceptable that they would do so and then ask for forgiveness.  A dangerous precedent is set if they get off the hook so easily.
3.  Our emergency responders are not prepared to act following a major accident.  The tri city fire chiefs said they only (relatively) recently were made aware of the situation and are now concerned.  They would love more training.  The foam needed to fight explosive fires from crude oil is expensive and does not have a long shelf life.  CPBR/Global should not expand nor should their permit be accepted until all safety measures are in place to respond when catastrophic accidents happen.
4.  Some of the tanker cars carrying the crude oil are not new and do not meet current safety standards.  There needs to be a permit moratorium until all cars are either retrofitted to meet current safety standards or new cars are exclusively used.  Any train is only as strong as its weakest tanker car.",https://data.oregon.gov/views/f9ns-db4f/files/VmzKjgLsvUxX5NAbO_2ERQOLBG6_pomaZMzbP4f3P6c?filename=Port+Westward+letter.docx

The applicantâ€™s assertion that hotelling and maneuvering emissions from tugs and vessels into which the applicant plans to load Volatile Organic Liquid product [VOL] are â€œunrelatedâ€&#65533; fails to recognize that if the applicant were not seeking to expand operations these additional emissions would not be at issue.  While it is understood that the Air Contamination Discharge Permit is not an NEPA Environmental Impact Statement, it is strongly recommended that the hotelling and maneuvering emissions from tugs and vessels be considered, as the increased level of throughput operations sought by the applicant may be considered as an enabling action.

Additionally, there is no mention of the attendant diesel and particulate emissions from rail locomotives used on the premises of the applicant to move the rail cars into position during the unloading of VOL product when idling or in use.  Again the increase in throughput operations may be considered an enabling action.

P. Sydney,Herbert,psydneyh1@msn.com,.,OR,"I have grave concerns about issuing a new, expanded air quality permit in the face of the applicant's violation of the existing permit.  It would be entirely proper to have a moratorium on shipment of oil while the permit is being considered, and to levy a fine more consistent with the nature of the offense.  Allowing business as usual, and levying a fine that is a slap on the wrist sends the wrong message to all applicants for air quality permits.

DEQ is adamant that they do not regulate trains. Nevertheless, DEQ has a duty to protect the public by whatever means is at their disposal. DEQ could protect the public by the aforesaid moratorium while other forces (i.e. public opinion, investigative reporting, legislative action, executive action) were brought to bear.  It is simply appalling that the State agencies which are supposed to regulate do not do so, and conceal their failures from the public.  

The immediate issue is that highly explosive materials are being transported, in great quantity, in defective tank cars throughout the State of Oregon, and, particularly, in the ecologically delicate Columbia Gorge.  A longer term issue is whether it is in the public interest to facilitate the transport and export of fossil fuels at all.

I urge the DE to face up to the situation, and use such powers as the agency has to protect the public: by denying the after-the-fact expansion of the air quality permit, and by reconsidering the existing permit. ",

OIl from North Dakota has proven to be explosive and unsafe to transport. The danger of spills and accidents  to communities along the rail lines is magnified by the danger to the Clatskanie community from storage facilities , from transporting oil via trains and vessels, and from offloading and loading operations in the port.  
Air quality is particularly at risk. Explosions of crude oil from North Dakota resulting from train wrecks created clouds of toxic smoke from fires that are extremely difficult to extinguish, resulting in evacuation of homes and businesses in the surrounding area.
Investing in more capacity and infrastructure for dirty, dangerous fossil fuels diverts resources sorely need to build a clean energy economy.
Expansion of the Port Westward crude oil terminal would be  a huge setback for Oregon's efforts to lead in clean, renewable energy. It would offer incentives to extract more and more oil from North Dakota and possibly from the tar sands of Alberta with inreased  harm to our climate. 
Columbia Pacific Bio-Refinery has already violated its existing permit, exceeding permitted handling of crude oil by over 200 milli0on gallons in 2013. No way should this company be rewarded by allowing the huge expansion it has requested.",
