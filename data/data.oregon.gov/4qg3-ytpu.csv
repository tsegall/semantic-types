â€¢	In September 2015, the BLM received approximately 23,000 comments in support of the proposed withdrawal, including from local governments, businesses, water districts, and tribes seeking to protect critical river headwaters. Red Flat Nickel Corporation and American Exploration and Mining Association, a large industry trade group, were among only 20 commenters that opposed the withdrawal. 

â€¢	More than 500 local citizens testified in favor of protecting local watersheds and rivers from nickel strip mining at public meetings hosted by the U.S. Forest Service and BLM in Grants Pass and Gold Beach in September of 2015.

â€¢	According to the U.S. EPA, metal mining is the most polluting industry in America.

â€¢	At risk are pure drinking water for local communities, wild river strongholds for salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat, public lands that support a treasure trove of botanical diversity, and outstanding outdoor recreation opportunities, including fishing, hiking, whitewater rafting and kayaking

â€¢	U.S. Senators Wyden (D-OR) and Merkley (D-OR) and U.S. Representatives DeFazio (D-OR) and Huffman (D-CA) introduced legislation, the Southwest Oregon Salmon and Watershed Protection Act, in February 2015 in response to the local community concerns about the threat of nickel strip mining to clean water and salmon runs in the area near the OR-CA border known as the â€œWild Rivers Coastâ€&#65533;.

â€¢	The delegation requested that the US Forest Service and the Secretary of Interior implement the withdrawal for the ""full 20-year period to provide meaningful protection and to give Congress sufficient time to consider longstanding agency recommendations for the future management of these lands, new information regarding their values, and the public's sentiment and views."" 

â€¢	In response to the request, the USFS and the BLM initiated a temporary two-year mineral withdrawal to gather public input and prepare the required analysis and reports. The USFS is expected to release an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed withdrawal in April 2016.

Lori,Turbes,loriturbes@yahoo.com,Sundance Kayak School,OR,"The North Fork Smith River is a pristine gem to the whitewater community. I frequently kayak on this section of river and enjoy taking new kayakers down for their first time. Every time a new kayaker experiences the North Fork, they are extremely impressed and can't wait to return. Hundreds of small waterfalls enter the North Fork as you paddle downstream. There are thousands of the rare Darlingtonia Californica that thrive on the rivers banks. I was surprised when I saw a river otter on the upper portion of the North Fork. That was a first for me! The North Fork Smith is the headwaters for the Wild and Scenic Smith River in California. By designating the North Fork under the Outstanding Resources Waters, the complete river system has a chance to stay pristine and untouched by the strip mining threats. It would be such a shame to have the entire lower river system protected just to leave the most important headwaters section vulnerable to water contamination. Attached is a photo of the North Fork Smith River. Hundreds of kayakers each year travel near and far for a chance to float on this pristine river. If the EQC can designate the North Fork Smith River under the Outstanding Resource Waters, it will ensure that current and future generations can experience this rare, pristine river in it's entirety.

Again, as you know, California has is considering similar protection of the lower part of the Smith River watershed, just because of the entire North Fork Smith RIver watershed's importance for clean drinking water, salmon, and recreation

There are very few rivers with anandromous access left in the lower 48 states.

Strip mining and logging companies cannot provide protection or mitigation that truly replicates wilderness. Such areas are never truly returned to their former state.

Bradlee,Welton,bwelton44@gmail.com,visitor and user of the NF Smith,CA,"The NF Smith River and its tributaries in SW Oregon should be designated as Outstanding Resource Waters. This designation would make consistent and appropriate the resource management of this watershed which deserves to be managed holistically, rather than piecemeal simply because an arbitrary State line was drawn 150 years ago cutting the headwaters of the watershed away from the rest of the river watershed downstream. The Congress has protected the entire watershed of the Smith River located in California as the Smith River National Recreation Area (NRA), including the NF of the Smith.  The reason this watershed was protected by both the State of California and US government was because such protections would protect drinking water for downstream communities, protect wildlife and the fisheries so dependent on clean water and would protect the travel, recreation and tourist economies dependent on the natural wonder of this spectacular national treasure.  
 I have been to the NF Smith River and consider it one of the most beautiful and unique places in the world.   The river is pristine and the water is pure.  You can see large wild salmon and steelhead in the pools. 

Additionally, some of the largest old growth Redwoods on the planet live adjacent to and depend on the Smith River in Redwood National Park and in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park.

Water quality degradation created by industrial mining operations in the headwaters of this already recognized and highly protected river watershed downstream would be a travesty and complete failure of environmental integrity and governmental responsibility and accountability to the public.

As a fish biologist who has had the pleasure of working throughout the Smith River watershed, and in every other watershed in Northern California, I have firsthand experience in recognizing how special and diverse the watershed and its fisheries are.  The North fork Smith in particular is unique in that its diverse geology and thus habitats lend to diverse and abundant fish populations, regarded as unique within the Smith River Watershed as a whole.  For example the NF Smith supports a coho salmon population which has evolved to survive in those unique habitats.   For the ecological, recreational and economic values that the North Fork Smith River contains, it is no question that it should be designated as an Outstanding Resource Waters.  ",

The Wild and Scenic North Fork Smith River watershed is home to some of Oregonâ€™s most extraordinarily high quality water and critical habitat for wild winter steelhead, fall Chinook, searun cutthroat, and protected Coho salmon as required for a designation. Because of the importance of the North Fork Smith River and the entire Smith River watershed for clean drinking water, salmon and recreation the State of California is initiating a similar and complimentary process downstream.  California and other states have routinely protected their highest quality waters under the Clean Water Act as the Commission is considering. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

We need to protect the Smith River and it's tributaries from folks who don't care what happens to it just to make a buck.

At a time when our natural resources are suffering from the scourge of the social welfare billionaire class, it is important to preserve the last pristine areas of our country - intact, free and forever wild. There is so little left now that can claim that. It is not too much to ask to leave this entire system alone when all the rest has been altered and even destroyed forever. This land belongs to all of us, past, present and future, and, not to a select few. 

Respect the wishes of the American people that you serve, and not the special interests. Do your job and advocate for the common American who wishes to bask in wild land, untouched and unmarred. We the people demand it.",

I also conferred with geologists from Hanna Mining which had carried out drilling and trenching projects over many of the lands in the Smith River watershed. Their findings matched what I found, no indication of sufficient tonnages of any form of nickel ore in lands beyond Gasquet Mountain. The best uses for these lands today should be protection for Outstanding Resource Waters. Thank you for taking my comments.

Katie,Petrick,katherine.petrick@gmail.com,,OR,"The North Fork of the Smith and its tributaries represent a truly pristine watershed that provides irreplaceable home to many species, recreation, clean water, and exquisite beauty to the region. Mining in the area would irreparable damage the watershed and taint its crystal clear water. While industry is important, mining in such an area would be a devastating and irresponsible use of land. Watersheds as pristine as the North Fork Smith are rare and ever dwindling in number and their protection is everyone's responsibility. It is of utmost importance that the North Fork of Smith and its Tributaries be designated as Outstanding Resource Water. Its importance to the communities that are touched by it as well as to the ocean that it feeds into are undisputed.  To allow the potential for mining here would open the possibility of water disasters such as those seen in the mining communities of West Virginia. The Environment Quality Commission should learn from the mistakes that have critically damaged water sources in the East and make the move to protect these resource waters on the West coast. ",

I respectfully request that the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission initiate rulemaking to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;

The pristine Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. With stretches within several protected state parks, the important, unique and ecologically sensitive North Fork Smith River has been recommended by numerous environmental organizations, and senior staff of the California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, as deserving the highest water quality designation of Outstanding National Resource Waters. Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes.

Take action to defend the North Fork Smith River from strip mining and other harmful activities by giving the river the best protection possible. A petition before the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission seeks to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries as â€œOutstanding Natural Resource Watersâ€&#65533; to protect public health and welfare, wildlife, fish and aquatic life, and many beneficial uses of the stateâ€™s waters. This designation would also protect the river and its tributaries from a strip mine that is proposed in Baldface Creek watershed, a tributary to the North Fork Smith River. Comments are due by April 19th.

The Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last undammed major rivers in the U.S. and deserves the best protection that can be given to ensure its pristine condition is maintained for future generations. The protected waterways of the Smith River provide as habitat for Coho salmon and the last uninfected stands of Port Orford cedar in the world. The Smith River is considered one of the crown jewels of the region as the river winds through the old growth forests of Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. The North Fork Smith River and its tributaries serve as valuable wildlife habitat corridors providing connectivity between protected wilderness and park areas.

There are currently no waters in Oregon that are designated as Outstanding Natural Resource Waters, but there is no better candidate than the Smith River. Designation as â€œOutstandingâ€&#65533; would help protect it from a proposed strip mine. In recent years, the Canadian based Red Flat Nickel Corporation has proposed a nickel strip mine near the river. While the proposal was denied, the foreign corporation has appealed the process. The best way to protect the river into the future from this threat and others is to designate it as an Outstanding Natural Resource Water.

I respectfully request that the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission initiate rulemaking to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;

The pristine Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. With stretches within several protected state parks, the important, unique and ecologically sensitive North Fork Smith River has been recommended by numerous environmental organizations, and senior staff of the California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, as deserving the highest water quality designation of Outstanding National Resource Waters. Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes. All of these features place the Smith River as a top quality Outstanding National Resource Water.. It is our duty to take action to ensure this pristine river is protected for future generations.

I respectfully request that the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission initiate rulemaking to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;

The pristine Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. With stretches within several protected state parks, the important, unique and ecologically sensitive North Fork Smith River has been recommended by numerous environmental organizations, and senior staff of the California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, as deserving the highest water quality designation of Outstanding National Resource Waters. Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes.

Mercedes,Lackey,helloelsie@gmail.com,,OK,"Please protect the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries.  The National Wild and Scenic North Fork Smith River flows through a rugged ancient land of steep canyons, broad peneplains, stark open serpentine terrain and granitic islands of old diverse forests. Itâ€™s a wild river of the purest of waters and a near pristine National Forest watershed. All of the North Fork Smith Riverâ€™s watershed should be permanently protected.  Approximately 60% of the riverâ€™s watershed in Oregon is open to mining. Itâ€™s hereâ€”in the North Forkâ€™s pristine headwaters and most productive salmon and steelhead habitatâ€”that the greatest threat to Californiaâ€™s iconic Smith River is foundâ€”nickel laterite mining.   Of all the riverâ€™s tributaries, the North Fork Smith River is considered to have the most outstanding water clarity.[2] The North Fork Smith River provides pure drinking water for the community of Gasquet, California where it joins the Middle Fork Smith. The Smith River downstream is the drinking water source for Crescent City, Hiouchi and the Redwood National And State Parks â€“ in other words much of Del Norte County.  The fisheries value of the North Fork Smith [River] is outstandingly remarkable due to its substantial contribution to the world-class fishery of the greater Smith River watershed. The North Fork Smith provides nearly seven miles of near-pristine steelhead spawning and rearing habitat and is a significant source of the high quality water on which the anadromous fishery of the Smith River depends.â€&#65533;[3]

â€œThe North Fork Smith is known for its outstanding water quality and for its ability to clear quickly following storms. Low turbidity and lack of pollutants contribute to the riverâ€™s excellent habitat and high fisheries value â€¦ The water quality was determined to be Outstandingly Remarkable value primarily due to its substantial contribution to the river setting and to the overall functioning of the river ecosystem.

Fish habitat in the North Fork of the River watershed is in near-pristine condition and functions to produce high numbers of anadromous fish.The North Fork of the Smith River watershed provides near-pristine spawning and rearing habitat for a highly productive fishery â€¦ Fall chinook, Klamath Mountain Province steelhead, anadromous cutthroat trout, resident rainbow and cutthroat trout use the watershed. The watershed appears to be an exceptional producer of anadromous cutthroat trout.",

This would protect public health and welfare, and wildlife, fish and aquatic life. This designation would also protect the river and its tributaries from a strip mine that is proposed in Baldface Creek watershed, a tributary to the North Fork Smith River. 

The protected waterways of the Smith River provide habitat for Coho salmon and the last uninfected stands of Port Orford cedar in the world. It is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. 

The Smith River is a focal point for Redwood National Park, Redwood State Park-an UNESCO world heritage site,and Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas.

This ominous development may well end our experiment in representative democracy unless we alter this decades-long trend.  For the sake of the republic, we must amend the US Constitution to state that corporations are not people (and do not have constitutional rights) and money is not speech (and thus can be regulated by state and/or federal campaign finance laws).

I respectfully request that the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission initiate rulemaking to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;

The pristine Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. With stretches within several protected state parks, the important, unique and ecologically sensitive North Fork Smith River has been recommended by numerous environmental organizations, and senior staff of the California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, as deserving the highest water quality designation of Outstanding National Resource Waters. Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes. All of these features place the Smith River as a top quality Outstanding National Resource Water.. It is our duty to take action to ensure this pristine river is protected for future generations.

Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes. All of these features place the Smith River as a top quality Outstanding National Resource Water.. It is our duty to take action to ensure this pristine river is protected for future generations.

As a citizen of Oregon I strongly urge you to initiate a rulemaking process to consider designating the North Fork Smith and all of its tributaries and wetlands as Outstanding Resource Waters. The Wild and Scenic North Fork Smith River watershed is home to some of Oregonâ€™s most extraordinarily high quality water and critical habitat for wild winter steelhead, fall Chinook, searun cutthroat, and protected Coho salmon as required for a designation. Because of the importance of the North Fork Smith River and the entire Smith River watershed for clean drinking water, salmon and recreation the State of California is initiating a similar and complimentary process downstream.  California and other states have routinely protected their highest quality waters under the Clean Water Act as the Commission is considering. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

I respectfully request that the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission initiate rulemaking to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;

The pristine Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. With stretches within several protected state parks, the important, unique and ecologically sensitive North Fork Smith River has been recommended by numerous environmental organizations, and senior staff of the California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, as deserving the highest water quality designation of Outstanding National Resource Waters. Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes.

I respectfully request that the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission initiate rulemaking to designate the North Fork Smith River and its tributaries and wetlands as â€œOutstanding Resource Waters of Oregon.â€&#65533;

The pristine Wild and Scenic Smith River is one of the last un-dammed rivers in the country. With stretches within several protected state parks, the important, unique and ecologically sensitive North Fork Smith River has been recommended by numerous environmental organizations, and senior staff of the California North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, as deserving the highest water quality designation of Outstanding National Resource Waters. Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.

The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes. All of these features place the Smith River as a top quality Outstanding National Resource Water.. It is our duty to take action to ensure this pristine river is protected for future generations.

Designating the North Fork Smith River as an Outstanding National Resource Water will protect the ecology of the river as well as the other use values we currently enjoy. Designation as Outstanding National Resource Water will close antidegradation policy loop holes to prevent degradation of the River from pollution.
The Outstanding National Resource Waters designation would better safeguard national values that include: protection of critical habitat for the West Coastâ€™s last Coho salmon and a botanical riparian legacy of the last uninfected stands of Port Orford Cedar in the world; enjoyment of a recreational treasure, including small water craft boating and fishing; the longest stretch of National and State Wild and Scenic River (over 300 miles); and an aesthetic focal point for both Redwood National and State Park, which is an UNESCO world heritage site, as well as Smith River National Recreation Area, which traverses wilderness and roadless areas. Also included in this long list of beneficial uses is supplying most of Del Norte County with the highest quality drinking water, and an important cultural heritage resource of the Tolowa Native American Tribes. All of these features place the Smith River as a top quality Outstanding National Resource Water.. It is our duty to take action to ensure this pristine river is protected for future generations.

The Smith is truly on of the last remaining ecologically great rivers remaining within the United States and deserves to be protected with as much environmental rigor as possible so as to insure it's natural complexity and abundance into the future. Short sighted mineral withdrawals permanently degrade the land and should not be allowed in a place such as this. As an avid steelhead angler I very much appreciate this place and believe it's protection will benefit America as a whole. Not protecting it will only benefit multinational mineral exploitation companies. Please cease all mineral withdrawal on the North Fork Smith and all watersheds within the Smith, Chetco, and Illinois watersheds.

The North Fork is a Wild and Scenic river with outstanding water quality. Any impacts on that quality would have lasting negative effects on fish and wildlife, and on downstream communities that rely on the Smith River for drinking water and as the base of the local recreation economy. It would also damage its unique character as a whitewater run.
Impacts on the North Fork's headwaters will be felt throughout the entire river:   The pristine condition of its headwaters is the reason for its rare and impeccable water quality. ",
