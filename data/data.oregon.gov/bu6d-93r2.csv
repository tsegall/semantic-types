Aaron ,Donley,AaronD@WasteConnections.com,Sanipac Inc. ,OR,"Hello, regarding SB263 we have 2 comments/recommendations:

1.	Regarding section 5 of the Waste Prevention and Reuse Programs, entitled, â€œEducation program in schools,â€&#65533; section B, â€œeducation program must address students in both elementary and secondary schoolsâ€¦â€&#65533; 

Due to demands on classroom time it can be difficult to add curricular activities beyond what is already required.  We recommend a municipality be able to meet this requirement by incorporating an interactive/educational booth on waste prevention and reuse to their already existing Public Works Week field trip in which all 4th grade students attend.  

2.	Regarding section 6 of the Waste Prevention and Reuse Programs, entitled, â€œFunding or infrastructure support program,â€&#65533; section C, â€œAnnual funding must be no less than $0.25 per local government unit resident up to 100,000 in populationâ€¦â€&#65533;: 

We feel the amount of support listed could be burdensome for a municipality to implement.  Is this dollar amount based on cost examples of an actual event(s) meeting the minimum requirement? For example, in a city with a population of 100,000, it seems excessive to require a $25,000 funding commitment to facilitate a 2 day event.  Does the expected participation level warrant this amount of funding to meet the interest/needs of the public?: â€œInfrastructure support must result in a reuse, repair, lease, or sharing opportunity that is provided continuously or on at least 1 day per year for every 50,000 in the local government unitâ€™s populationâ€¦â€&#65533;

We recommend the minimum funding portion be removed and proof of compliance in holding this event(s) be sufficient. 

Thank you for your consideration on these issues. 

Best,
