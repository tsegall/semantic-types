Kelley,Meck,khmeck@gmail.com,none,Oregon,"Averting climate change of more than two degrees Celsius must be a major policy priority for Oregon, where our quality of life, our economy, and many of our livelihoods are tied to an environment that will be badly, permanently damaged by climate change of that magnitude. Creating new coal projects at this stage in the world's efforts to address climate change is irresponsible and immoral. Let's not do it.",General,
Jennifer,Young,jbeayoung@hotmail.com,,OR,"Issuing a permit for coal export is an all around bad idea for Oregon and affected states. 
There will be damage to salmon and smelt runs that are endangered and increase toxins in any harvested fish. Exports will increase acidity in rain in oversees unregulated coal burning that will cause tree die off and increasing forest fires along with  coastal water pollution that prevent shell fish formation and damge the econonmy. The exports alone will increase train traffic through many neighborhoods in Portland that were not designed for heavy diesel transport. Eastern Oregon is already overburdend with years of heavy pollution from the Boardman coal fired plant. I want Ambre to be held legally liable for damages for any increases in asthma for affected populations that live and work in and around the Morrow facilites and shipping containers. DEQ must make an official Health Impact Statement for local communities and provide statistics for health research before the faciltiy is built to demonstrate the progression of disease though exposure to stray coal dust and diesel fumes.

Project developer Ambre Energy has demonstrated a commitment to protecting Oregon’s air and water quality and fish and wildlife habitat at every stage of the proposed project.

We’ve reviewed the Morrow Pacific project proposal and designs and are confident that the proven processes used to store and transfer coal at the Port of Morrow will go beyond standard practices to eliminate dust and spillage. For example, railcars will be unloaded in a completely enclosed storage facility. No coal will be visible from outside the facility, which looks similar to grain or food-processing facilities found today in Morrow County. And enclosed conveyors will transfer the coal to covered barges, built specifically for this project.

We need to move beyond coal in light of the significant effect it has on the CO2 level in the atmosphere and its impact on global warming.

This is dirty coal that will be exported to other foreign countries where it will be burned without even the relatively lax controls the United States requires for its coal-fired plants. The effluvia generated from those East Asian coal-fired sites will drift back to this country, leaving us as precisely the definition of a third-world country: we export our natural resources for profits that leave the region and get stuck for the bill to clean up the inevitable damage. There is no good that can come from this.

I urge you to deny all permits for this project, on the many grounds presented to you over and over BY THE PEOPLE OF OREGON WHO DO NOT WANT OUR STATE DESTROYED BY THIS KIND OF EXPLOITATION.

1.	Coal is toxic and DEQ should stop toxic pollution. DEQ should not allow coal dust from
trains and terminals to pollute our river and our lungs.
2.	It is foolish for DEQ to only look at one small part of the coal export project â€“ the coal storage site at the Port of Morrow.
a.	What about the uncovered coal trains spilling coal dust in the Columbia River? b.	Or a new coal dock at Port of Morrow that would harm salmon? c.	Or the impact of a huge increase in barging on the Columbia? d.	Or the air and water impacts of the OTHER coal terminal where Ambre would
transfer coal from barges to ships? This terminal is proposed in a salmon nursery
219 miles downstream from the Port of Morrow at Port Westward. e.	Or the impacts of new coal barges on the Columbia Gorge Scenic Area or coal
ships on the Columbia River Estuary?
3.	Instead of putting on blinders and ignoring the full impacts, DEQ should require a Clean Water Act 401 certification to consider all of the impacts of Ambreâ€™s coal â€“ from the trains to the ships.
a.	DEQ can require a Clean Water Act section 401 certification to look at the water quality impacts of the entire coal project â€“ from train to ship â€&#65533; has the authority.
i.	Under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, DEQ can evaluate whether Ambreâ€™s entire project complies with Oregonâ€™s water quality standards.
DEQ can consider the impacts of coal dust, barges, a new dock, and ships
on salmon and other river life. b.	DEQ should notify Ambre immediately that a 401 certification is necessary for
their industrial dock at the Port of Morrow. c.	It is unacceptable for DEQ to give Ambre a free pass by waiving its 401 authority
i.	Doesnâ€™t DEQ want to know the full impacts? ii.	Why would DEQ waive its right to conduct a 401 certification and protect
the Columbia River from dirty coal?
4.	Without 401 certification, there are large gaps in government review.
a.	Ask DEQ: Who is going to check if the coal barges will harm the Columbia River? The Army Corps will not review, and responding to spills is not enough.
b.	Ask DEQ: Who is going to evaluate the impact of coal ships and barges in the salmon nursery at Port Westward?
5.	Oregon should not piecemeal coal permits.
a.	The Oregon Department of State Lands made the prudent decision to require the full analysis of impacts before issuing any permits.
i.	Why is DEQ plowing ahead? ii.	The State should act in a coordinated manner.
6.	Air permit â€“ DEQ should deny the air discharge permit because Ambreâ€™s coal terminal and tugs will violate Oregonâ€™s air quality standards.
a.	DEQ has no experience reviewing a coal export terminal. DEQ should wait for the full federal analysis.
b.	DEQ should evaluate the air impacts from the Port Westward end of the project. Why look at only half of the project?
7.	Reputation â€“ Ambre has a bad history of lying to public officials and DEQ should not trust Ambre.
a.	Ambre lied to the State of Washington and Cowlitz County about the size of a project in Longview, purposefully getting permits for a 5 million ton per year coal export facility while secretly planning 60 million tons per year.

We ended up buying an affordable house in Kenton, near the railroad. When I learned about Ambre Energy and Kinder Morgan's plans to export coal on these tracks from Montana through the Columbia Gorge I was horrified.
Dirty coal trains will diminish property values and hurt small farms and businesses. If we export coal we import toxic air not just from coal falling off the trains but also from Asia’s easterly wind patterns. People with asthma and other respiratory illnesses’ health will worsen.
 Rural areas and rail communities can invest in clean local energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and methane gas from agriculture.  We do need jobs, and local energy solutions will put us to work and reduce energy bills. The Pacific NW can lead America's transition from the outdated dirty energy of the past to 21-century clean energy solutions.
 Let's make the NW coal-free and protect our heritage as a clean healthy environment people like me would like to move to, not away from.

Fred,Thompson,fthompso@willamette.edu,Willamette University,OR,"I have rarely seen a more carefully conceived infrastructure project. If this project is not permitted, we might as well close down the state and go back where we came from. Most of the opposition appears to be largely symbolic in nature, addressed to thwarting the evil of CO2 emissions, which burning coal involves. But the US is already exporting 125 million tons of coal per year almost without comment. This facility, even if it were to operate at full capacity, represents less than 2 percent of China's annual increase in imports alone. The present value environmental costs of burning this coal (8.8 million tons), works out to about $215 million per annum, vs. economic value added of 2-2.5 times that amount. To the extent that it is true that East Asians are willing to pay a premium price for this coal because they want to substitute it for the dirty lignite they would otherwise burn, allowing these facilities to be built would actually reduce present value environmental costs worldwide by $10-25 million per annum.

Toni,Montgomery,teddybear.bandt@q.com,,Washington,"I would encourage the Corp of Engineers to do a comprehensive study of coal from the mine to the Port of Morrow. The Governors of Washington and Oregon have requested this. The damage to the Columbia River is greater than just the area at the Port of Morrow. The coal industry is pushing for the study to be for the Port only because they know of the impacts they are crating all along the route.
Disregarding all other impacts is a dis-service to all who will suffer from coal on the rail is unacceptable. You must look at the damage to the agriculture industry along the rail line, along with the impact to bees. We can't afford to disregard this impact as the scope is much broader than one Port.

The chance for a superfund clean up on the Columbia River is great. Derailments happen frequently for coal trains. This has already happened in Washington.

Research shows that barges and trains can arrive at the Ports with their coal cargo on fire. We can't afford a burning barge on the Columbia River. 

The risks to humans and the environment far out way the very small amount of full time employment crated by this coal Port. According to testimony by a Morrow County Commissioner at a hearing held by Ron Wyden, the Port of Morrow will employ 12 full time employees. This will not offset the chances of a devastating spill on our waterway. 

We taxpayers spend billions of our tax money to protect the Columbia River. Why would it be a good idea to risk all our  work on preserving the health of our river. One spill and a superfund cleanup would cost more than we can afford.

Historically, coal has not served us well. That is why the US is opposed to coal. Coal has not been a clean partner at Ports as evidenced by the Port in Vancouver Canada. All we are asking is that this is a fair scoping and include everything that the Oregon Governor has asked. That is a full Comprehensive Study. 

It is your job to protect and defend our water. Please look at all the past and present evidence regarding coal Ports. We learn from the past and this is how our Government came to the conclusion that coal companies practices are harmful to human, animals and the environment.

This is the wrong thing to do with all the evidence we have over generations. You have been asked to do a full Comprehensive Study by Government and public alike. The only group that does not want the full study are those that want to pad their pockets at the expense of all.

Jim,Steitz,jimsteitz@mac.com,,TN,"I write in strongest opposition to any permit for the ""Coyote Island Terminal"" coal terminal at Boardman, Oregon, sought by Ambre Energy. This terminal would constitute an ecological disaster at every step in the life-cycle of the coal, from its mining, through transport, to combustion in its intended Chinese power plants. The Boardman export terminal frustrates the maintenance of a planet that can sustain human life, and serves no other valid purpose, and must therefore be rejected by the Army Corps of Engineers.

This project is one of five such export terminal proposals that would export on the order of 150 million tons of coal through the Pacific Northwest. This volume of coal would constitute an unmitigated ecological disaster, in violent opposition to the state's objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The State of Oregon must reject these proposals, starting with the terminal at Boardman. This Oregon state government has expressed an overall goal of moving Oregon toward a lower-carbon economy, and to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. If these goals are to have any meaningful policy expression within the agencies, such as Department of Environmental Quality, tasked with carrying out a governor's policy, then DEQ cannot issue this permit at Morrow Pacific. This terminal would be linked via Columbia River barge to some of the larges carbon bombs in North America, namely the coalfields of the Intermountain West and Great Plains, and human survival demands that this coal remain securely underground.

The ""Coyote Island Terminal"" terminal, and its sister proposals along the Pacific Northwest coast, would be especially and painfully ironic for a state that has otherwise made admirable and meritorious progress in shifting to clean energy and ecological sustainability more broadly. I am a former resident both of the Oregon coast (Newport) and of inland Oregon, and I can scarcely fathom the horrific reversal of ecological paradigm that these coal-export terminals would constitute. Oregon's role in the global energy infrastructure would invert from a leader in the low-carbon transition, to a conduit of death for the highest-carbon fuels on Earth. The State of Oregon has already committed itself to regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives, and even though the initiatives are not yet self-enforcing, these coal-export terminals would dwarf any carbon reductions attained in those frameworks. It therefore is a contrary and irreconcilable public policy.

Even the smallest scope of environmental analysis, the terminal itself and the proximate impact to the local natural and human environment, is grossly unacceptable. The coal barge traffic, local air and water pollution, congestion, and destruction of the community ambiance, would transform the local area into a purgatory of industrial misery. The residents of Boardman, and other communities for whom this permit would set a precedent, did not necessarily move there to experience one of America's largest commodity export projects operating more hours than not. Persons wishing a full-time industrial experience have ample other places in America to live, and the vicinity of Port of Morrow need not be one of them.

Again, please reject the permit for the ""Coyote Island Terminal"" coal export terminal at Boardman. This terminal would transform Oregon from a hopeful flicker of a green economy into a veritable launching pad from which Ambre Energy can fire weapons of mass destruction against our global climate.

I have not been able to find one good reason to allow the Morrow Pacific Project to be approved.  I know that jobs and money for schools have been promised.  However, these are short-term proposals while ignoring long-term devastation to our region.
 
As Oregonians, I know the state process of approval is very complicated.  I feel strongly that an Environmental Impact Statement, similar to the process the State of Washington has in place, must be conducted.  Coal trains are already polluting the air, water and land in the Columbia Gorge.  If the number increases, it will be detrimental to our orchards, our water, our health, our quality of life and eventually our growing economy.  The idea, that polluting the Northwest, so a company can make endless amounts of money, is unimaginable and inexcusable.  
 
Sending covered barges down the Columbia River, without an emergency plan or services available to contain the fire, is concern enough to not approve this project.  Letting the barge and coal burn in the Columbia River is not an acceptable plan!
 
Decisions such as this, will impact our communities and region for generations.  It will change living in the Northwest for the worse, and encourage our children to leave the region they now call home.

This sounds to me like a carefully worded disclaimer, attempting to mislead the reader into believing that there will be little or no environmental impact.  The fact that the human sensory system may not be able to detect the presence of coal dust does not mean that it does not exist and that it will not have a detrimental effect. There are other public safety issues as well that make this a very risky venture with little gain for the public.  Please deny the final permit for this project and protect Oregonians from the pollution it is likely to create.

Sandy,Toms,sktoms@centurylink.net,City of Boardman,Oregon,"I wanted to write to you regarding my support for the Coyote Island Terminal here in Boardman.  Youâ€™re about to vote on a resolution to oppose this project, and I wanted to send along some facts as I believe they are sorely lacking in this debate.  I wish I could be there in person to speak with you, but since Iâ€™m unable to travel I hope this letter will suffice.

When it comes to transporting and burning coal there is probably no other city in Oregon that can speak with more authority than Boardman.  Since 1975, our city has had a 550 Mw coal-burning power plant that has generated significant energy for citizens throughout the PGE system, including in Beaverton.  Since its beginning, that plant has been served by rail cars that bring coal in from out of state.  In these forty years there have been no reported health impacts in our communities tied to the transportation of that coal.  As an elected official and resident of Boardman, I would never endorse a project that I thought was detrimental to the health of our residents.

Not only is it my role to help safeguard the public health, itâ€™s also my role to develop an economy that brings job opportunities to our families.  And thatâ€™s what the Coyote Island Terminal will do.  According to ECONorthwest, a respected economic research firm, this project will bring 2100 construction jobs and over 1000 ongoing operations jobs and not only that, help our local school district.  Thatâ€™s great for us.  But, as you probably know, this project will not utilize rail for the transportation of coal west of Boardman.  We will load it on covered barges, which will carry it to the Port of St. Helens for export.  Those barges will be built by Gunderson Marine, and they have said that work will result in the creation of 300 jobs.  No doubt some of those workers will be residents of your city.

As somebody who has lived with coal on a daily basis, perhaps itâ€™s just that weâ€™re used to it.  But, I understand that it is a resource that creates a great deal of emotion.  What I find, though, is that debate is seldom governed by facts.  We can safely transport coal.  We know in Boardman because weâ€™ve been doing it for years.

Thank you for taking time to read my thoughts, and I wish I could be there in person.

John,Dawson,dawsonjohnkatie@yahoo.com,Citizen,OR,"I am opposed to granting an Air Quality Permit to Amber Energy.

Having read the draft permits, I did not see any consideration given to the probability of fires occurring at the facility proposed by Amber Energy.  Powder River Basin coal is notorious for spontaneous combustion when it is not adequately compacted to reduce the oxygen available to stacked coal.  The Boardman Fire Department has dealt with many incidences over the last thirty years when loaded coal cars were left on the sidings in town and started burning.  Their only recourse in such events was to flood the cars with water until they could be unloaded at the PGE coal plant.  

I submit that fires at this facility are not only a danger to firefighters and to the facility itself,  but will definitely have adverse air quality effects.  A fire anywhere in the facility will be difficult to suppress, meaning that the smoke will be a problem for an un-knowable length of time.  If the fire occurs in the storage building, which is most likely if not adequately compacted, then the fire will be extremely difficult to combat and extinguish.  A fire in the storage building could easily last for weeks or months.

Any permit for this facility should address the likelihood of fire and have an adequate method in place for extinguishing any such fire.  Small fires around the conveyors are not so difficult to control, but fires in the coal pile itself are very difficult and dangerous.  Very few fire departments could be relied upon to control this type of fire.",Air Quality Permit,

While I read that there will be no coal dust escapement during the barge loading process, I do not believe it.  I have worked with sub bituminous coal for many years, and it is extremely dusty.  Maybe they can find the technology to suppress the dust, but I am skeptical.

On another matter, Powder River Basin coal is very prone to self combustion when it is stacked or piled without compaction.  I can only imagine what a barge crew will be able to do when they discover that a barge of coal is on fire.  The only available options are to replace the oxygen in the barge with an inert gas(this really doesn't work very well), flood it with water (this might sink the barge, releasing the entire load of coal into the river), or to unload the burning coal.  The latter is of coarse dangerous and can only be done with specialized equipment.

Peter,Elder,petercelder@gmail.com,citizen,Oregon,"To DEQ and Governor Kitzhaber:
I am writing a concerned citizen and resident of Eastern Oregon.  I am also a Professional Land Surveyor and employee of ODOT.  I understand why DEQ is the public agency holding the hearing for the proposed coal terminal on the Columbia River but I am surprised that the Department of Transportation is not also involved.  Through my work I am familiar with ORS Chapter 823 which gives ODOT the authority over the railroads in this state and responsibility to protect the citizens of Oregon from risky practices by the railroads including uncovered loads of coal.
I quote a portion of this chapter below:

      823.009 General powers of department regarding motor carriers and railroads. (1) In addition to the powers and duties now or hereafter transferred to or vested in the Department of Transportation, the department shall represent the customers of any motor carrier or railroad, and the public generally, in all controversies respecting rates, valuations, service and all matters of which the department has jurisdiction regarding motor carriers and railroads. In respect thereof, the department shall make use of its jurisdiction and powers to protect such customers, and the public generally, from unjust and unreasonable exactions and practices and to obtain for them adequate service at fair and reasonable rates.
      (2) The department is vested with power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate every motor carrier and railroad in this state, and to do all things necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction.
      (3) The department may participate in any proceeding before any public officer, commission or body of the United States or any state or other jurisdiction for the purpose of representing the public generally and the customers of the services of any motor carrier or railroad operating or providing service to or within this state.
      (4) The department may make joint investigations, hold joint hearings within or without this state and issue concurrent orders in conjunction or concurrence with any official, board, commission or agency of any state or of the United States. [1995 c.733 Â§15; 1997 c.275 Â§9]

Further parts of the chapter deal with the regulation of hazardous waste and also refer to other statutes including ORS Chapter 825.258, rules for transportation of hazardous material.

I know that Governor Kitzhaber is concerned about the health of our citizens and has recently banned tobacco use from all state office campuses and premises.  Governor, you have the power right now to tell the railroads that they have to cover the loads, no hearing is necessary for that.  The issue of global warming and the hazards to our future generations is an even more critical issue.  It doesn't matter whether the coal is burned here or in China it is a threat to our health and well being and not in the public interest to allow the shipments of coal to be transported for export.

Alden,Moss,aldenmoss5@gmail.com,,Oregon,"The Coyote Island Terminal poses a severe threat to Oregonâ€™s water quality and air quality. The DEQâ€™s analysis appears to take into account only the activities at the terminal. However, the terminal is only one small part of the larger issue at hand regarding coal exports. The DEQ needs to take into account every possible effect on Oregonâ€™s water and air quality. This includes activities upstream from the terminal, at the terminal, in transport, and in use overseas. 
The coal that arrives at the terminals would come by train from Wyoming and Montana. These trains would travel through Oregon along the Columbia River. Coal trains are known to release large amounts of toxic coal dust. While surfactants would reduce the problem, a great deal of dust would still come off of the trains. This dust contains mercury, fine particles and many other substances that are harmful to human health. It contributes to cancer, respiratory problems, heart disease and more. Also, when the coal dust becomes airborne and lands on the ground, it can get washed into waterways during rainstorms. The toxic storm water will harm fish, birds, and everything else that lives in the river, including endangered species. 
At the terminal, there are more risks of environmental contamination. The coal being loaded into barges could produce dust, and some of the coal could accidentally land in the river. This goes without mentioning the possibility of accidents where the apparatus could break and release the toxic coal directly into the Columbia River. The DEQâ€™s analysis needs to take into account these possibilities.
Barges that transport the coal from the terminal to ships pose many more risks. The barges would release coal dust, which would pollute the air and go directly into the river. The barges would also increase traffic along the river, leading to an increased possibility of collisions. If a barge carrying coal were to spill its load into the river, we would have an environmental catastrophe on our hands equivalent to an oil spill. While this wouldnâ€™t take place at the terminal, it still poses a severe threat to water quality in Oregon. 
Oregonâ€™s air quality is under another threat from this proposal: pollution from the coal-fired power plants in Asia will return to us. The Coyote Island Terminal, if constructed, would give China and India cheap sources of very dirty coal, incenting them to burn more coal. China is currently working on efforts to reduce its dependence on coal, but this would reverse those efforts. Statistics show that up to 25% of the air pollution on the West Coast comes from China, a number that is sure to increase if we export coal. 
Many proponents of this proposal state that it will create jobs. However, the number of jobs that would be created by this proposal would be very small. The coal export proposals would also make manufacturing cheaper overseas, promoting outsourcing. All of this would be at the cost of a huge increase in water and air pollution throughout Oregon. Besides, the jobs argument is irrelevant in an environmental investigation. 
These are only a few of the issues related to coal exports. While the Coyote Island Terminal may appear to be a small project, the impacts on Oregonâ€™s air and water quality prove to be huge. This is why I urge you to deny Ambre Energy the air quality, water quality, and storm water permits!

Roberta,Cade,robertaanne1@gmail.com,none,OR,"We know that coal is toxic in several ways and the DEQ needs to stop its toxic pollution.  

Coal dust from trains and terminals will pollute our river and our lungs.

The narrow focus of looking at one small part of the coal export project, the coal storage building at Port of Morrow, is short sighted as coal trains will spill toxic dust along their route too.

Coal dust, along with increased barge activity will harm salmon. 

Air and water impacts on all the other terminals, not just at Port Morrow, will harm us.  

And, Ambre Energy's credibility to date is not to be trusted.  They've been shown to lie to government officials.   

DEQ can require more - for instance, the impacts on water quality from the entire coal project.  I suspect Ambre's ability to comply with Oregonâ€™s water quality standards would not pass.  

The Oregon Department of State Lands make the prudent decision to require the full analysis of impacts before issuing any permits, so why is DEQ going forward?

So, the DEQ must notify Ambre that a 401 certification is necessary for their industrial dock and not waive DEQ's authority.

	I want to make it clear that I am adamantly opposed to coal exports because of my concerns about the impacts on this beautiful blue-green planet which we all--even Ambre Energy--inhabit. I urge Governor Kitzhaber to deny the permit for the Coyote Island Terminal coal export project.

	Today we face nothing less than a global crisis: climate disruption and an end to life on Earth as we have known it--all at the hands of the fossil fuel industry which is driven by unprecedented greed and short-sighted delusion.
	Bill McKibben and his friends at 350.org have shown us the math: the nations of the world agreed that a 2 degree rise in the Earthâ€™s average temperature is an upper limit in order to sustain life as we know it.  Burning 565 billion tons of carbon will cause a 2 degree rise in temperatures.  The current reserves of the fossil fuel industry equal 2,795 billion tons of carbon--five times the amount that will doom us to unacceptable temperatures and climate disaster.
	Right now we are experiencing record-setting droughts, wild fires, polar and glacier melting, and extreme weather (exemplified by hurricane Sandy).  If ever we have received a wake up call, this is it.  I strongly recommend that everyone see the new documentary movie Chasing Ice by James Balog.  It shows dramatic time-lapse footage of glaciers melting away before our eyes, emphasizing the foolishness of continuing to deny that climate change is occurring.
	We currently have all the scientific and technical knowledge and the physical resources to get all of the energy we need from renewables, according to Mark Z. Jacobson, Director of the Atmosphere/Energy Program and Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University.  Feed-in-tariffs--which have helped put Germany and Ontario, Canada at the forefront of the transition to green energy--are promoted by Oregonians for Renewable Energy Policy (OREP) as an important policy tool to incentivize this transition. 
	Americaâ€™s path to prosperity lies in a rapid switch-over to abundant, homegrown, renewable energy to power our homes, businesses, and vehicles--NOT in facilitating mining and exporting of dirty, polluting coal, which represents a retreat from the 21st Century economy.  Renewable energy already employs 2.7 million workers (more than the fossil fuel industry) and studies have shown that green energy will continue to create far more jobs than the fossil fuel industries.  [see: Sizing the Clean Economy, A National and Regional Green Jobs Assessment by the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institute, 2011.]  A U.S.-led, green, industrial revolution will move our economy forward, create millions of new jobs, and help ensure a livable planet for future generations.
	Global climate change is here. Future generations are watching to see what actions we take to reverse it.

I sit today on a hill above the Columbia River, in the middle of a place so special it is protected as a National Scenic Area, thinking of the legacy of generations who worked to protect this resource for me to enjoy.

My three boys are the 9th generation in my family to be born in the Columbia Gorge. So I write to you today as someone who not only understands the decades of change and development of this river resource, but feels deeply tied to this place on our Earth. My ancestors were some of the first pioneers to settle Â in this place. I can not speak for the land back farther than that, but I can speak for those nine generations of pioneers: hard-working, forward-thinking, optimistic people they must have been. To travel, mostly by foot, across the entire continent in order to start a new life was not a short-term thinking thing to do. They knew there was a real possibility that they would make the trek, put in years of hard labor, and never see personal results.

What would these pioneering people think about us? The change that has come that allows one generation to make choices which promote short-term gain for a few and long-term negative impacts for the generations to come must be unfathomable to them.

We must return to our pioneering roots. To the ways of our Native Elders who teach that any action must not be done unless the impacts of said action for seven generations are considered first.

Now is the time and we are the pioneering people to say no to the short term gain of jobs and cheap energy and to instead forge a new way forward. A way that protects the water, the food supply, and the very climate in which we survive. There is nothing about this coal terminal which speaks to good environmental quality. There will be coal spills. The air, the water and all of us who live down wind and down stream will live with the results. 

I feel for people in places such as Boardman, Hermiston, Heppner, Echo who suffer from a lack of jobs.  But giving in to short term needs while sacrificing our collective future on this planet is not acceptable.

Will,Simons,washwill@gmail.com,,Oregon,"The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) should deny Air Contaminant Discharge, Water Pollution, and Stormwater Permits at the Port of Morrow as filed by the Australian coal company, Ambre Energy, which intends to build a coal export terminal at that location.
As a resident of La Grande, Oregon, I find it very troubling that a large, international coal company could be transporting eight million tons of coal on open-air coal trains from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana through the rail corridor of Eastern Oregon to the Port of Morrow.  All of this to primarily serve Asian markets.  Presently, the United States exports 13 million tons of coal per year.  Hence, this facility alone would transfer over one half of all current US coal exports â€“ all coming at the cost from communities in Eastern Oregon and other parts of the Inland Northwest.  
The bottom line is that massive and dangerous quantities of coal dust will cover the land and infiltrate into our air and water.  In La Grande, the rail corridor runs right through the center of town passing near homes, schools, and businesses.  Hundreds of pounds of coal dust containing mercury, arsenic, cadmium and other carcinogenic heavy metals will be deposited right in the center of my community.
What makes this especially senseless is that these permits would further entrench a 19th century energy model that continues to endanger the planet instead of transitioning to 21st century green energy and technology.  All of this in order to enrich Ambre Energy, while locally, our communities, and globally, our planet, suffers the ill effects.  To permit this facility would demonstrate short-sighted thinking that, by any definition, does not benefit the people of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest.
Likewise, due to automation of the coal industry, the argument that this project would produce lots of living wage jobs and local tax revenues is false.  In fact, there would be more jobs and economic strength by working towards reliable sources of alternative energy rather than the dirty energy of coal.
This is an argument for the public good:  for the good of the people of La Grande; for the good of the people Oregon; for the good of the planet.  Oregon has always had a strong tradition of supporting the public good --the wise stewardship of our environment and investing in the health of our communities â€“ over the narrow, short-term profit margins of polluting, outdated industries.

I believe you would deny the permits for a coal terminal if you had a great argument.  Howâ€™s this:  even if coal exports would create a million jobs, the benefit of the jobs would be nothing compared with the economic harm.

1.  The coal trains cross hundreds of salmon bearing streams, and the hopper doors are frequently broken.   Weâ€™ve had to spend billions in salmon recovery.  We canâ€™t afford to spend more.

2.  EPA says for every $1 spent upgrading diesel engines,  weâ€™d save $4 in health care costs.  Weâ€™ve already spent millions upgrading school buses and Tri-Met, but we have a long way to go.  Increasing numbers of old locomotives and marine engines will increase the cost of health care.

3.  Businesses near the tracks will be impacted.  Waterfront businesses will close or lose value.  Waterfront developments will be discontinued.  (If not in Oregon, than certainly in Montana, Idaho, and Washington.)

4. Tens-of-thousands of people living near the tracks will see reduced property values and reduced quality of life.

5.  Increased rail traffic will create a tax burden to build overpasses.

6.  Agriculture will need to compete with coal for rail capacity and coal dust will degrade the quality of their crops.

7.  Climate Change is a public health emergency.   For documentation,  Google â€œClark County, Climate Change and Human Healthâ€&#65533; 

8.  Global Warming is not a threat.  It is already a reality.  Because the planet is warmer, more water evaporates, which leads to some areas being drier, and some wetter.  Heavier rains lead to flooding and washed out roads and bridges.    Nine years ago, ORS said it was in Oregonâ€™s  economic interest to decrease greenhouse gases, not increase them.

9.  Warmer oceans mean stronger storms which cause a great deal of economic harm.

10.  China is a world leader in the manufacture of wind and solar equipment.   Instead of using that equipment themselves, they sell it globally at the expense of jobs in the American wind and solar manufacturing industries.  Coal exports cost American jobs. 

11.  Even if we stopped burning fossil fuels today, the planet will continue to warm for the next 50 years.  Increasing greenhouse gas emissions could soon push us over the tipping point to extreme Climate Change.  Feedback loops were not included in the IPCC forecasts.   There are hundreds of places in the Arctic where the methane plumes are over a kilometer wide.

12.  By 2050, the Willamette River in Portland will be two feet higher at low tide.  Rainstorms will be more severe.    Floods more frequent.

It is our ethical obligation to stop doing what we know will harm us and those we share our environment with, present and future. It is also common sense. Burning coal releases carbon to the atmosphere, whether here or abroad. These effects can not be mitigated, because the purpose of this project is to sell coal for burning.

Re: Comment on Proposed Coyote Terminal LLC permit 
According to Steamship Mutual: Coal carried in bulk can emit methane, a flammable gas...the ability of coal to variously self-heat, emit flammable gases, corrode and deplete oxygen levels has made the ocean transport of this commodity a particularly hazardous exercise.
According to Geometrica Inc., builder of coal storage facilities: coal dust is highly combustible and an explosion hazard. If a coal dust cloud is generated inside an enclosed space, and an ignition source is present, an explosion can ensueâ€¦ even a small conflagration can result in a catastrophic â€œsecondaryâ€&#65533; explosion if the small event releases a much larger dust cloud. 
In short, we have to take coal as a safety and a potential environmental catastrophe seriously, very seriously.  Apparently, DEQ requires barges that transport petroleum to have spill contingency plans on file with the Emergency Response section - no mention is made of any required contingency plans for the Coyote Island export proposal.  Why not?
Covered coal barges are new, novel, untested - google it and the only reference that returns is this proposed Coyote Island project.  While ocean going ships do carry coal, strict procedures have to been followed to prevent methane and dust accumulations that create explosive conditions.  The barges in the Coyote Island operation will be loading and unloading with a far greater frequency than trans oceanic ships, and be passing through populated areas.
In the end, safeguards are only as good as the integrity of the company responsible for them.  How good a job will the company behind Coyote Island Terminal project?
Ambre Energyâ€™s concealment of its true export intentions at Longview have been documented.  Even Cloud Peak, a business partner and co-owner with Ambre of the Decker Mine has accused Ambre of â€œvarious self-dealing transactionsâ€&#65533; which included this proposed Morrow-Pacific project.
And while Ambre attempts to buy out the Decker mine from Cloud Peak, they are unable to come up with the $70 million in cash to close this deal.  

Given their track record and shaky financial footing, can we count on Ambre energy not to cut corners on safety and environmental protection?

Air and Water Permits need to account for all the possible dangers an operation presents including catastrophic failure, even those which may be statistically rare (which is which the banking industry said about the dangers of hedge funds going bad).  We have to be prepared for the worst scenario; to do so is not giving Oregonians the protections they deserve.

The proposed project will bring countless train loads of coal through the Umatilla Indian Reservation, downtown Pendleton and within 100 yards of our home. Coal dust and diesel pollution are my primary concerns. Coal dust is an environmental contaminate that can settle on water, soil or vegetation.

James,Emerson,opecheelake@hotmail.com,,Oregon,"The Coyote Island Terminal permits should be denied.  With respect to the aspects of this proposal which are within DEQ's official purvue, I am especially concerned about effects on water quality both locally and downriver. I grew up in New England in the 1950's and saw firsthand how pervasive coal dust is in every aspect of its transport and handling  - and that was with hard anthracite coal. I don't believe that Ambre Energy's proposal, despite use and despoilation of large quantities of water, will prevent coal dust and effleunt from polluting the air and the water. I do not believe that employees in the transfer facility will have a non-toxic  work environment., either. Are there any examples of facilities like this one, anywhere else in the world, from which actual experience can be drawn to compare to the claims of the applicants?  Think about this: if the ""treated"" (dampened) dust was as little as one-tenth of one percent of the coal, by weight; and the ""water treatment"" process was as much as 99.9% effective; there would still be 8.8 tons of pure coal in effluent form, per year, entering the environment at Morrow ! (Based on the stated export tonnage.) 
And these percentages are highly optimistic. 
If DEQ seeks independent evidence based on other operations, I believe this permit will be found to be non-compliant for air quality, water quality, and storm-water quality. A decision for DENIAL wll follow.
I know it is outside your official purvue to rule upon the climate effects, rail traffic effects, and financial aspects of this proposal, but I can't avoid urging you as fellow residents on this little planet to be very skeptical of proposals by fossil-fuel-exploiting companies seeking to profit while the future of our civilization is imperiled. To say that the rules of today's ""game"" force us to wear blinders to the interrelated and urgent aspects of this project, when thinking people should be forcing reconsideration at every possible turn, will not be a good enough excuse 80 or 100 years from now.

I recently moved to Morrow County from Salem to take the position of CEO with the Morrow County Health District.  Coming from the Willamette Valley to North Eastern Oregon has been quite an eye opener. 

The quality of life in Morrow County is outstanding, but many of the young people who grow up here are forced to leave and live elsewhere because of the scarcity of employment opportunities.

However, it's my understanding that this project meets or exceeds Oregonâ€™s high standards for protecting the environment and is designed to minimize dust and spillage.

Testimony of Alice Shapiro         July 9, 2013  RE:  DEQ permits for Ambre Energy
A major reason I am opposed to coal exports and to the proposed shipping to Port of Morrow is aboveâ€”a picture of my three beautiful and precious granddaughters.  Consideration for their health and safety should be enough motivation to protect our environment and I am angry that so many innocents have no voice in their future.  I am not going to take the time to elucidate all of the health risks involved in the mining, transporting and use of coalâ€”you have heard those arguments many times and I have included some in this written testimony.  I will say in the brief time allotted to me this evening that I am angry and disappointed in the actions (or should I say inactions) of the Department of Environmental Quality.  A couple of reasons follow:
â€¢	You are defining the permits in a very narrow scope, considering only the air quality and stormwater impacts at the Port of Morrow.  We know that the risks begin at the point of extraction and continue to the destination somewhere in Asia, with health impacts that never disappear.  You say that this is out of your scope and I wish to remind you that as a government agency, you work for me and all of the people of the United States, not for Ambre Energy or any other large corporation.  We are your scope!
â€¢	You did not allow a large enough venue tonight for the public to truly hear the testimony.  I believe we deserve a broader scope than this, just as your permit considerations require a broader scope.  I urge you to truly protect the quality of our environment.  I am closing my spoken testimony now and will rejoin the Peopleâ€™s Hearing outside.   More written testimony follows, for the record.
I oppose coal exports for many reasons, and primarily to protect the health of my grandchildren and all grandchildren.  I am a community college professor in the health professions field and I have also worked in the health professions.  I have great concerns regarding the potential for coal to spill from barges, shipping, and transfer locations into the Columbia and of coal dust spewing from uncovered trains travelling the Columbia Gorge.  The mercury, arsenic, lead and other heavy metals contained in coal will enter the food chain, water and air and will certainly affect our health adversely.  And, we have seen the effects of climate change already with the CO2 parts per million up to 400.  The continuing use of coal will exacerbate this problem.  I urge you to stop turning a deaf ear to my concerns and the concerns of thousands of other residents of the Pacific Northwest and countless people throughout the globe.  I urge you and Director Dick Pedersen and Governor Kitzhaber to do everything possible to protect Oregonians (and others) from filthy coal pollution.  Deny these permitsâ€”it is the right thing to do and the only intelligent thing to do.

James,Powers,jp@ccpvideos.com,Citizen,Oregon,"I write to you today as a multi-generational Oregon resident, parent and grandparent.  When our children are born we hold them in our arms and tell them we love them and will keep them safe from harm.  I have three children: Kyna, Ben & Kelly and two grandchildren, 1-year-old Maxwell and 2 month old Audrey.  By mid-century my children will be my age and my grandchildren will be about 40.  In 2100 they will be 87 & 88.  We all live in Oregon and share the biosphere that will be damaged if the permits you are considering today are issued and the coal flows through this Coyote Island Terminal.

The Oregon DEQ states its purpose as protecting the quality of Oregonâ€™s environmentâ€&#65533;...and being a leader in restoring, maintaining & enhancing the quality of Oregonâ€™s air, land & water...for a healthy, sustainable environment.â€&#65533;    

If you are to live up to your mission statement you must look beyond the narrow scope you have imposed on yourselves and consider the environmental harm the operation of this terminal will have on Oregonians.

CO2 is a harmful greenhouse gas pollutant and major cause of global climate instability.

This terminal is like a CO2 valve.  Once turned on the applicant proposes to push nearly 16 Million tons   of CO2 through it, annually, and release it into the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.  There it will remain for hundreds of years and damage the quality of life for all of our children and grandchildren and beyond.

In addition to the damage from climate instability it will also release lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and ozone into the trade winds  that blow back to Oregon. As you know, high mercury levels have been measured on our own Mt Bachelor Observatory coming from Asian coal fired power plants.

In its Social Cost of Carbon tables the Environmental Protection Agency has quantified the economic cost of the harm the proposed Coyote Island Terminal â€œvalveâ€&#65533; will cause to us.  Using their tables the social cost of burning 8.8 million tons / of coal could be $3 million per day ($1.1 billion per year) in 2015, growing to $6 millionâ€¦per day ($2.2 billion / year) by 2050.  Other scientists have estimated these costs 200% higher.  

You say your mandate is limited to the safety of the air and water immediately adjacent to the property being proposed and that you have no personal responsibility for the greater harm nearly everyone here agrees this project will enable.  In my view this is as responsible as a parent checking the safety belt of his teenager as he sends him off to a weekend party with a case of Jim Beam riding shotgun.

If, your conscience discerns that this coal terminal will â€œenhance the quality of Oregonâ€™s air, land & waterâ€&#65533; and protect your children and grandchildren and my children and grandchildren from harm then you should approve it.

Otherwise you should deny these permits, demand a broader mandate or resign in protest.

Kevin,Weitemier,kweitemier@gmail.com,Native Plant Society of Oregon,Oregon,"The Native Plant Society of Oregon would like to ensure that the impacts of Ambre Energy's proposed Morrow Pacific Project, the Coyote Island Terminal LLC coal export project, and increased coal transport along the length of these routes are considered in a full Environmental Impact Statement, with particular attention paid to the impact on vegetation communities, particularly in the Columbia River Gorge. This Environmental Impact Statement should be completed before the issuing of any permits is considered.

Coal dust has been shown to have several significant effects on both abiotic conditions and floral communities in eastern Oregon ecosystems. Specifically, deposition of coal dust has been shown to significantly increase soil temperature, lower pH, and alter soil moisture regimes. Additionally, there are indications of increased levels of iron, copper, zinc, sulfates, and lead on soils with dust accumulation (Spencer 1997, 2001).

Deposition of coal dust has been shown to alter floral communities: Lichen communities are significantly altered and many species, including those that fix nitrogen, are significantly less frequent on soils with coal dust relative to those without. An increase in the moss Ceratodon purpureus on soils with coal dust suggests that increased levels of metals in the soil may be driving vegetation change. Coal dust depositions may be altering vascular plant phenology. Communities with coal dust exhibited earlier germination and flowering of annuals and some perennials, and communities with dust tended to have a lower biomass of native perennials (Spencer 1997, 2001).

Finally, if coal trains increase the risk of train-caused fires, the impacts of these fires on local vegetation must be assessed.

While these effects should be considered for all vegetation along the coal routes and in the Columbia River Gorge, it is particularly important for rare plants in the Gorge including, but not limited to: Penstemon barrettiae, Sullivantia oregana, Cimicifuga elata, Ranunculus recondis, Agrostis howellii, Rotala ramosior, Fritillaria camschatcensis, Corydalis aquae-gelidae, Carex macrochaeta, Erigeron howellii, and Artemisia campestris var. wormskioldii.

To whom it may concern:



On 25January2012 Columbia County was offered a look at Amber Energyâ€™s proposal to ship coal via barge from Gillette Wyomingâ€™s â€œPowder Riverâ€&#65533; mine.  The coal will be reloaded from rail to barge in Morrow County, barged to Clatskanie in Columbia County where it will be reloaded using a large auger, (dubbed  â€œThe Enclosed Transloaderâ€&#65533;) directly to ship to markets in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 

Amberâ€™s proposal is to build 20 custom  covered barges, 42â€™ x 275â€™ for use  in groups of 4. The Enclosed Transloader goes over the barges and pumps directly into the waiting ship. 

Among others at that meeting, Dan Kaufman, President of the Longshoremanâ€™s Union talked about good family wage jobs, both construction and long term. 

Columbia County desperately needs new jobs like those offered by Morrow Pacific.  Weâ€™ve suffered the loss of large employers Trojan Nuclear and Boise Cascade Paper Industries recently and have been looking for new opportunities like this.

 The dynamo that is Asian manufacturing will be using coal to power their insatiable appetite far into the future, especially in light of the nuclear disaster Japan had  in 2011.  

â€œPowder Riverâ€&#65533; coal with its low toxicity is a preferred coal as opposed to high mercury, sulfur, and arsenic coal  the entire Pacific Rim is currently forced to use as its all they have access to. Even the EPA says trace elements are making their way into the food chain.

To summarize:  

1. Good for the Pacific Rim air and water sheds. 
2. Offers excellent job creation.  Every Morrow Pacific job will create 3 auxiliary  jobs in support. 
3.  Large tax contributors.
4. Project will meet or exceed Oregonâ€™s stringent environmental standards.

As a 30 year business owner and  employer in Columbia County I offer my unqualified support for the Morrow-Pacific project.

Caitlin,Shelman,Caitlin.shelman@gmail.com,,Oregon,"This is my testimony from today's hearing:

I am a teacher, so I, like you, am a public servant.  This means I work for the public.  I'm here to remind you that you work for us, Not for Ambre energy.  

Since I keep hearing that it is not within your agency's jurisdiction to look at the broader implications of this coal export project, I decided to investigate your job description. I began to wonder whose job it really is to protect Oregon's environment.

I found the answer pretty quickly.  This is from your website:

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is a regulatory agency whose job is to protect the quality of Oregon's environment.

DEQ is responsible for protecting and enhancing Oregon's water and air quality, for cleaning up spills and releases of hazardous materials, for managing the proper disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, and for enforcing Oregon's environmental laws. 
 
You have a current agreement with the EPA, in which the EPA is charged with:

-Working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and develop adaptation strategies to address climate change in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Alaska.
-Providing scientific data on projected climate change impacts to inform decisions that will help reduce infrastructure vulnerability, build ecosystem resilience, and protect and restore critical ecological functions, as well as identify opportunities for reducing GHG emissions.

Your joint agreement with the EPA goes on to explain that:

Greenhouse gases contribute to climate change, which is expected to have serious impacts in Oregon including coastal and river flooding, snow pack declines, lower summer river flows, reduction of farm and forest productivity, energy cost increases, public health effects, and increased pressures on many fish and wildlife species. 

If your stated goal is to work to combat climate change, and permitting this project clearly is in direct violation of your goal, then you need to be working furiously to change Oregon laws, or interpret them in a way that allows you to block this project.

There are countless times that your website mentions how DEQ has worked to expand and revise regulations.  It seems like this would be an ideal opportunity to do just that. After all, this rush by companies to make a quick buck by using the Pacific Northwest to excrete America's unwanted fossil fuels is something we've not seen on this scale.  New regulations seem to be in order.

I challenge you to reread your job description, remind yourselves of who you really work for, and get to work to improve, rather than harm, Oregon's environment through this process.

Leslie,March,lesliemarch@hotmail.com,Ms.,Oregon,"As the fifth generation of my family to live near the Columbia Gorge, I am concerned about the proposed coal export facility. According to Heavy Traffic ahead, a report commissioned by the Western Organization of Resource Councils (WORC), up to 60 unit trains a day, full and empty, to and from the West Coast would be required to transport the proposed 170 million tons of coal a year through the Northwest.. This coal would then be shipped on to Asian markets. In Eastern Oregon, coal trains currently bring about 2.1 million tons of coal per year to supply the Boardman power plant. Australian company, Ambre Energy, is now proposing to export over 8 million tons of coal per year through Port of Morrow at full capacity. This would quadruple current coal train traffic through communities and on grain shipping routes up and down the Columbia River.
This increased traffic will result in increased emissions through out the gorge as trains and cars will be forced to idl as they wait their turn on the already   overburdened route.  The tracks do not have the capacity to run this many additional trains efficiently.  
The export depot operators claim that there will not be any debris or particles of coal in the air but this is contrary to studies and reports of coal trains in other parts of our country.  Coal particulates have been found to be a major cause of childhood asthma. Are we inviting additional health risks to the Columbia Gorge and the communities along the tracks? 
I am in opposition to the approval of the export terminal due to environmental and health concerns.  I am also opposed to the over burden of our track system, the traffic snafus that will be caused and the potential that Northwest products will not be able to get to market because of competition for rail time that will happen due to the physical limitations of how many trains can go through safely in a day.  Please deny these permits.",Air Quality Permit,
Diana,Gordon,tndgardens@comcast.net,,WA,"Washingtonians are concerned about the problems relating to the operation of the new Coyote Island Terminal LLC coal export project, too.  As a member of the Washougal Parks Board, I am especially interested in the problem of water quality.  Water-based recreation is a mainstay of the Gorge and I am very much against any activity that could have a negative impact on it.  

Shipping huge open trainloads of coal across a windy and sometimes rainy expanse of river can only contribute to water pollution.  DEQ can say that they only deal with onsite pollution, but the rest of us are left dealing with the pollution caused solely by shipments of coal to this facility.  

Ambre's website shows huge futuristic-looking covered warehouses for storing coal.  Has this technology ever been used before?  Are we sure it will work?  Will it avoid all runoff to ground water and the Columbia?  What if they slip up and some of their wastewater reaches the ground water or the river?  We have only to look at the Hanford mess to see the result of unintended consequences and insufficient planning and safeguards.   We do not want Boardman to join the list of sites that need  cleaning up.  In this case, a 401 Certification under the Clean Water Act seems warranted.  It seems like the least we can do.  Denying these permits would be better.  In a situation where the quality of life in this  region could be very heavily affected, we do not want a foreign company to be able to avoid the consequences of an unintended accident.

Nancy,McMath,nancymcmath@yahoo.com,none,Oregon,I wish to go on the record in opposition to permits for Coyote Island Terminal. The business of coal has a global impact that no one on earth can afford. Why would we take such a short sighted approach to energy needs in light of global warming. ,,
Brooke,Jacobson,dbjacob@comcast.net,,OREGON,"
Right now the pressure to provide jobs and boost the economy is powerful.  We are still feeling the effects of the 2008 economic crisis brought on by careless financial speculation.  Ambre Energy and other advocates of expanding global trade by exploiting our natural resourcesâ€”particularly fossil fuelsâ€”promise both jobs and profits.  But while the economy remains a major concern, we face at the same time an even greater challenge of accelerating climate change.

Ambre Energy wants to bring an estimated 52 million tons of coal from their open pit mines in Utah by rail to Columbia River ports of Morrow and Westwood.
Ambre Energyâ€™s web-site paints a glowing portrait of a highly efficient, clean and safe, multi-tiered operation that integrates production, marketing, and delivery.  In reality, this company, founded in 2005, is one of the highly speculative start-ups that exemplify the risk-laden investment that has undermined our economy.  In short, its promised economic benefits are in question, while its environmental impact has barely begun to be assessed.

Serious questions about the long term environmental and human health impact of transporting coal by rail and barge through the northwest region need to be answered.  We need specific answers to the effects of the toxic coal dust on our air and water.  We need specific answers as to the impact on salmon spawning grounds and fisheries.  We need to know how the increased toxicity of air and water will affect human populations, and the long-term costs of dealing with asthma and other afflictions associated with breathing toxic coal dust.

Beyond these concerns, there is the much larger question of how we can reduce carbon emissions if we continue to enable the spread of fossil fuel consumption around the world.  Will we allow these wildly speculative coal export projects aimed at wringing the last profits out of fossil fuel, or will we acknowledge the real situation posed by climate change and take the necessary steps to make life on this planet sustainable?

There are several public crossings of the BNSF line where the trains are at a speed of approximately 55 mph or more.

Howard,Shapiro,howeird3@gmail.com,Sierra Club,OR,"I am on record as being against the shipping of U.S. coal from the Port of Morrow to China, Korea and other Asian countries.  The trade winds and currents move the poisonous exhaust from the spent coal across the Pacific Ocean back to our shores and further.
With our atmosphere recently recorded as having 400ppm of carbon we cannot afford to continue encouraging the use of fossil fuels.  Coal and petroleum are the fuels that contribute a large portion of carbon to the air that we breathe and the water that we drink.  The toxic Mercury, Lead, Arsenic, Zinc etc. that these fumes contain are poisonous to us and our food sources.
I realize that you are charged with making sure that industry meets the letter of the standards set by law to make our atmosphere relatively safe.  However your name implies that you are also safeguarding our quality of life and health is a very important factor in quality of life.  
The Governor of our state and one of our Senators has called for an area wide environmental impact report from the mine to the shipping port.  Yet your department insists on taking a narrow view of the environmental impacts of shipping coal from our state.  This tunnel vision will cause much degradation to the state in which you are supposedly doing your job and its residents.  
In my opinion your first consideration should be to the people and the government of the state that you should be serving and not to the bottom line of a near bankrupt Australian corporation which might not be able to afford to complete their proposal.  The few sustainable jobs that this project will generate as compared to the trouble that this project may cause in our state must be considered in your decision.
The technique of shipping coal in covered barges, to my knowledge as a result of my research, has not been done before.   Has there been a prototype or even a scale model to see if the theory will work?   Or are you taking the word of a near bankrupt company that it will work?  What will be done if a barge catches fire or becomes derelict in the river and begins to sink while loaded with toxic coal?  I hope, for the sake of Oregonians, this eventuality has been considered.   For the good of Oregonians, as many potentially harmful contingencies as possible should be considered before granting any permits.  I guess Iâ€™m too late because you have already carelessly granted a conditional permit.

David,Perk,davidperk@comcast.net,,Washington,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed Coyote Island Terminal coal export facility. From your well-written web page I can see that you would prefer comments to be directly related to the scope of permitting, e.g., air quality, water quality and storm run off.

Please add my comment to the list of those opposed to the terminal on the grounds of climate change.

Like Governor Kitzhaber, I believe that the review process must cover a wider scope. In the absence of another forum I will contribute my opinion to your agency in the hope that you, in turn, will emphasize to federal agencies the need for a wider review.

President Obama's criteria for the Keystone XL pipeline, that it ""serve the national interest,"" should be applied to the proposed Coyote Island terminal. This should include a full cost and benefit accounting. Is the price of the raw material being subsidized by taxpayers? Are we getting a fair price? Does that price reflect the immediate and long term effects of the consumption of the material? 

Those proposing the Coyote Island terminal could meet every environmental regulation, they could provide many living-wage jobs, they could share the Columbia with other shipping, they could migitate every spill; they could do all those things and still be on the wrong side of the climate change equation simply due to the additional carbon their business will put into our planet's atmosphere and oceans.

America needs to price carbon pollution. It is my personal belief that once fairly priced, coal will not be worth taking out of the ground. But that is a question that should be answered by the marketplace in response to a wider review and appropriate, comprehensive price-setting and regulation.

The impacts of carbon pollution are well known and the science is not in dispute from any reputable party. Our government has been irresponsible for many years in not addressing carbon pollution effectively. Our lack of action will forever discredit us to future generations. It is time to change that.

Stanley,Niemiec,joynter@wvi.com,Concerned Private Citizen and Human Being,Oregon,"With regard to the initial Air Contaminant Discharge Permit Application submitted to Oregon DEQ for the Coyote Island Terminal LLC located at the Port of Morrow, Mr. Clark Mosley, President and CEO., endorsed the following statement:

		I hereby apply for permission to discharge air contaminants in the State of Oregon, as stated or described in this application, and certify that the information contained in this application and the schedules and exhibits appended hereto, are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Included in those appended schedules and exhibits are Tables 2 and 6 which indicates a site wind speed of 4 mph; and Tables 3, 4, and 5 that indicate a site wind speed of 2 mph.  These wind speed values were used to calculate the estimated amounts of discharged materials.

In my criticism of this initial Permit Application, my limited research, based on the basic characteristic of the Columbia River Gorge, that average wind speeds were significantly greater.  Based on information I obtained from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), their Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the US indicated Boardmanâ€™s average wind power indicated a wind speed range between 11.5 and 12.5 mph.

Oregon DEQ had another source of information, (a PGE Wind Speed Study) that indicated that the siteâ€™s average wind speed was 25.3 mph.

It is my assertion and allegation that Mr.  Clark Mosley purposely and intentionally misrepresented the siteâ€™s average wind speeds in the initial application he endorsed and submitted so that discharge volumes would be grossly under-estimated.  The information contained in (his) application was not true and correct; and anyone with the most basic knowledge of the site and the Columbia River Gorge area would know that the wind speed information was false.  As such, it is, for all practical purposes, to conclude that Mr.  Clark Mosley committed perjury.  

An individual perjures oneself by swearing falsely or of willfully making a false statement under oath or solemn affirmation in some legal inquiry.

It is my contention that the Air Contaminant Discharge Permit Application should be summarily rejected on this basis alone.  Given that the Application contains one example of readily discernible grossly false information, it is certainly conceivable that the Application contains other examples of false or misrepresented information (especially errors of omission).

It is astounding to me that Oregon DEQ would give tentative approval to the Permit Application given this fundamental situation (apparently allowing and condoning with impunity the submission of false and misleading permit applications.

Worse is a situation that I find completely incomprehensible  -- that being Oregon DEQâ€™s use of data from the Application that completely accepts the assertions that there will be ZERO discharge of hazardous contaminants from rail cars entering the site (prior to unloading), from rail cars subsequent to unloading (that they will be cleaned of particulates at a seven sigma level [i.e. seven standard deviations], from hundreds upon hundreds of linear feet of conveyors, and/or from three storage buildings (both initially when constructed or after numerous years of moving and storing during Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively 3.85 and 8.8 million tons of coal).  Zero discharge of hazardous contaminants in not only incomprehensible, it is fundamentally unbelievable; AND IS ESPECIALLY SO GIVEN THE INDICATED FALSIFICATION OF OTHER INFORMATION WITHIN THE APPLICATION.

Only by ignoring the objective and real discharge from these locations and equipment is it possible for the Oregon DEQ to calculate estimated values of hazardous discharge that is somehow within â€œallowableâ€&#65533; limits can Oregon DEQ approve this permit.  

This coal transfer facility is a filthy, hazardous mess that will permanently poison this site and that will eventually cause long term degradation of water quality and fisheries habitat in the Columbia River.  And given the potential for a catastrophic accident similar to the recent railroad event in Eastern Quebec or the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, where in the Application and Tentative Approval documents are such risks and potential devastations being evaluated.

Coyote Island Coal Terminal Permits.

Submitted by: Leonard Higgins, 4129 NW Peppertree Pl, Corvallis OR 97330.

My name is Leonard Higgins. I was born in Eugene and have lived in Oregon throughout my life.Â Â I love Oregon's natural beauty and the independence of its citizens and leaders.

I'm here today to appeal to management and staff of the Oregon DEQ and regional EPA offices to do the right thing for Oregon and the region. I know you may feel you are doing everything you can to protect us from health and climate impacts. I've heard that you are limited to consideration of only the technical details of this one permit for the Coyote Island Terminal. If Ambre Energy is able to show they are meeting the technical requirements within the scope of narrow site-specific regulations, DEQ appears to be on a track to grant this permit.

Please lift your sights out of the regulations and look instead at the mission of the DEQ, look at the spirit of the DEQ Performance Partnership Agreement with the EPA, look at the mission of the EPA, look at guidance from the President's Council on Environmental Quality; look at pleas from Governors Kitzhaber and Inslee, and look at the letter from Kate Kelly, a Regional EPA Director, to the Army Corp of Engineers. It seems so obvious that this permit cannot be issued without considering the regional impacts in conjunction with over a dozen other active proposals for rail, shipping, pipeline and terminals to transport fossil fuels through the northwest. Please look at the May 2013 report from Sightline Institute titled ""Northwest Fossil Fuel Exports"" for more information about the range of infrastructure projects that are poised to turn the Pacific Northwest into an export hub threatening our health and the global climate.

For those of you whose decisions are governed primarily by economics, I submit to you that the costs of these projects to citizens of Oregon and the regionÂ will far outweigh any economic benefits to Oregon and the region. The costs of these projects include:
Â - the public share of needed transportation infrastructure improvements,
Â - dampening impacts on regional tourism,Â 
Â - increased competition for transportation across public right-of-ways,
Â - impacts on health,
Â - emergency response to extreme weather,
Â - increased size and frequency of wild fires, and the
Â - impacts of climate change on crops and water availability.
The primary economic benefit is to provide expanded markets and increased profits to individuals and corporations outside of the Pacific Northwest.

For those of you whose decisions are governed primarily by asking what is the right thing to do, I'm asking you to do the right thing for Oregon, the region, and its citizens. And, I'm asking you to consider the impacts of approving these projects, one after another, on your family and friends. For those of you with grandchildren, like myself, will be able to tell them you did everything you could to protect their future?

claudia,keith,ca.keith@comcast.net,individual,oregon,"As a very concerned Oregon citizen I implore you to be  responsible representive for the people. Here are some recommended concerns and questions.

1. Coal is toxic and DEQ should stop toxic pollution. DEQ should not allow coal dust from
trains and terminals to pollute our river and our lungs.
2. It is foolish for DEQ to only look at one small part of the coal export project â€“ the coal
storage site at the Port of Morrow.
a. What about the uncovered coal trains spilling coal dust in the Columbia River?
b. Or a new coal dock at Port of Morrow that would harm salmon?
c. Or the impact of a huge increase in barging on the Columbia?
d. Or the air and water impacts of the OTHER coal terminal where Ambre would
transfer coal from barges to ships? This terminal is proposed in a salmon nursery
219 miles downstream from the Port of Morrow at Port Westward.
e. Or the impacts of new coal barges on the Columbia Gorge Scenic Area or coal
ships on the Columbia River Estuary?
3. Instead of putting on blinders and ignoring the full impacts, DEQ should require a
Clean Water Act 401 certification to consider all of the impacts of Ambreâ€™s coal â€“ from
the trains to the ships.
a. DEQ can require a Clean Water Act section 401 certification to look at the water
quality impacts of the entire coal project â€“ from train to ship.
i. Under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, DEQ can evaluate whether
Ambreâ€™s entire project complies with Oregonâ€™s water quality standards.
DEQ can consider the impacts of coal dust, barges, a new dock, and ships
on salmon and other river life.
b. DEQ should notify Ambre immediately that a 401 certification is necessary for
their industrial dock at the Port of Morrow.
c. It is unacceptable for DEQ to give Ambre a free pass by waiving its 401 authority
i. Doesnâ€™t DEQ want to know the full impacts?
ii. Why would DEQ waive its right to conduct a 401 certification and protect
the Columbia River from dirty coal?
4. Without 401 certification, there are large gaps in government review.
a. Ask DEQ: Who is going to check if the coal barges will harm the Columbia River?
The Army Corps will not review, and responding to spills is not enough.
b. Ask DEQ: Who is going to evaluate the impact of coal ships and barges in the
salmon nursery at Port Westward?
5. Oregon should not piecemeal coal permits.
a. The Oregon Department of State Lands made the prudent decision to require the
full analysis of impacts before issuing any permits.
i. Why is DEQ plowing ahead?
ii. The State should act in a coordinated manner.
6. Air permit â€“ DEQ should deny the air discharge permit because Ambreâ€™s coal terminal
and tugs will violate Oregonâ€™s air quality standards.
a. DEQ has no experience reviewing a coal export terminal. DEQ should wait for
the full federal analysis.
b. DEQ should evaluate the air impacts from the Port Westward end of the project.
Why look at only half of the project?
7. Reputation â€“ Ambre has a bad history of lying to public officials and DEQ should not
trust Ambre.
a. Ambre lied to the State of Washington and Cowlitz County about the size of a
project in Longview, purposefully getting permits for a 5 million ton per year coal
export facility while secretly planning 60 million tons per year.
b. DEQ should ask hard questions, not waive its authority.
Suggested Questions
Ambre promises the moon. But the company has no track record of operating a coal export
terminal and is on shaky financial ground.1 We should ask DEQ how it would protect Oregonians

an inexperienced corporation that has never operated a coal export terminal.

Most importantly, man made Global Warming is real and we must make hard decisions based on science to reduce Co2 from 400ppm back to 350ppm. Our children and grandchildren are at risk, we must address the long vision of what is needed to return to a healthy planet eco system.

Janet,Alderton,jmalderton@yahoo.com,,Washington,"The State of Oregon should use its broad authority to coordinate a review of the full impacts of Ambre Energyâ€™s proposed coal export scheme that will transport uncovered coal by rail from mines in Montana and Wyoming to Boardman, Oregon. At Boardman, the coal would be transferred to barges that would be towed 219 miles along the majestic Columbia River to the Port of Morrow. At Morrow, the coal would again be transferred, to storage and then to ocean going ships for export to Asia. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) should require a Clean Water Act Section 401 certification that evaluates the water quality impacts of the entire coal transit from trains to ocean-going ships. In addition to fugitive coal dust, fuel spills from tugs and coal ships threaten salmon fisheries. Because Oregonâ€™s air quality standards would be violated by Ambre Energyâ€™s coal terminal and tugs, the DEQ should deny the required air discharge permit. The Oregon Department of State Lands has decided to require a full analysis of impacts before it decides to issue any permits. DEQ should do the same. The potential loss of jobs due to declines in fishing, declines in tourism, and declines in the quality of life and human health along the coal transport corridor outweigh any temporary bump in construction jobs and the relatively small number of permanent jobs. The impacts to the salmon nursery at Port Westward should be considered before granting permits to Ambre Energy. Coal export through Oregon benefits the corporate bottom line of Ambre Energy who has a history of lying to public officials. Ambre was granted permits for a 5 million ton per year export facility at Longview, Washington while secretly planning expansion to 60 million tons of coal per year. Ambre Energy eventually withdrew from the Longview coal export project and has no experience operating a coal export terminal. Ambre Energyâ€™s finances are suspect. How would Ambre pay for environmental damages caused by fuel and coal spills or by explosions at the port or at facilities anywhere along the route? The mandate of the DEQ is to protect the air, water, and communities of Oregon. A full analysis of impacts by the DEQ and the Oregon Department of State Lands will conclude that Ambre Energy should not be granted permits to export dirty coal.",General,

Regarding both the air and water quality permits which DEQ has determined are needed by Ambre Energy for its proposed Coyote Island Terminal facility at the Port of Morrow in Boardman, Oregon:

We ask that the scope of the permits be broadened to include a detailed analysis of the potential for suspended
particulates to significantly impact the air quality of the Columbia Basin for extended periods of time.

Large amounts of particulates will be released by uncovered coal cars traveling through the Columbia
Basin many times a day on their way to Boardman. The impact will be especially pronounced during the
winter months.
  
We also ask that the scope of the water discharge permit be expanded to include the impact to water quality from the pulse of particulates which will channel into the Columbia river system when precipitated out of suspension during the storm events which typically mark the end of air inversion episodes in the Basin.

These requests are predicated on the unique climatology of the Basin. That climatology puts the human population of the Basin at health risk. The loading of the airshed with suspended coal dust will continue for weeks at a time during the winter air inversions that are characteristic of the entire basin. Inversions occur when high pressure dominates the region, a regular wintertime occurrence.

Coal dust emissions also put the Columbia River at risk from the rapid accumulation of airborne carbon particulates all of which will fall out of suspension in a short period of time once precipitation sweeps through the inversion layer. This poses serious potential harm to the Columbia River system's vertebrate and invertebrate animal populations.

Additionally, DEQ should include the potential global warming implications of this coal terminal and the burning of that US coal in power plants in other countries.  DEQ is asked to broaden its analysis.  If the State of Oregon cannot do this then DEQ should request the federal agencies conduct such an analysis as part of a comprehensive EIS.  Such an EIS should be done prior to the issuance of these permits.",,

Michael,Riordan,mriordan137@gmail.com,Friends of the San Juans,Washington,"As explained in detail in the attached comment, I believe that the air-quality permit application prepared for this project by Golder Associates is deeply flawed and should be rejected, or at least returned for major revisions. The Golder report ignores important sources of fugitive coal dust, for example from railway cars waiting to be unloaded. It also uses extremely optimistic values for the winds speeds and moisture content of the coal; these numbers seem to be intentionally chosen to reduce the amount of fugitive coal dust that arises in the various storage and transfer processes that occur at the proposed Port Morrow terminal. The DEQ should take particular note of the coal losses that occur in the barge-loading process, which seem exceedingly optimistic in this regard, resulting in less than a ton of coal lost per year. If this calculation were done with reasonable assumptions and numbers, the losses in loading would likely be in the dozens of tons of coal per year. Most of these loading losses would find their way into the nearby Columbia River, so they would affect local water quality, too.

Brian,Evert,brian.evert@usfab.com,US Fab,Washington,"I attended the hearing on July 9th to provide my comments in support of the Morrow Pacific Project, and the permit application before the board.  
First, this is NOT a referendum or decision on the use of coal for energy.  
Coal will be mined, transported, and used to provide some of the worldâ€™s energy needs for decades to come.  This commerce WILL happen.  
The issue here is whether or not Oregon and Oregonâ€™s residents will be allowed to participate in and benefit from the jobs that come with this commerce.  
This is all about jobs.  Literally thousands of jobs. Short term jobs for the construction and installation of the equipment and infrastructure, and long term jobs supporting these operations for decades.  These will be good paying family wage jobs with benefits.  
This project will not degrade Oregonâ€™s environment.  It is designed to meet or exceed Oregonâ€™s high standards of environmental quality.  Every step of the process from offloading trains, loading onto covered barges, transporting, and unloading onto ships is accomplished using industry leading technology to minimize dust and eliminate spills.  Indeed bulk material transportation by barge is one of the most energy efficient modes of transportation in the world. 
In fact, this project does meet or exceed Oregonâ€™s environmental quality regulations.  It is the job of the Dept of Environmental Quality to issue permits to projects which meet or exceed these regulations.   We do not need further studies or delays.  
I urge you to consider the project permit application on itâ€™s merits, determine that it does meet the requirements, and issue the permit in a timely manner to allow this project to proceed without delay.

Mark,Rittenbaum,mark.rittenbaum@gbrx.com,The Greenbrier Companies,Oregon,"My name is Mark Rittenbaum; I am Chief Financial Officer at The Greenbrier Companies.  Greenbrier is headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon.  We are a leading supplier of transportation equipment and services to the railroad industry.  We also build Jones Act barges for the marine industry in the United States. Nationally, we employ over 2,400 people in 26 states including almost 800 employees in Oregon, with 450 workers at our Gunderson manufacturing site on NW Front Ave. here in Portland.
Gunderson Marine builds marine vessels, including barges, using state of the art technologies, quality craftsmanship and adherence to the highest safety standards.  As you have heard and will hear from others appearing before you today, Morrow Pacific has signed a letter of intent with our company, Gunderson, for the construction of 15 enclosed barges, valued at nearly $60 million. This project would span two years, and would employ 350 full time workers, with benefits.
I have worked with Greenbrier for over 20 years and this is a particularly important moment in our companyâ€™s history.  We compete in very volatile and aggressive markets for transportation equipment and related services.  Just last year, for example, our Board of Directors rejected a hostile takeover attempt that threatened Greenbrierâ€™s nearly 40 years of existence as an independent, headquarters company in Oregon.  We are forced to compete and prevail in our markets every day.  Our success must be earned through competition, it is not a birthright.
It goes without saying, but it bears repeating: manufacturing jobs are critical to our economy and for over 90 years, predating Greenbrierâ€™s ownership, Gunderson has been a major employer in our state.   Recently we announced that slow order activity in both our marine business and for the intermodal railcars that we build at Gunderson, required us to stand down 260 workers at Gunderson.  These recent employment reductions would have been substantially reduced and largely unnecessary if the DEQ permits were issued and our barge construction work was underway for Ambre Energy.  I can speak for our founder and CEO, Bill Furman, when I say that our complete attention is focused on restoring Gunderson to economic health and full employmentâ€”because what is good for Gunderson is good for Greenbrier and when Greenbrier is performing at its peak, that is good for Oregon.
The commitment of the Ambre Energy to work with local companies like ours and keep jobs in the state maximizes the resulting economic benefits of the Morrow Pacific project for Oregon.  In fact, this project means so much to Greenbrier and Gunderson that over 20 of our employees are here today to show their support for Morrow Pacific.
I understand that there are groups who are opposed to all coal projects, regardless of their merits. I ask everyone here to take a closer look at this specific project. Not only does it put Gunderson to work, but every aspect of Morrow Pacific has been designed to protect the environment.
For example, the enclosed barges that Gunderson will build for the project are one-of-a-kind in the coal export industry. This design will give us a local expertise that we can export from Oregon to the world. Enclosing the product during the barging process is just one example of the extra steps the Morrow Pacific project has taken to ensure that it meets Oregonâ€™s high environmental standards.
We need projects like Morrow Pacific; projects that demonstrate the ability to meet environmental standards and contribute to our local economy. 
I urge DEQ to approve the necessary permits and allow the project to move forward.  Thank you.

The July 26th issue of the St. Johns Review has an article about a Toxic Dump coming to Terminal 4.  I am concerned about what I have read and am wondering why haven't I heard anything about this on the news.

I feel that this is important information that should be shared with every body because it effects more than the St. Johns neighbors and community it effects the environment our wetlands that we have been working hard to preserve.  It is my understanding that the location of this proposed toxic dump will be in the River close to our grain storage facilities, across from Sauvie Island and close to where the Willamette meets the Columbia and mouth of the Multnomah Chanel.

The potential for toxic leakage is enormous and a frightening prospect when you consider all the lives it can effect both human and non-human.  I realize this is part of a proposed plain to clean up the sediment from the Willamette River but why put the Toxic waste where it has the potential to recontaminate the water, air and environment.

Please do your part in investigating and reporting on this so that the people can have a say in what goes on in our own back yards and water systems.

I don't know what to do.  This idea scares me and I want to do my part to come up with a better proposal from what I read there is a lot of potential to harm our wild life, wet lands and the humans that live and work in the area.

There is also recent studies that have looked at Greenland have shown a drastic increase in melt rates from this darkening of the ice layer thus making the ice warmer and melt faster.

I support Governor Kitzhaberâ€™s request for a comprehensive review of the cumulative impacts of the 3 proposed terminals for Oregon and Washington.  The impacts from these projects will be felt far beyond the specific terminal sites.

That said, I do have concerns for this specific project and ask that the following impacts be considered:
1.	The increase in diesel fumes from the locomotives traveling the rail corridor will impact communities as will the errant dust as it settles in the Columbia River and the surrounding landscape.  This is a public health issue as well as an economic issue impacting farmers and tourism.
2.	The impact on endangered fish habitat from spillage and dust escaping rail cars into the Columbia River.
3.	The impact of increased river traffic on recreational fishing, as well as the fishing grounds of indigenous people.
4.	There is a potential for negative economic impact due to vastly increased barge traffic with added encumbrance to other river traffic.
5.	I am concerned for the potential safety hazard created from the combustible nature of Powder River Basin coal, and the proposal for covered transfers and storage.  Coal dust is particularly combustible and has been known to explode in covered conveyors and storage domes.  The practicality of loading covered barges from covered conveyors and then loading from the barge to ships in the same manner exhibits the potential for disaster.
6.	The project permits should not be issued without studying the impacts along the river and at the Clatskanie site as an integral part of the project.

No economic gain could possibly offset the negatives that this project will create for our region, our communities, and our citizens.  Once again, few benefit, but many feel the pain.

My name is Dr. Andy Harris, a physician living in Portland and working at OHSU. [OHSU has no position on this issue.]

The mission of the Oregon DEQ includes drinking water protection.  According to the DEQ website:

â€œSafe drinking water supplies will increasingly depend upon reducing the contamination in the source waters.â€&#65533;

Boardmanâ€™s municipal drinking water supply is located just two miles downstream from the proposed Morrow Pacific coal loading dock.  Drinking water for Boardman comes from a horizontal collector well, which draws water from an unconfined shallow aquifer, which lies, in part, beneath the river.  The aquifer is recharged from the river.  Contaminate one and you contaminate the other.  

What is DEQ doing to assure that the proposed coal terminal will not contaminate Boardmanâ€™s municipal drinking water?  Shouldnâ€™t we be concerned about contamination from construction of the dock, which will stir up toxic sediments?  Has DEQ tested for PCBs, pesticides and radioactive isotopes in the riverbed?  What will be the impact on drinking water from diesel pollution from the barges? Wouldnâ€™t it be prudent to study the health impact of toxic coal dust spilled into the water during the loading of barges?  Is there an alternative drinking water supply should this source be contaminated? 

The citizens of Boardman are at risk.  Since DEQâ€™s mission includes drinking water protection, these issues must be addressed. To look only at air quality, storm water and waste water at the terminal site neglects one of the most important environmental quality issues of all â€“ potential contamination of the municipal drinking water of a city of over 3,000. 

DEQ must not issue any permits to Ambre Energy until a site-specific Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) have been conducted and reviewed.

Norm,Cimon,ncimon@oregontrail.net,Oregon Rural Action,Oregon,"The draft permits, while well-crafted to deal with possible point-source emissions in the immediate vicinity of the proposed Coyote Island terminal, do not address the much larger problem of the line-source created by the movement of 125 car coal trains. The rail line across the Columbia Basin will be a constant source of emissions, and one that needs to be dealt with if DEQ is to meet it's legal mandate to safeguard the health and welfare of Oregonians by protecting the quality of their air and water.

â€œBased on announced and proposed expansion plans associated with these existing and proposed PNW [Pacific Northwest] export coal terminals, [Powder River Basin] to PNW export coal shipments, which amounted to
 only a few million tons five years ago, could very well exceed 75 million tons per year by 2017 and 170 million tons by 2022.â€&#65533; ~ Heavy Traffic Ahead, July 2012

To put this in perspective, this would mean 34 fully loaded coal trains a day. At any given time there will be anywhere from 6 to 7 coal trains traversing the Basin simultaneously. This near-continuous stream of emissions will provide entrain large amounts of coal dust into the inversion layer. That inversion will then disperse the dust, through the process of diffusion, throughout the layer. Simple calculations show that, at a minimum, 500,000 to 1.1 million pounds of coal dust will be lost from these trains every day.

This is by far the most important air-quality â€“ and water quality â€“ issue that DEQ is legally required to deal with, as it dwarfs the effect in the immediate vicinity of the proposed terminal. One example of the implications from this line source is the potential impact on Class I areas. DEQ's Air Contaminant Discharge Report states that:

â€œThis source is located in an area that is in attainment for all pollutants. This source is not located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of a Class I air quality protection area.â€&#65533;

The diffusion of even a small percentage of the coal dust that will be emitted from the line-source into the inversion layer means that this analysis is wrong. The inversion layer is bounded only by the mountain ranges that border the Columbia Basin. Those mountain ranges host a number of Class I sources. The dust dispersed in the inversion layer will impact them directly as the weeks-long inversions disperse that dust homogeneously into the coherent airshed.

This is just one example of the impacts. Air quality will deteriorate for the entire period of a given wintertime inversion. Since the inversions can last for thirty to forty days, the accumulating coal dust will be of increasing concern to health professionals, farmers, to data centers located in the Basin, and federal and state land managers over that period of time. They and others of rely on good air quality for their livelihoods or to meet their legal mandates.

Moreover, any of the tons/day of coal dust that do not find their way into the inversion layer will fall onto the ground. Much of it will be washed into the waterways during the first precipitation event. Coal dust is abrasive. It will harm invertebrate populations. Those invertebrates provide food for threatened fish populations. The consequence of that must be considered.

The impacts from the line-source associated with the hundreds of miles of rails cannot be ignored. The draft permits must reflect this reality.

Thank you for your time.

To consider a narrow range of impacts in Boardman without taking into account the necessary twin terminal at Port Westward makes no sense whatsoever. DEQ continues to shirk its duties with regard to these proposals; your refusal to broaden the scope of your studies to climate issues runs counter to the Department's own mission statement. Furthermore, your apparent attempt to more easily accommodate citizen participation at the last hearing made it impossible for Oregonians to come together to air concerns on either side of the issue.

I implore Oregon DEQ to demonstrate the same courage as the Washington Dept of Ecology when reviewing Cherry Point called for a detailed assessment of rail transport not only in their state, but out of state; for an assessment on human health; for an assessment of cargo-ship impacts beyond their waters, and an evaluation/disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions of end-use coal combustion.

It is my understanding that DEQ has reviewed and has issued draft permits that indicate that this project properly protects the environment. Further, projects of this type are constructed and operate successfully throughout this country and the rest of the world. The underlying issue appears to me to not really be the environmental affects of this terminal on its surroundings - it appears that this is a straw man argument against the use of coal as a fuel to produce electric power anywhere in the world. First - I would recommend that DEQ focus on their duty - which is to protect the environment in Oregon.

Also - it seems clear to me that coal is going to be utilized throughout the world, particularly the developing world, for at least several more decades. If I were an impoverished person in India or China, I would do everything I could to ensure that I had access to power, which is the linchpin for access to modern medical care, decreased infant mortality, longer life span and quality of life. Coal from the US is mined more safely than in many other countries, and its quality is superior to many other coal supplies. To think that stopping this terminal will actually keep alternative coal supplies from reaching the markets that desire them is incorrect.

Nicholas,Hammers,nic.hammers@usfab.com,Vigor,OR,"Oregonâ€™s regulations require DEQ to issue permits for projects that can comply with the stateâ€™s environmental standards. 

The Morrow Pacific Project clearly meets or exceeds Oregonâ€™s high environmental standards, so I urge DEQ to issue final permits for the project in a timely manner. 

From the time the coal enters the Port of Morrow to when it leaves on ocean-going ships, itâ€™s enclosed to minimize dust and eliminate spillage and handled using systems that meet or exceed industry standards and regulatory requirements. 

Treating this project differently from other commodities just because it involves coal would create a damaging double standard.

As you make your final decision, I also ask DEQ to consider the human impact of this project for Oregonians:

â€¢	The Morrow Pacific project will create more than 2,100 temporary construction-related jobs and more than 1,000 ongoing operations-related jobs -- according to a study by ECON-Northwest.

â€¢	These are family-wage jobs with benefits. 

â€¢	In a state thatâ€™s had higher than average unemployment for 17 years, and suffered even more severe economic damage in rural areas, these jobs are extremely important to families throughout Oregon.

Unnecessary delay on this project could deprive Oregonians across the state of much needed jobs and opportunity.

Thank you for conducting a robust and professional public process so far. 

Please continue the good work by following Oregonâ€™s regulations, issuing this permit in a timely manner, and allowing the project to move forward based on its merits.

Cliff,Goldman,speechflow@yahoo.com,citizen,Oregon,"I am opposed to any permits for coal exports. Some say that we need the jobs so go ahead:  issue the permit, mine, load and ship the coal. No to that! Generating a few temporary jobs is a terrible and tragic trade off for an increase of the spewing forth of arsenic, sulphur, cadmium, mercury, lead as well as the resultant lowering of property values of communities through which coal would shipped through. In fact there would eventually be jobs lost in the shellfish, fishing and wildlife industry with the habitat and dwellers of that habitat adversely affected, not to mention the health of humans and the disruption of emergency transportation routes that could cost lives. 
Would you intentionally hire people to endanger the environment and be harmful to people's health? The coal that would be shipped to China would burn in coal burners, further pollute China, and a significant amount would blow back to the West Coast.

The representatives from the coal companies say that the chemicals mentioned above are already found the earth, naturally, as if to say that  therefore there is no problem. I say why would you want to artificially add to it?

The DEQ should not see this narrowly, that is the DEQ can and should,  in making their ruling, consider all of the area  land and water

 that the coal would have to be transported over not just what goes on at the loading and unloading terminals. Broaden your scope! The entire
environment needs to be considered. Not to do so would be like a cancer patient seeing the doctor and wanting only is mouth to be examined. The problem is systemic. Like disease the damage from coal does not stop at the city limits of the port!!! The coal dust effects CANNOT BE TOTALLY MITIGATED.

Another is that the coal trains coming from Montana and other points will leave coal dust along the route affecting aquatic life there too.

I am a member of the Lake Oswego Sustainability Advisory Board. Today I am writing you a a father and a grandfather with deep concerns about the world we are leaving to the next generations. 
I am opposed to the proposal to export coal from a terminal in Boardman, Oregon. Exporting coal has many negative impacts to the people and environment of Oregon. 
The transportation of coal through the Columbia River will result in the pollution of this scenic area by the toxic coal dust which these trains emit. The transportation of the coal will also result in increased emissions of particulates as well as green house gases from the diesel locomotives. 
The planned volume of rail traffic will disrupt automobile traffic at rail crossings.
The coal terminal will pollute the Columbia River and impact our fisheries.
Burning the coal in Asia will increase the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is already at dangerous levels, and will increase the effects of climate change. In order to prevent the destruction of our culture we should be doing everything in our power to reduce carbon dioxide levels instead of increasing  them. The same logic which drove the establishment of green house gas reduction goals by the state should apply to the decision to establish coal exporting terminals in the state. In addition, the levels of mercury particulates falling on our state will increase from the coal burning in Asia. This will have profound effects on the developing brains of infants and children because mercury is a known neurotoxin.

The fact that our government is not prepared for such an unprecedented threat, is no excuse for allowing the fossil fuel industry to rape everything that is good and decent about the Columbia River, and the people who live along its banks.

We must not rely on the figures of the permittee to be accurate or honest. The lives of people and the safety of our habitat need more protection by the DEQ.   Such heavy commercial pollution of our air,  water, and storm water, over an extended time, would be highly destructive to the states of Washington and Oregon.  DEQ must take time to study this situation and find its own information about the possible effects of the Coyote Island Terminal before allowing one inch of space for fossil fuel pollution. 

Further, the permittee's plan, for DEQ 's monitoring of Coyote Terminal, is extremely inadequate.  For only one example, see what the permittee plans on page 13, No. 29, 30, 31. DEQ should be defining the kind, frequency, and level of monitoring
for safety, not the permittee.  For the permittee to monitor itself is a serious conflict of interest. 

The very corporations who have caused the major pollution problems of our time are those who have written the Coyote proposal.  Our governmental agency should go to great lengths: to protect its people and its River and its countryside and its towns: to protect its citizens and taxpayers; instead of giving the fossil fuel pillagers a free ride.

Jenny,Holmes,jehrestore@gmail.com,"Oregon Interfaith Power and Light, A Program of Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon",Oregon,"Testimony Given on July 9th. I heard that you may have lost some of the testimony so I am sending this in justice in case. 


My name is Jenny Holmes with Oregon Interfaith Power and Light, one of 38 state affiliates of the Interfaith Power and Light campaign since 2001. IPL's mission is to be faithful stewards of Creation by responding to global warming through the promotion of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy We are here today because our mission connects to DEQ's mission and our religious and spiritual values compel us to hold you accountable. As DEQ staff you have the sacred task of protecting Oregon's Environment for the common good. It is not just a job, but a vocation and sacred trust, to ensure that humans and all creatures are protected from environmental harm.

DEQ's mission is to be a leader in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon's air, land and water. DEQ works collaboratively with Oregonians for a healthy, sustainable environment.  Today we are here to talk about the three permits for the Coyote Island Terminal in Board for a coal export terminal related the air, land and water that DEQ is charged make a determination around in line with its mission to restore, maintain and enhance-not degrade. DEQ's  bottom line responsibility to protect public health and the environment in coordinated partnership with citizens and the federal government. Climate change is part of its mandate. DEQ states that it is â€œmeeting the challenge of climate change head-on and participating in statewide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prepare for impacts and help nurture a cleaner, more sustainable Oregon.â€&#65533;
Oregon Interfaith Power and Light and EMO have called for a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Columbia River system coal export projects and a Health Impact Assessment.  The potential health and environmental impacts of the proposed coal export facilities at Coyote Island demand a more comprehensive approach to permitting. We are deeply concerned about the impacts of coal transport in barges and trains on the most vulnerable Oregonians such as children the elderly and those with chronic illness, as well as to the ecological fabric of the Creation that has been entrusted to our care. Creation is an integrated whole and the segmented approach to Coyote Island project is inadequate to the science and the ethics of the situation.  Ignoring impacts of transporting the coal through the Columbia Gorge and on fish and wildlife throughout the route is contrary to DEQ's mission. We request a 401 Water Quality Certification so that all the impacts of dirty coal to the Columbia River can be evaluated. The Columbia is of great spiritual and cultural importance to Columbia River Tribes and the protection of the river is a matter of environmental justice. We request that you deny the air, land and water permits until a comprehensive approach and Health Impact Statement can be performed. 
It is unclear how DEQ will deal with coal pollution from trains that will inevitably get into the Columbia River and local streams. How will it regulate coal pollution from barges. Will the coal pollution from the facility pollute Boardman's drinking water? These and many other questions to which DEQ has no adequate answers should lead the agency to reject these permits. Thank you for you time. ",General,
Anais,Tuepker,anaistuepker@yahoo.com,,Oregon,"I urge the DEQ to be true to its core mandate - to protect the environment of Oregon - and to reject this proposal. At this point in our ecological history, any project that increases coal consumption will unavoidably contribute to global warming. While I also have real concerns about the more immediate pollution effects and increased noise and traffic impacts from shipping an unprecented amount of coal on our Columbia River, these are only a small part of the reason I am adamantly opposed to this project. Our state should be planning ahead to the transition to a fossil-fuel free future, and not subsidizing in any way the continued reliance on unsustainable fuels. Money spent on monitoring this project over the years would be one such indirect subsidy. We have no time to waste in transitioning away from coal use. Let's be leaders and acknowledge that by harming the global climate, coal exports unavoidably harm our state's environment. We must not define harms narrowly when faced with unprecented climate challenges. ",,
Diana,Gordon,tndgardens@comcast.net,,WA,"Gentlemen,

I very much oppose the proposed Coyote Island Terminal.  Because it is so close to the Columbia River, I fear that the dangerous chemicals such as mercury which coal contains will somehow find their way to the river.  

Further, although the DEQ claims to have 
no control over the effects of the coal for 
the rest of the coal's journey from Montana to Asia, it is clear that there will be a huge impacts from this journey.   For
example, coal dust will surely blow off the
open cars as they cross the Columbia River into the water.

Please do what you can to oppose this terminal
now.
