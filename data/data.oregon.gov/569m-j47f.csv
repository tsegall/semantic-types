Katharine,Salzmann,katharinesalzmann@gmail.com,,OR,"We must never forget that a permit has conventionally been used as permission to pollute our shared environment. It is a form of temporary absolution, an indulgence that has really only postponed accountability and entrance into the dangerous, toxic purgatory we see unfolding around us now. I support this fee increase. But I wonder if 3% is enough. Perhaps permits could begin to be tiered not based on discharge but based on a business's pollution prevention measures. That way, a business could choose which is cheaper for them: pollution control technologies, high permit fees, fines, production cutbacks or closure. DEQ should be doing everything in its power at this point in the history of environmental degradation to inhibit the discharge of toxic chemicals into our shared environment. Period. ",
Roberet,Olsen,bil76fish@gmail.com,retired,or,If you would consider reducing the salaries of all your so called important staff to the level of increases of annual social security  I'm sure you would find it easier to balance your so called budget. I live on ss and I have no choice -- I have to live within mem means or die .  What choice do you law makers have?,
robert,olsen,bil76fish@gmail.com,tax payer,Oregon,"the DEQ already is funded to accomplish the goals of the Trump Administration.
The DEQ already has an over staffed and over paid group to conduct the adequate business congress has deligated.  I SAY THIS with the words of previous elected representatives and senators who said that wet lands should be wet when they voted.  The DEQ who is not elected decided to make rules that was not strict enough.  This rule is the same .  I would defund the DEQ because they over step their authority.

James,White,jimwhite@eoni.com,,Oregon,"I am tired of orgs just raising prices when they cannot live within their means. Our town just imposed a $3 a month ""safety fee"" for persons and a $5 a month fee for businesses. My electric goes up every year and insurance and medical goes up every year and once in a while I get a 1% cost of living increase which does not come close to covering my always rising cost to exist. How nice it would be if I wanted a new something and I could just go to my employer and say ""well next month you are going to pay me 17% more' and they had no choice or options. Would that not be fair?",
Mark ,Vroman,,Timber Industry,or,"DEQ fees are used for processing paperwork to track operators. Fees do not produce clean air of water. Fees are self serving budgets for growing public agencies. Once a fee is established, rate increases are required. Operators are always paying more to public regulators for the same permit.",
james,lahoe,james455@centurytel.net,,Washington,why is ssi up 1 % every thing else is up 3%,
Jeff,Walden,walponder@gmail.com,Mr.,OR,"I tracked DEQ fine assessments for several months.  When I stopped this ""overview"" approximately $1.5 million in fines had been assessed.  If these fines are collected regularly, where does this money go?  If you do collect it all and put it to good use you are worth your salt.  If not you just become a paper pushing bureaucracy.  Please advise and reply.

Perry,Dunlap,dunlapseptic1984@gmail.com,Dunlap Septic,OREGON,"I am against of this increase. I have been in the on site waste Water industry for 34 yrs. in Jackson & Josephine County. I watched Jackson County Sanitaiton Dept. through the years increase there Fees and with that more unpermitted septic's went in.. 
 Now that the State took Over we are seeing less trained an under qualified regulators hired and less inspections and miss soils evaluations . As a advocate for the public in  Southern Oregon the Public is getting Fed up with lack of qualified inspectors with amount of Fees charge for ? This increase is not going to help with the issues at hand. We feel DEQ needs to help there program and step up and then maybe in a few years talk about an increase in fees.",
James,White,jimwhite@eoni.com,,Oregon,"I wish the governing bodies would quit calling more taxes ""fees"" We are all being ""fee to death"" Our city just mandated a ""safety fee"" all of our costs of living are exceeding our pay raises so all of us are going backwards. You know that if it was brought before the voters as another tax if would be voted down. We have no options when un-elected bodies impose more ""fees"" upon us, so why even ask for our opinions. I have to live within my means so why can't the people who steal our money do the same thing?
It would be nice if I had the same power and told my boss that next month you have to pay me 17% more and they had no choice. The public is tired of this kind of governing. I hope to retire soon and move OUT of Oregon. It is not the same state I was born into.",

Subject:  Water Quality Permitting Division 45 and 71 Rule Update

Dear Mr. Knight:

The Oregon Association of Clean Water Agencies (ACWA) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Department of Environment Qualityâ€™s (DEQ) proposed rule updates.  ACWA is a private, not-for-profit organization of Oregonâ€™s wastewater treatment and stormwater management utilities, along with associated professionals.  Our 135 statewide members are dedicated to protecting and enhancing Oregonâ€™s water quality.  Our members provide wastewater and stormwater services to 2.4 million Oregonians, serving 64% of Oregonâ€™s homes and businesses.

ACWA participated in the Fiscal Advisory Committee (FAC), and recognizes that DEQ staff has revised the preliminarily proposed rule changes to address many of the issues and concerns that were raised during FAC review.  The comments below reflect ACWAâ€™s remaining concerns about the proposed rules. 

â€¢	The major permit modification fee for WPCF permits should be the same as that which is charged for MS4 permits.
In Table 70C, the major permit modification fee is listed as $2,065.  This is the same amount as what is charged for a major permit modification fee for a nondischarging lagoon.  ACWA believes that the work required for a WPCF permit modification is more similar to the work required for a major permit modification for an MS4 permit, and that the fee should reflect that similarity.  The proposed fee is out of scale with the nature of the permit and the work required.



â€¢	The descriptors â€œsewageâ€&#65533; or â€œsewage treatmentâ€&#65533; should be retained in the Table 70F fee schedule.
In Table 70F, the words â€œsewageâ€&#65533; or â€œsewage treatmentâ€&#65533; were removed as descriptors of facilities for which there are technical activities or plan review fees listed.  Without these descriptors retained for these WPCF-permitted activities, the fees could be more broadly interpreted for activities that were not intended.  For example, the addition of a stormwater UIC is not what DEQ was intending to charge these fees for when a new facility is added, and technical or plan review activities are not warranted for them.
 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the advisory committee and public processes to review DEQâ€™s proposed rule changes.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at smith@oracwa.

Executive Director
