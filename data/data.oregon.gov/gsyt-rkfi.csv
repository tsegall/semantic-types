Someone, kindly help me to understand how is it that 
SB 705 Asbestos Rule-Making Requirement mandating survey PRIOR to a residential demolition continues to be blindsided when it comes to beautiful treasured turn-of-the-century bungalows constructed in
Mixed Commercial zones; e.g., along SE Division, SE Hawthorne Blvd., and SE Belmont?    
 
Take for example:
 
Four Stories Proposed to Replace 1909 Hawthorne Home ...
www.portlandchronicle.com/four-stories-replace-106-year-old-hawthorn...
Jan 14, 2015 - Demolition Confirmed for 1909 Hawthorne Home, Protest Today ... Theproperty is located at 3423 SE Hawthorne Blvd. in the Sunnyside neighborhood. ... A sign on on the house reads â€œHawthorne Monkey Tail Apartments.â€&#65533;.
 
I have been told, that Developer's sub-Contractor was not required to notify immediate property owners when to expect their dumpster to arrive,
giving a seven (7) day notice -- via a door-hanger.   Did I fail to mention, located next door to a open patio, where patrons sat eating meals?
 
Nor is the Developer's sub-Contractor required to issue protective eye/face masks, leather gloves for their demolition crews.  So at what point
does OSHA come into play here?
 
 
 
How?   DRAC start lobbying both the State of Oregon and the city of Portland to close the gap between citizen complaint calling for DEQ Inspectors completing their survey and BDS requesting DEQ documentation, prior to issuing the Developer a demolition permit regardless of the ZONE(S) existing.   Least I remind you, there were three zones under the new Southeast 101 condos constructed between Peacock Lane's backyard fences and SE Cesar E. Chavez Blvd. S.    
How difficult is it to included a RED CHECK OFF BOX STAMPED on the top of the existing BDS Demolition Permit forms?  
 
Final question, at what point will DRAC volunteers agree to bring this truly provocative and spirited discussion forward to the movers and shakes?  Do whatever it takes for DEQ and BDS to best alert immediate property owners that the demolition dumpsters are coming?   Surely, ""We the People"" have the right to know when to expect toxic asbestos and lead paint dust flying in the air they breathe.    
 
Your thoughts?

James ,Dunlop ,jrdandasso@hotmail.com,concerned citizen ,Oregon,"I worked for an abatement company for three years, then for an inspection company for four years in Colorado. In order to conduct asbestos surveys/ inspections in the state of Colorado you had to be accredited as an EPA/ AHERA Building Inspector and pass a state exam. My brother-in-law works in northern California for an inspection company and they have to be accredited as an EPA/ AHERA Building Inspector and Contractor/Supervisor, pass a state exam to become a Certified Site Surveillance Technician and work under the supervision of a Certified Asbestos Consultant. I feel the state of Oregon should impose similar certification standards and mandate a state exam. Asbestos is a known carcinogenic, has killed many people and the EPA states there is no safe level. This not something to take lightly. NESHAP, MAP (ASHARA), OSHA and AHERA are the four major asbestos regulations, each is a different federal regulation with their own agendas. Asbestos regulations are not a simplistic as you might think. I concur with Mr. Baker's comment that everything should be tested, and have no square footage limit or limited number of dwellings per any project, because size is irrelevant for any asbestos fiber.

Â·       It is essential for the health our community that verification of certified surveys and abatement activity should be required by Oregon DEQ and become part of the process before a residential demolition can proceed.

Â·       Additionally, there shoud be no year of construction cut-off date for requiring an asbestos survey before demolition, as it is logistically impossible to monitor and insure in all levels of construction that some residual component of asbestos is not present, and this should be preemptively rather than reactively approached.",

Sharon,Genasci,sgenasci@spiritone.com,NWDA Air Quality Committee,Oregon,"Draft Written Testimony to Environmental Quality Commission on Rules for Asbestos Abatement in demolitions (SB 705)


My name is Sharon Genasci, and I am Chair of the NWDA Air Quality Committee.  I live on Johnson Street in NW Portland.

January 25, 2016
1100 demolitions have taken place in Portland in the last four years, with little protection of neighboring homes from extremely toxic asbestos.  Neighbors are not warned to protect themselves and their children, and workers in recycling and other occupations handling the debris are unnecessarily exposed.  Asbestos exposure is known to cause cancer. 

First, it is important that the current language, â€œthe owner or operator submit (an)â€¦ asbestos survey report to DEQ upon DEQâ€™s requestâ€&#65533; should be changed to â€˜Owners and operators proposing demolitions and renovations where asbestos is suspected (pre January 1, 2004) shall submit to pre demolition inspections by certified asbestos inspectors.  Strike â€œupon DEQ requestâ€&#65533;.

Second, DEQ and BDS must  coordinate their issuance of demolition permits to accommodate the pre demolition inspections.

Third, All materials and debris from these sites must be disposed of under the direction of the Asbestos Inspectors.  The rules should include clear directions regarding how and where asbestos debris is handled and disposed.

 Fourth,  renovations of asbestos contaminated buildings should fall under the same scrutiny as the demolitions.  

 Finally, it is unconscionable for Oregon DEQ to wait until 2017 to make these rules. Slack DEQ oversight in part led to lead in drinking water in Flint.  Asbestos is a no brainer for causing public health concerns.  Letâ€™s ask DEQ to do the right thing for our state without delay.

,,,Dean Gisvold,Oregon,"Dear DEQ:

As chair of the Irvington Community Association (ICA) land use committee (Committee), I am submitting the following testimony and resolutions of the Committee unanimously approved last night at its regular monthly meeting.

Some background.  The Irvington Historic District, approved by the City, State, and Federal governments in 2010, is the largest historic district in the State of Oregon by a factor of three.  The District had its first demolition two months ago (the Suh House Demo) without notice to neighbors and the neighborhood, and with no protection against the spread of asbestos to the surrounding homes and residents and to the Irvington Elementary School, only 250 feet away.  The contractor knocked the 1920s house down in a few hours with only a garden hose to deal with clouds of who knows what.  If you would like to see videos and pictures, please let me know and I can provide same. 

Although we applaud the intent of SB 705, we know it has two major weaknesses that must be corrected to make it effective and provide protection against demolitions like the Suh House Demo. 

1.  The major weakness is that the property owner and/or contractor are not required to show proof or evidence of a completed asbestos survey prior to a demo permit being issued.  Reliance on the owner or contractor to perform the survey on their own does not reflect the realty of the demolition business or of the market place.  The survey must precede the permit, and if asbestos is present, then an abatement plan must be presented before any permit is issued.  Many jurisdictions have this requirement and it works.  Requiring the neighbors to complain in order to trigger the survey does not reflect the real world.  There was no notice of the Suh House Demo until a huge yellow backhoe appeared on site early on a Monday morning.  The demolition was completed before any complaint could have been processed by anyone.  This significant loophole makes the rule meaningless to our historic district.  If DEQ is serious about protecting the health of Oregonians, then this rule must be improved. 

2.  Limiting the application of this rule to only houses built before January 1, 2004, appears totally arbitrary and not effective.  There should be no cut-off date since it is possible for building materials that contain asbestos manufactured outside the USA finding their way into domestic construction.  A survey should be required, and if no asbestos is found, then the demo permit should be issued.
 
Finally, the Committee believes that the above testimony and resolutions reflect prior actions of the ICA Board of Directors.  However, for full disclosure, the ICA Board will not meet until the second Thursday in February and did not consider the above resolutions.  I intend to bring this matter before the Board in February, and ask for ratification, which action, positive or negative, I will pass on to DEQ.

Bruce,Philbrick,bruce.philbrick@oregonmetro.gov,Metro,Oregon,"Metro comment:  SB 705 Asbestos Survey 2016 Permanent Rulemaking

Metro supports the Environment Quality Commission taking immediate action to address a clear public health need by adopting the proposed rule. However, we believe additional steps are needed in both the near and longer term to address the hazards posed by asbestos from construction and demolition (C&D) activities. While the survey requirement may increase awareness of when abatement activities need to occur, the new rule is shifting much of the burden of identifying asbestos-containing materials (ACM) to processing and transfer facilities.

 Metro is responsible for two solid waste transfer stations in the Portland metropolitan area. Both these facilities regularly receive large quantities of C&D materials. In response to the new temporary rule requiring surveys on all residential structures built before 2004 prior to demolition, Metro has implemented a survey requirement for all drop-box loads of C&D as of January 1, 2016.
  
There is very little visual difference in the debris generated from demolition versus remodeling when viewed in an incoming drop-box or waste load. Our transfer stations are faced with the difficult task of knowing whether any particular load of construction materials came from a work site where inspection and abatement was required by DEQ or not. Metroâ€™s facilities are witnessing customers bringing suspect materials who didnâ€™t understand their responsibilities for managing ACM. As a result, we are turning away entire loads in the absence of a survey or haulers are going elsewhere because they do not have the right paperwork. Because DEQ appears to be enforcing a â€œzeroâ€&#65533; tolerance approach to acceptance of ACM, regardless of source, it may lead to customers attempting to dispose of suspect materials at private processing facilities or illegally dump. Private facilities including roofing processing facilities and material recovery facilities are also faced with this difficult challenge.  DEQ needs to consider and develop a practical approach to management of suspected ACM at solid waste management facilities.  In addition, it appears that asbestos is being used in the manufacturing of new building materials, making the challenges of asbestos management at facilities even more difficult.

We believe there are several things DEQ should do to address the problems arising from our efforts to implement the temporary rule.  First, we support DEQ developing more informational materials and providing education about asbestos requirements to not only construction and demolition contractors but also homeowners. Second, we also support DEQ placing more staff into the field to observe what is actually happening at work sites. We believe the point of generation should be the primary focus of asbestos management. While our supporting work at transfer stations is important, working upstream will be the most effective strategy to actually minimize the release of asbestos through proper containment and management. Excluding whole classes of generators (i.e. homeowners; residential renovation and remodeling contractors) from a survey requirement further complicates load acceptance at the point of disposal.
After adoption of this rule, Metro believes a larger set of issues regarding identification and management of asbestos needs to be addressed, including: 
â€¢	Asbestos rules should cover not just whole house demolitions, but other residential remodeling/renovations, major alterations and additions to existing homes. The survey and asbestos management rules should apply to all generators including homeowners conducting their own work on these project types. 
â€¢	The requirements regarding how asbestos surveys are conducted should be closely examined. We are concerned that current survey practices and procedures may not be adequate and may be missing significant amounts of hidden or hard to reach ACM. This missed material could result in the presence of asbestos in the demolition debris pile from a structure that has been surveyed and abated.
â€¢	DEQ needs to work with the construction industry to gain a better understanding of what products are being manufactured and used in the Portland area and whether these products create the same risk as the older materials.

We suggest addressing these issues by examining and revising existing administrative rules regarding how asbestos is managed. Alternatively, DEQ and EQC may wish to consider establishing a public workgroup to develop recommendations for possible changes to administrative rules and state statutes.
