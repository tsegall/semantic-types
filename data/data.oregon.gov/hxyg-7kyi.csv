ALDEN,MOFFATT,alden.moffatt@gmail.com,,Oregon,"The advisory committee absolutely must include chemists who can analyze the mixtures of air toxics and likely effects.
The advisory committee must include wildlife and insect experts as wildlife and insects are also effected by air toxics. They are stakeholders too.
As air toxics don't have boundaries, wildlife and people downwind are also stakeholders, so things that happen in rural areas effect the air in other areas including big cities in other states.
I have to say right off, I am extremely disappointed in the air toxics monitoring all across Oregon. I don't know how decision makers can ever make decisions if there is absolutely NO DATA. Oregon has extremely polluted air probably on a par with the USA's most polluted cities. I don't have DATA so it is impossible to explain that to any advisory committee, no matter who the committee consists of. You can't make decisions based on NOTHING but speculation. DEQ needs to get with it, in a huge way. Your program is just plain old NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

Brian,Wegener,brian@tualatinriverkeepers.org,Tualatin Riverkeepers,Oregon,"With recent events with around the Bullseye Glass toxic air discharges, the media has repeatedly reported that many people perceive that DEQ is reluctant to enforce environmental laws and regulations. This public perception is not new.  In 2005 the Sunday Oregonian reported that the Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) collected more in environmental penalties than DEQ.   (See attached.)

In order to address this longstanding and widespread public perception that DEQ is reluctant to enforce, I suggest that the Cleaner Air Oregon Advisory Committee include environmental lawyers with a proven track record of environmental enforcement.  It would benefit the people of Oregon if this committee included a representative of NEDC and/or CRAG Law Center in addition to the members you have listed.

Kyle,Stephens,stephens_kyle@yahoo.com,None,Oregon,"Hi,

I strongly suggest that the City of Portland Neighborhood Associations be included as a stakeholder.  A group of people could be selected from those neighborhoods associations most impacted by poor air quality in the metropolitan region.   

The current list of  stakeholders does not represent the people directly impacted by air quality. How can you draft rules to improve air quality for residents of Oregon without directly engaging and receiving advice from the citizens of the state most impacted by poor air quality?  Residents from other parts of the state could be selected to represent greater Oregon as another stakeholder group.  

I don't know how the selection process would work but in the City of Portland, the Neighborhood Associations would be an easy and logical place to request volunteers to serve as part of stakeholder group.  The Associations are  comprised of people who have already taken an active interest in their community and they have shown a willingness to dedicate their time.  These are the people that will bring the necessary dedication to make the stakeholder group work.

Thanks for the change to comment.",

Katharine,Salzmann,katharinesalzmann@gmail.com,Ms.,Or,"It is rather appalling that this health-based advisory committee has no proposed physicians or toxicologists on it. The proposed seats are heavy with industry and legislative voices but where are the scientists and doctors? The ones who are really in a position to offer knowledgable advice about the human health impacts of the  toxics being regulated? This seems like a serious oversight. I would like AT LEAST FIVE professionals from this category added to this committee. Physicians and scientists/toxicologists should really be taking the lead on this conversation, their voices and knowledge should carry the most weight and they should be represented in large numbers on this committee.

Frank,Brook,frank.n.brook@gmail.com,Hobbyist,UK Resident,"I note with concern that you are already taking disproportionate and unreasonable actions that are are difficult to justify rationally against glass manufacturers, of which Bullseye and Uroboros are two that I am aware of here in the UK.

I note with concern that your actions do not appear to be based on sound science and are therefore self-evidently ill-informed. Do you have indisputable science (medical or otherwise) evidence to suggest any of your actions were proportionate or rational? I see little evidence of rational informed actions by you to date.

I note with concern that you intend to be guided in future reforms of toxics regulation by a regulatory advisory committee ""INFORMED BY PUBLIC COMMENT"". This is ill-advised and irrational behaviour. The ""public"" are not known for their expertise or skills in matters of environmental monitoring or toxicity assessment.

I note with concern that your actions to-date and your intentions are those of an ill-informed bully taking predictably stupid knee-jerk reactions that are indicative of the worst of politics that I also see in the UK. A rational behaviour would be to gather sound scientific evidence and to consult and work constructively with the glass manufacturers. The glass manufacturers are demonstrating good corporate citizenship by their actions already. I submit that your actions are quite the reverse. 

As a relatively minor UK user of stained glass, I am saddened to see that one of the three major US glass manufacturers (Spectrum) is closing, leaving Spectrum and Uroboros as the two remaining quality suppliers of stained glass that I can use and rely upon. Be aware that the three glass manufacturers are and have been a beacon to the world for their expertise and quality. They have a well-earned and justifiably good reputation globally. They are a credit to the USA. They are a positive contributors to its economy and culturally though the world of art and design.

If you believe that the USA is a great country and leads the world, then why are you attempting to close down leading examples of your expertise in stained glass manufacture? Are you attempting to push your country into terminal decline as appears to be happening through the stupidity of bureaucrats and politicians here in the UK? Be proud that you have some of the world's leading glass manufacturers and start to behave sensibly. Work with them to maintain your leading position in the world.

If you persist in your ill-advised irrational actions and drive Bullseye and Uroboros ""to the wall"" you will affect many thousands of glass workers AROUND THE WORLD.  Drive them out of business and my hobby is ended, as will be the entire businesses of many thousands of glass workers around the world.

As a penultimate comment I should note that I am an ex Health and Safety Representative so am reasonably well informed in matters relating to health and safety and am aware of the nature of H&S issues and regulation in the USA. Even though I am in the UK, I am aware that there are many more pressing H&S issues in the USA that you ought to be addressing with greater priority and that your nation, in the politest way I can describe it, is not leading the way in this subject area!

As a final comment I should also note that I have a degree in Botany (plants) and have been a member of the British Lichen Society for many years (until recently). I understand your forestry people have detected metals in ""tree moss"" (lichens). They know about trees. I know about lichens. That metals are detected in ""tree moss"" is no surprise to me as a botanist as they are noted for their active accumulation of metals. They have been studied for many years particularly in Wales where they are found happily accumulating heavy metals in the slag heaps of long-defunct metal mining areas in Wales. So, finding some metals in lichens is INSUFFICIENT evidence on which to take adverse actions against the glass manufacturers.

In conclusion, I have one simple and reasonable demand: Ensure ALL your decisions are soundly justified by real science and ensure you relegate speculation, ill-informed opinion and partisan bias into the wastebasket of meaningless chatter.

Do your job. Properly.

CGCC a few weeks ago.  I was glad to hear of the formation for the Cleaner Air Oregon regulatory advisory committee and 
appreciated the opportunity to provide i
input.

As a nurse I provide care for the elderly in the clinic and home settings. In addition, I'm around children and my personal activities
 are largely spent outdoors.  
I feel there is a great need to have a health based regulatory committee with representatives from the human health and environmental arena.  In addition, I feel the needs of the elderly and pediatrics populations need to be represented.
I would like to see The Dalles Air Coalition represented on the committee and would like to nominated Rachael Naijar to be on the committee. Her background in Public Health,
living in The Dalles and her having concerns for her children and our community support my recommendation to you. 

Again, I thank you for the opportunity for me to submit my comments.  My ope is that you will agree to have The Dalles Air Coalition represented on the Cleaner Air Oregon advisory committee. I believe Rachael would be a strong asset for all.

Effie,Greathouse,drcsdirector@gmail.com,MyAirSample.org,Oregon,"The technical workgroup and the proposed members for this advisory committee do not yet have any representatives from Oregon's public universities.  Our universities are uniquely poised to contribute to this process.  Our universities employ cutting edge researchers and research groups dealing with toxics and professors with in-depth and nuanced perspective from years of doing research and academic service -- from a perspective of public health and service to the public.

The technical workgroup has assembled a credentialed and experienced group of scientists from government and private environmental consulting businesses.  The advisory committee, thus far, has proposals to represent local government and community groups.  But we are lacking representation from the scientists in Oregon who serve the people in their capacity as public university scientists and are invested in Oregon as their home.

Professors, faculty, and researchers with in-depth subject matter expertise from OHSU, OSU, PSU and U of O need to be brought in to this advisory committee, given that they have not been tapped for the technical workgroup.

Specific departments and research centers to look for prospective committee members include Oregon State University's premier Superfund Research Program (http://superfund.oregonstate.edu/), OHSU's and PSU's research centers and departments in public health and sustainability, including the Institute for Sustainable Solutions (https://www.pdx.edu/sustainability/institute-for-sustainable-solutions) and the Toulane School for Urban Studies and Planning (https://www.pdx.edu/usp/welcome).  These examples are just a few of the research centers with professors who would bring relevant experience and expertise, and a solid command of the sciences involved.",

Christopher,Lowe,clowe@igc.org,,Oregon ,"To me it is of paramount importance that air toxics regulatory reform make clear that protection of the public health is THE paramount goal of toxics regulation. The currently identified stakeholders may not in my opinion adequately represent the public health interest.  In particular I am concerned that the Advisory Committee include persons able to articulate why the current quantiities of emissions based permitting structure of regulation does not sufficiently protect the pubic health, and able to articulate the kind of architecture of regulation needed for regulations to be truly based on protecting the public health. 

One individual whom I know personally whom I would like to nominate for the Advisory Committee is Dr. Susan Katz.  Dr. Katz is a retired pediatrician and a long time advocate in environmental health with Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility. Working with OPSR she has developed science based educational information to provide the public with accurate information about toxic substances and the state of research regarding types and levels of threat to health that may be posed by exposures.  She also has engaged at the state and national levels with regulatory advocacy.  Thus she possesses both the scientific background to evaluate technical reports, and the legislative experience to be able to evaluate and recommend regarding the forms of regulations.  

Another person I would like to nominate is Dr. Diana Rohlman of the College of Public Health and Human Sciences at  Oregon State University.  Professor Rohlman's Ph.D is in Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, and her publications include technical work on mobile and community based toxic exposure sampling.  Another important part of her work involves health communication making scientific information available to communities.  In particular she has worked on community science education and health communication in Native American Indian communities and rural communities. 

Dr. Rohlman is also active with the Planning Committee on Health Environments at the Oregon Public Health Association.
