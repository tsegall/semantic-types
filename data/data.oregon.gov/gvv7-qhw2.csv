Chris,Carvalho,,,OR,"As a cancer survivor, I must ask for much stronger protections in the Cleaner Air Oregon plan. As currently written, it does little to bring down cancer risk. The original, stronger rules proposed in the 2017 legislative session were similar to those in 20 other states. Oregon should be a leader, not a follower, when it comes to protecting the health of our citizens. When businesses say they might leave the state if we adopted rules that already are in force in those twenty states, that is a bluff. Many would likely stay and adapt. For the few that would leave, I say good riddance. We can find other businesses that would love to come to Oregon and be responsible environmental citizens. By delaying the time for polluters to comply except for the 80 largest ones, the pollution around my home will not be improved for many years. My area has high levels of wood smoke, fine diesel particulate, and benzene. These come from sources that aren't from a particular business site. The hardship provision simply allows companies to claim they are in financial trouble, and can easily manipulate their books to ""prove"" it. If we are to have the ""predictable, consistent"" rules the plan claims, they must apply to all polluters without exception. The plan must do away with the waiver provision that allows political influence to trump science and prevent the fair application of pollution limits to all businesses. If companies were allowed to increase cancer risk around their facilities by as much as 500 cases per million, Oregon could become a state where two thirds of our counties' cancer risks would be above the national average. That's not quality of life; it's quantity of death. Oregon should commission the services of Art Williams, the person who crafted Louisville, Kentucky's award-winning toxics regulation program. His comments about the shortcomings of Oregon's plan are spot-on. He successfully avoided the mistakes we are about to make. There is no excuse for the NIMBYism of putting a substandard program in place when there is an excellent proof of concept with a great track record. Oregon needs to put the onus of information gathering on pollutants onto businesses and not require DEQ to do the work. It's hard to get legislative funding in our current environment. We also need to adopt the Community Toxics Right-to-Know framework for our law. It is not enough to notify the public when a recommended action level is exceeded. We need to know what's being dumped into our air and water, regardless of the concentration. Action levels can be manipulated to hide pollution. Full disclosure protects against this. Citizens need to know what pollutants are present, and our government needs to stop giving corporations the cover to hide that information from us. Please do the right thing for Oregonians. Make our plan the national leader, and implement community toxics right-to-know. The health of all Oregonians rests in your hands. Our economy can handle the costs of a safe, healthy environment.

,Willis,Lissa.Willis@comcast.net,League of Women Voters Oregon,Oregon,"I am writing to support clean air standards in Oregon. In particular, I support 
adequate standards for control of all sources of pollution
strict enforcement of established rules and regulations
a comprehensive, coordinated program for management of air as a natural resource, and
adequate financing for air pollution abatement programs

I see that in the Draft Rules Tables the allowable number of cancer deaths from toxic emission from existing factories has been increased from 10 people per million to 500 people per million. Also, the Hazard Index related to chronic non-cancer diseases for existing factories has increased from 1 to 30 for the new rules. These numbers are unacceptable: too high and not health-based. 

Also, the timeline to bring all companies under the Cleaner Air Oregon is too long. Only 80 of Oregon's 2,500 companies will be included in the first five years. The Department of Environmental Quality has been sufficiently funded to hire necessary personnel to enact the new rules, or to finish a vital statewide emissions inventory. 

Cleaner Air Oregon cannot happen without funding and political will. The rules need to be grounded in science, informed by data and health-based.  Further, the work needs to be funded in order to meet those standards.

I have lived in SE Portland for 20 years, and like many residents, was stunned to hear about the high levels of pollutants allowed in our beautiful city. I have since learned that it's a complex problem involving lax diesel regulations and the unusually close proximity of industrial sites to neighborhoods. 

As a cancer survivor and mom to a school-age child, I believe strongly that we ALL deserve to breathe clean air. 

What will it take for Oregon to catch up with our neighbors to the south and the north, and clean up our air once and for all? There's plenty of passion behind the drive, but over and over our state government bows to industry pressure and fails to allot the funds needed to fix the problem.

Re:  The Clean Air Standards as proposed:

We need strong health/science-based goals to keep Oregon citizenâ€™s healthy. . .we owe it to our children.
We canâ€™t put off for years implementing health standards. Standards should be strong and implemented immediately.   How many people have to die before we regulate industries in the state which are contaminating basic health conditions?  All living things require clean air and water.

Larry and Nancy ,Mauter,osomauter3@att.net,,Oregon,"â€œYou picked it up along the way.â€&#65533;

That was the explanation my mother got when she was diagnosed with mesothelioma, that rare and deadly cancer caused by contact with asbestos (1332-21-4).

What a callous society we have become when environmental toxins are casually explained as the simple random consequence of living.  

All of us are at risk of exposure not only to industrial toxins such as asbestos but we also â€œpick up along the wayâ€&#65533; daily doses of tail pipe exhaust and agricultural pollutants in the forms of pesticides. For some of us, the lead in our water is a critical issue.  Total up those risks and then add in the increasing health threats associated with climate change, such as asthma, allergies, and the spread of infectious diseases.
Those of us who live in neighborhoods close to industries that discharge their toxic byproducts into our air are at even greater risk for illness and premature death. We must address this issue with comprehensive reforms to close the gaps in the current regulations.

We need to take into consideration the costs of air quality improvement that industry needs to shoulder, with the cost of medical care to treat cancer. According to a Duke University Medical Center study, out-of-pocket expenses (with health insurance) average $712 a month (2012) for doctors appointments, lost wages, medicines and travel expenses. These costs are shouldered by the individuals and families. Industry may rebut that they canâ€™t afford it, well neither can the average  citizen who needs medical care.


Environmental regulations work, and Oregon should be doing all it can to reduce  air pollution and hold our stateâ€™s industries to the highest standards for air quality. The benefits are clear:  we benefit by controlling health care costs and we benefit by making sure all communities, regardless of their socio-economic  status, are protected from hazards in the air we breathe.


Cleaner Air Oregonâ€™s mission is to protect the health and well-being of all Oregonians, and in that spirit, I offer the following comments on the proposed rules:

1) Regarding Rule Number 340-245-0030
ALL facilities need to be regulated for air pollution. Human bodies needs to breathe regardless of whether pollution spews out of a new plant or an old one. The suggestion that only new, modified, reconstructed need to comply with the toughest standards is ludicrous. The  statement â€œexisting sources will not be permitted above Existing Source Permit Action Levels of 500 in 1 millionâ€&#65533; needs to be modified.

2)Regarding Rule Number 340-245-0030
Cleaner Air Oregon must set pollution levels to achieve the lowest possible cancer risk, especially since these new rules wonâ€™t be enforced for more than a decade. Cancer risk levels should be set to 10 per million for new facilities and 25 per million for older facilities. But should be lower in neighborhoods that are close to factories.

3)Regarding Rule Number 340-245-0320
Accuracy in pollutant reporting must be mandatory. Averaging a chemicalâ€™s output into the atmosphere over the entire facility or over time only dilutes the statistic. The slogan â€œThe solution to pollution is dilutionâ€&#65533; should not apply. Once a particle enters the body, that body is compromised. Human tissue absorbs toxins and can store them for long periods of time before wreaking havoc on the system. 
Regulate for single emission units and discontinue averaging of hazardous air pollutants. The word â€œestimateâ€&#65533; needs to be eliminated when referencing types of air toxins emitted.

4) Regarding Rule Number 340-245-0500
Legislators need to adequately fund the DEQ and the OHA to enforce these rules. Funding for this enforcement should come from those that need air quality permits. Establishing a policy means nothing if enforcement is absent. 

With strong rules and consistent enforcement of clean air standards, Oregonians in the future may well be spared the useless explanation â€œyou picked it up along the wayâ€&#65533; as our health and our environment improve together. ",
Suzanne,Moulton,puttytwist@yahoo.com,,OR,"Would you want your kids to smoke two cigarettes a day? That is the equivalent of Portland air pollution DEQ is allowing from major industry in Portland. 

Please enforce the legally mandated emission controls on oil refineries and transfer stations. Do not allow those major polluters to apply for permits to pollute. It's especially misleading to the public when we have voted on an emissions standard then DEQ allows for these permits without much reporting to the public outside of small memos berried in a website. There must be more outreach for public comment, like an announcement in major local newspapers or news media. 

As you likely know, Oregon has the third largest population out of the fifty states that are at risk of excess cancer due to air pollution. My mom died from lung cancer here in Portland seven years ago today, and I now take care of my dad that suffers from severe emphysema that limits his mobility. 

I teach lots of kids in the Portland area, and it trouble me to think that they might one day have to face care-taking their parents before their time and helplessly watch them deteriorate into an early grave, like I have.

Beeara,Edmonds,beeara@beeara.com,,OR,"I am concerned about the proposed Cleaner Air Oregon Air Quality regulations that have been drafted up. While I understand that some of whatâ€™s been drafted is good, there are several issues that are not stringent enough. Having lived in Corvallis for more than 12 years ago, just 1/2 mile from H & V glass fiber facility, I have noticed huge health challenges for my husband and several neighborhood friends, challenges that donâ€™t seem normal. Chronic sinusitis shouldnâ€™t have to be the case for ones who are making healthy lifestyle choices and I truly believe that air quality, something we have no control over, is a huge factor. As the population in this state continues to increase, there will be increases in pollutants via automobile usage. We canâ€™t afford to be lax in terms of corporate pollutants.

Going over the regulations, I see that there is not enough requirement for small particulates to be measured and controlled. In the case of our glass fiber facility, that means tiny particulates are getting in our air. Iâ€™m concerned and worried about this. Iâ€™ve also noticed that cancer risk has increased for some of the allowable particulates. This should not be acceptable. In fact we should be working to improve not slide on that risk. Human health is the greatest asset we have and we shouldnâ€™t be compromising it for corporate profits. Accuracy in reporting is of the utmost importance. There should not be any gray areas about this. Itâ€™s also important that the funding to enforce these rules are available to DEQ and the OHA.

Please know I stand behind Clean Corvallis Airâ€™s recommendations. Marilyn, who heads this up, has done in-depth analysis and study of air quality. The requests they are making are reasonable and honoring of all. Please consider all of the particulars that are being mentioned by this group.

Jessica ,Applegate,applegatebrown@msn.com,Eastside Portland Air Coaltion,Oregon,"Citizens need to know what they are breathing.

What happened in Portland around the Bullseye neighborhood just exemplified what is happening all over the state. The Bullseye neighborhood should not be the only neighborhood protected from pollution. All of Oregon deserves the same protections. 

Their is a false narrative around loss of jobs and the harm to the economy. The data disputes that argument. 

A thriving economy and regulations that protect human health are not at odds. Both the EPA and the World Health Organization have shown that every dollar spent on pollution prevention and control renders at least a thirty dollar savings for the economy. Industry lobbyists will mistakenly argue that increased regulatory costs will put industries out of business or drive them from Oregon. This is a myth. The benefits to public health costs, business innovation, decreased pollution mitigation costs, etc. far exceed the costs of cleaning up the air.

Cleaner Air Oregon is an absolute necessity and will put Oregon at least on par with much of the rest of the country in terms of air toxics regulations. California, with one of the most thriving economies in the country has some of the strictest regulations. Regulation and economic hardship do not go hand in hand.

Some other form of rule, like a straight line diminimus and emission limit would be easier and still meet clean air standards.  

The costs you've established/assumed are not realistic for either the consultants, the modelling, or the control equipment.  Doing a full cost analysis survey would give you a better idea of the impact you will have on businesses.  Let them spend their money on a $50,000 bag house instead of modelling.

The consequences to the community of this, and other forms of air pollution, are much greater than the cost of reducing them.

I wish to speak to the rules and rulemaking process involved with the ""Cleaner Air Oregon initiative proposed by the Governor and now in the rule making process.  The rules as proposed are so weakened by industry lobbying and political lack of will to protect the public health and well being (the very reason for the initiative in the first place) that comments from me only helps legitimize a process that is totally compromised so as to give lip service to the motivations behind the initiative and actually gut its content bowing shamefully to industry ""concerns"".  The public has been hoodwinked as has been the standard operating procedure of DEQ for decades with the resulting predictable environmental disasters and public health catastrophes. The standards proposed in the new rules fall well below the standards of many other states and do not protect the public.  Escape clauses that allow the Director to override those standards make the process totally vulnerable to political (industry) pressure.  The public meetings and feedback opportunities are simply a cynical attempt to promote the false notion that the public has a voice in these decisions.  That notion is false.

Unlike smoking, air pollution affects everyone- children, the elderly, asthma sufferers, and those with emphysema.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

I attended the Senate hearing held last spring and was frustrated to see that only construction industry testimony was taken.  As an architect who must spend my work days around diesel operated equipment, a mother who sent her child to school on smelly buses and now as a full time caregiver to my husband, recently diagnosed with a blood cancer related to his exposure to benzene, an additive in gasoline, I want stricter regulations of all trucks, buses and construction equipment.  

It's far easier to begin to regulate these changes now, in a bullish economy than in an economy with uncertainty.  Asking industries to clean up their equipment, while difficult financially, will also be good for their workforces and will lower the incidence of disease.

Please do something and work to regulate the air for the little guys in this state.

Sincerely,
Celeste Lewis

Jen,Davis,cumulous111@icloud.com,Bee Friendly Portland,OR,"Hello, I support all of Eastside Portland Air Coalitionâ€™s comments for changes to the rules.  

But further, I would like you to do more work studying the effects of pollution on plant tissue, not just through uptake in soils.  

Also, please expand your research into health effects from air-pollution so you can better identify victims of pollution for redress. 

Here is the explanation for these suggested changes: have given birth to and raised both of my children just l8 blocks from Bullseye Glass. 

For decades I have grown 16 kinds of fruits and many of my familyâ€™s veggies in our yard. A few days after learning moss on my trees contained very high levels of arsenic and cadmuim, I immediately tested my soil and garden greens, using techniques recommended by OSU and at a certified lab.  

The results were very concerning- my organically amended soil was normal according to prescribed safe levels by the DEQ, but my garden greens came back at unsafe levels for cadmium and lead, according to the standards of the state of CA and the WHO.

 This has been explained to me by a plant pathologist from Cornell who specialized in the effects of pollution on plants, Dr. Bob Amundsen.  Dr. Amundsen has found that aerosolized particulates Of heavy metals can become embedded in plant stomata through respiration- just as the rootless moss breathed in these particulates. I have an older child who has suffered lifelong from serious asthma and who has developed a heart problem called Postural Orthostatic Tachyardia, or POTS syndrome.  

POTS can be caused by alcoholism, lupus and a few other factors for which he has been tested and does not have - the only causative agent left likely was his exposure to aerosolized particulates Of heavy metals on a daily basis in our neighborhood, as well as through his diet from my garden greens. 

POTS is a chronic syndrome for which there is no cure and can be very debilitating.  It is characterized by super rapid heartbeat, fatigue, dizziness, fainting, and nausea. 
My 20 year old kid now has a walker to help him cross his school campus because it is exhausting and he often feels like fainting.  

I truly hope you will work vigorously to tighten regulations for our kids who are the living filters for industry pollution. 

Thank you.

I personally live very close  to Precision Castparts. I understand that there has been more communication between the corporation and the community, but I don't believe that there has been sufficient monitoring of their emissions. How can we feel safe if there are no guarantees that nickel and chromium from their industry are not in our air.

I have been a resident of Portland for 25 years and my friends, family, and I have suffered under the governmentâ€™s decision to prioritize industry above individual citizens for too long.  I have friends in communities in Portland that have multiple polluting facilities within a 1-mile radius. 

Based on my understanding of the current draft rules, the agencies are proposing an area cap for heavily polluted areas, which would restrict new facilities and may require some pollution reduction from some existing facilities.  This does not go far enough.  In addition to preventing any new facilities, these rules must require pollution reductions from all existing facilities until heavily polluted areas are safe. Only such a requirement will ensure that all communities are safe and healthy for all Oregonians.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

I've lived in Oregon for almost two decades. However, it wasn't until a few years ago that it came to my attention that our air is really bad. I don't wish to see us counted amongst the dirtiest air regions in the country, let alone in the world. This idea is radically opposed to the vision of Oregon and the PNW as beautiful natural area that we all take pride in and invite others to come and enjoy. Just take the example of wild fires that raised the scepter of bad air over the region recently. It kept people indoors and had them wearing masks. This affects our day to day life and economy. While those are isolated and seasonal incidents, I don't wish to see them as normal, which is what would happen if we don't clean up our air.

Madeline,Pruett,madelinejlee@gmail.com,PHA community advisory committee,OR,"As a parent of two small children living near the Bullseye factory, near the rail yard, and near the cement plant, I fear site/business specific regulations will not take into account the cumulative health impact of an industrial zone on neighboring communities. It matters that factory air pollutants and diesel truck exhaust are emitted on adjoining properties to the infants in the daycare across the street.  I share the concerns of the EPAC:
What needs to be added or changed
in the Cleaner Air Oregon proposal:
â€¢ Include mobile sources of air toxics such as
diesel particulate in cumulative risk
assessments. Unfiltered industrial trucks
are illegal in California but allowed in
Oregon. Multnomah is among the worst
1% of Counties for diesel particulate
exposure according to the EPA.
â€¢ Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous
health impacts) of 1 at all risk levels.
Where scientific uncertainty or a lack of
research applies, health protective
regulations must err on the side of caution.
â€¢ Eliminate the DEQ Alternate Noncancer Risk
Action Level (ANRAL) and Directors'
Consultation loopholes.
â€¢ Include risk-based concentration
averaging after 1-hour of exposure to a
toxic. In some cases a 24-hour risk action
trigger may be too late.
â€¢ Consult these organizations with
considerations:
ïƒ¼ CalEPA - when setting health risk-based
concentrations
ïƒ¼ EPA Integrated Risk Information System
- being mindful of out-dated science
ïƒ¼ DEQ Air Toxics Science Advisory
Committee - but with skepticism
â€¢ Eliminate the Tiered Implementation
language from the rules. CAO should
apply to all companies upon adoption,
require immediate action, and not be
artificially restricted by agency funding
and resources.
â€¢ Offer a loan program for smaller
companies who may be financially
challenged by compliance.
â€¢ Include a Citizen Enforcement Clause in
the event that DEQ is unable or unwilling
to enforce the rules.
â€¢ Make the Emissions Inventory publicly
available in a user-friendly data base.
@EastsidePDXAir

Scientific research on industrial toxins is
incomplete. Toxic chemicals are rarely shown
to be ""not as bad"" as once thought. For
industries to anticipate this trend, our
regulatory agencies need sufficient public
comment to err on the side of caution.",

I have lived in North Portland neighborhoods since 1995 and currently own a home in East St. Johns, purchased 5 years ago.  I live on the same street as Columbia Steel and just north of Columbia Blvd. I'm an avid gardener and dog walker - so outside year round - and am concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. There are many days when I report burning metal odors, I still don't know what I'm smelling, and I'm also concerned about diesel truck activity on Columbia and how it will affect the health of myself and my neighbors. Not to mention the now almost daily stench of the water treatment plant.

Oregon can't ignore that since we chose to increase the population of our cities and protect the urban growth boundary - which I support - we must do more to protect citizen's health instead of only protecting the interests of industry,

Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to use our pioneering spirit to protect and improve air quality in a city where the line between residential and industrial often blurs, neighborhood by neighborhood. 

I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

Cancer is caused from pollutants, but not necessarily from a single source all of the time, more probably from multiple source when in a diluted form and with time the accumulation will cause chromosome damage and cancers. Indeed I myself just had a biopsy just yesterday because of a lump in my left breast and I am a male.

,Hillman,traceytrix@gmail.com,Self,OREGON,"Dear DEQ,
As has been widely reported, Portland, Oregon has been ranked among the worst in the nation for air quality according to a 2011 EPA study released in 2015. Further, Multnomah ranks among the worst counties in the nation for diesel particulates, which have been linked to Alzheimerâ€™s, obesity, heart defects, and cancers.

Your new rules begin to address this situation- thank you. But you MUST get tougher:

1. All facilities, new and existing, must be regulated the same for strict adherence to healthy air standards. Further, your rules need to be re-written to be comprehensible to all people, to avoid loopholes.  

2. Unfiltered industrial trucks are legal here but not in CA. This is absurd, as diesel filters are quite affordable for large trucking operations and SAVE LIVES..

â€œExposure to diesel engine emissions is associated with chronic bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and in 2012 diesel emissions were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen in humans.  Given the health effects of diesel emissions and ubiquitous environmental exposures, reducing engine emissions has become a public health priority.â€&#65533;
http://journals.lww.com/joem/Pages/ArticleViewer.aspx...
See https://www.sciencedaily.com/rel.../2012/07/120719132945.htm for more info.

3. Eliminate loopholes in your rules, giving wide discretion to â€œDirectorâ€™s Consultationsâ€&#65533; which opens the door to possible corruption, and the â€œAlternate Noncancer Risk Action Level (ANRAL).â€&#65533; Science shows that air pollution causes many more debilitating illnesses than just asthma and cancers.

4. Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 at ALL risk levels. It has been well documented that our understanding of the toxicity of air-pollutants has been widely underestimated, and as new scientific findings continue to develop, we must err on side of caution.

5. Donâ€™t allow industry to claim they will suffer for protecting human health. We taxpayers pay millions annually for health concerns created or exacerbated by pollution, and industry is subsidized by our dollars. Meanwhile, Oregon industries continue to pay some of the lowest taxes in the nation.

6. Keep all citizens apprised with information about pollution in their area with more than a website or an email. Folks should receive PAPER NOTICES via mail or as door fliers. Not everyone has internet access.

7. Do deeper research with plant pathologists into the impacts of aerosolised particulates on plants. Urban gardeners need to know if they are growing safe food or not.   

8.  And MAKE SURE every community and every non-English speaking group has access to your info on polluters, and have opportunities to speak out on these concerns.  DEQ should send relevant meeting fliers home with kids at all affected schools.  All DEQ Community meetings should be at schools and community centers, NOT at the convention center or PCC where parking is difficult and not free. 

Our health, economy, live-ability, tourist industry, and natural resources upon which we all depend are at serious risk from toxic air pollution. Please take a brave stand to clean up the air we all must breathe. We will support you.

I live with my grandchildren in Portland. For some time I've been aware of how polluted our air is, and it's a great concern for me. I'm sure you are aware of statistics on the burden on Portland's health (respiratory illnesses, cancers) of the high levels of air pollution we are exposed to. The loose standards for truck emissions are a big part of the problem. I live near a major through-street which has heavy truck traffic. The smell of diesel fuel and the dirty soot which settles on every surface is just the visible part of the problem.

Oregonâ€™s regulations protect the interests of industry, not the health of its residents.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

Re the diesel issue: 

I am appalled that Oregon has knowingly imported school buses from  other states,  which had discontinued using those buses because of  their toxic diesel emissions.  Diesel is a carcinogen! Our children and all Oregonians need to be protected from those fumes as well! 
During her last town hall meeting Speaker Kotek called Portland "" the ground zero for air pollution"". 

When are our legislators and State agencies going to step up to the plate to protect the general public, themselves and their loved ones, from breathing toxic fumes which pollute our lungs and bodies, causing asthma, cancer, and a host of other illnesses. 

It's way past time Oregon catches up with states such as Washington and California, who have been successful in curbing air pollution.

As someone who lives in N Portland  and has attended meetings re air pollution in our area,   I have been continuously appalled at DEQ's   lack of concern for public health issues brought up during those meetings, as well as their extreme disregard for their own rules and regulations pertaining to industry polluters.

One example is that DEQ did not have a problem continuing to issue  permits to operate to one of the polluters.  This polluter, ELR, ( formerly APES) operated for years after illegally  having removed  their limited safety equipment,  which was designed to protect the public from breathing their carcinogenic exhaust . This with DEQ knowledge. Thereby putting the public at risk for numerous respiratory illnesses, including cancer. 

I strongly suggest putting regulations in place to prevent this blatant cooperation between industry and regulatory agencies, to the detriment of public health.

Technically, then, it should no longer be called â€œused oilâ€&#65533; because itâ€™s been turned into fuel. (ie. low grade diesel, etc.) 

All these different stratified grades of contaminated industrial fuel are being burned up with exhaust fumes going directly into the air shed under Oregonâ€™s â€œused oilâ€&#65533; exemption. That exemption is the dangerous loophole that allows these oil refiners to pollute our environment and endanger our lives. 

The exception is supposed to be for used oil â€”not for processed, dirty fuel. But DEQ and lawmakers continue to be either hoodwinked or they are ignoring the consequences of subjecting citizens and the environment to the dangerous burning of millions of gallons of dirty fuels from a stationary source. This is a far greater air quality problem in Oregon than diesel emissions from trucks and this kind of fuel burning is not allowed in other states.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

Two years ago, my two-year-old son Merlin and I joined our neighbors from inner southeast Portland to deliver vegetables grown in our backyards to the Oregon DEQ office, as part of the request that Bullseye Glass mitigate its excessive emissions of heavy metal pollution into our local atmosphere. Merlin carried a big turnip, and chanted ""clean air now!"" in his unusually articulate baby voice. This September, Merlin was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He died less than two weeks later from a sudden, massive infection. Despite cautious, health-conscious parenting and excellent medical care, his immune system had been rendered completely ineffective from the leukemia (and chemotherapy as well). 

I understand that the medical community has no certainty about what causes childhood leukemia. But as a grieving parent, I have to look at what is around me, what I could have done and what could be done in my community to prevent this tremendous loss. One of the things I see is the black layer of particulate pollution that gathers on the surfaces outside my home. I consider the diesel train engines and the trucks traveling on the nearby highways, the small-scale industry in my neighborhood that I love, and I feel very, very sorry. I would like the immune systems of Oregon's children to have a better chance to grow strong and healthy, in cleaner air than that which we breathe now. I strongly support ""area cap"" monitoring of traffic, construction, and train emissions in addition to the monitoring of industrial facilities.

Please act with all urgency to implement the very strictest provisions to protect health and environment over profits.  Oregon should lead the nation in the very strongest air protections, as we will all surely benefit from the results.  Please strengthen the proposed Cleaner Air Oregon proposal with these provisions:

Include mobile sources of air toxics such as diesel particulate in cumulative risk assessments
. Unfiltered industrial trucks are illegal in California but allowed in Oregon. 
Multnomah is among the worst 1% of Counties for diesel particulate exposure according to the EPA.
â€¢Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 at all risk levels. Where scientific uncertainty or a lack of research applies, health protective regulations must err on the side of caution.
â€¢Eliminate the DEQ Alternate Noncancer Risk  Action Level
(ANRAL)  and Directors' Consultation loopholes.
â€¢Include risk-based concentration averaging after 1-hour of exposure to a toxic. In some cases a  24-hour risk action trigger may be too late.
â€¢Consult these organizations with considerations:
ïƒ¼CalEPA -when setting health risk-based concentrations
ïƒ¼EPA Integrated Risk Information System - being mindful of out-dated science 
DEQ Air Toxics Science Advisory Committee-  but with skepticism
â€¢Eliminate the Tiered Implementation language from the rules. CAO should 
apply to all companies upon adoption, require immediate action, and not be 
artificially restricted by agency funding and resources.
â€¢Offer a loan program for smaller companies who may be financially 
challenged by compliance.

Luke ,Mecham,Luke.Mecham@providence.org,Providence Portland Medical Center,Oregon,"1)   The affordable and simple Level 1 analysis is not â€œallowedâ€&#65533; for a facility that has fugitive emissions.  Hospitals have fugitive emissions from our buildings from use of isopropyl alcohol and other toxic chemicals.  They are toxic because disinfection is a critical function for hospitals.  Product substitution is not an option for hospitals.  Not allowing sites with fugitive emissions to use Level 1 automatically bumps hospitals into a more expensive Risk Assessment approach.  
2)      This rule proposes that facilities take production limits where they cannot demonstrate acceptable risk levels.  This could mean that we are required to take a limit on the amount of fuel oil combusted in our boilers.  Fuel oil limits are not a feasible option for us because the hospital needs the ability to operate during any curtailment of natural gas. The draft rule does not make any allowances for backup fuels used only on rare occasions.  Under the draft rule we may have to install emission controls for oil firing to maintain the necessary flexibility to operate. This in turn would add cost to healthcare. 
3)      The rule is not clear about locations to assess the impact to the â€œpublic.â€&#65533;  Manufacturing facilities have the luxury of drawing a boundary around their fence-line and their toxic concentrations within their facility do not matter.  A hospital has â€œpublicâ€&#65533; access on-site within buildings, sitting on outdoor benches, and in parking lots.  The boilers and emergency generators are typically located very close to these public access areas.  The lack of dispersion distance means the calculated risk levels will be higher. We request that the rule clearly require risk assessment be performed at the property boundary of each facility.  The public choosing to visit or use the services of a facility should accept the risk exposure encountered on site from the fuel combustion and chemical use required to operate the facility.
4)      Our highest risk emissions â€“ firing of diesel engines (emergency generators) and diesel oil boilers â€“ are for the sole purpose of providing critical power and warmth when loss of our primary, clean fuel is not available.  It is not safe to take operational limits on these emission units which exist for the purpose of saving lives.  For this purpose we would request an exemption from the risk assessment requirements for loss of primary fuel or power.
5)      We would request that hospitals be exempt from this rule entirely.  The Risk Assessments and permitting could cost several hundred thousand dollars.  It may not actually result in reductions in emissions or risk, and those costs will increase healthcare costs to the public without decreasing risk in appreciable fashion. Risk is inherent in some of the operations performed by hospitals, but the minimal potential health risks to the community surrounding a hospital site from fuel or chemical use on the site are far outweighed by the health benefits provided to a community by the healthcare services provided.  It is not appropriate to apply such a rule to medical facilities.  It could disproportionally penalize hospitals in urban areas with a tight campus â€œfootprintâ€&#65533; versus hospitals in more rural or suburban areas on larger properties.
",
Michael,Prager,mprager@alum.mit.edu,private citizen,Oregon,"I cannot comment on the absolute risk levels, but I do believe that the proposed new rules will constitute a considerable step forward. Still, I am baffled that everything proposed seems to require industry to identify, monitor, and correct problems and potential problems, without government monitoring or enforcement. It makes no sense to have industry responsible for its own issues or potential issues. An arrangement more likely to make sense would also involve fees to potentially polluting industry that would be retained by DEQ and used for monitoring, analysis, and enforcement. The fees should be large enough to fund a program what will ensure good, clean air for all Oregonians. Fees should be supplemented by far more aggressive fines for noncompliance.",

 In my working class neighborhood, the railroad has been allowed to use our small street as a truck route for their intermodal operations which they moved to the Brooklyn rail yard several years ago.  Most intermodal operations in cities are on the outskirts of town. Most of the traffic is from their contracted truckers moving containers on trailers from one end of their yard to the other surplus yard. They're using our publicly funded road as their own private route instead of fixing the issue on their own property. The air quality has deteriorated significantly since they began as have our property values and quality of life. We can no longer use our front porches and yards or keep our windows open in the summer. The soot from diesel particulates, tires, etc. covers our windowsills.

I was appalled to hear that the bill cutting down on diesel exhaust is all but eliminated. I had hoped that the public health of Oregonians is more important than the wealth of industry.

My wife and I moved here 12 years ago, thinking like so many that OR is a healthy place with focus on greenery, alternative transport and front yard veggie gardens and chickens.  Little did we know that air pollution is allowed here in much greater quantities than in most other states. Be it diesel exhaust from school buses bought after other states rejected them, or extremely lax and negligent oversight of industry practices with regards to filters and other devices that curb industry pollution, as discovered recently on Hayden island. It's unimaginable that this is allowed! Some if not most of these toxins are known carcinogens and a grave danger to our health.

From an article in the Portland Tribune, March 2016: Our air in certain Portland areas  is so bad it ranks in the top .1 % nationally for it's potential to cause cancer. 
If you and your loved ones live here this counts you in as well! Public Health over Industry Wealth! Thank you.

 I'm a resident of Portland, Oregon, in the Kenton neighborhood. For over 11 years, the APES facility has  generated and stored toxic and noxious materials which pollute both the air and the soil in my neighborhood.

For the entirety of that time, Portland's DEQ has turned a blind eye to the pollution levels  generated by that business, and has ignored the health and safety concerns of the surrounding area.  The DEQ's consistent oversight has resulted in an increase in toxicity in my neighborhood, and perpetuated a systemic disregard for the enforcement of local industrial toxic emission standards.

 To  remediate these  issues with the DEQ, and likely those of other relevant agencies, the Cleaner Air Oregon program  has outlined a thorough set of requirements and steps.

As has been widely reported, Portland, Oregon has been ranked among the worst in the nation for air quality according to a 2011 EPA study released in 2015. Further, Multnomah ranks among the worst counties in the nation for diesel particulates, which have been linked to Alzheimerâ€™s, obesity, heart defects, and cancers.
Your new rules begin to address this situation- thank you. But you MUST get tougher:
1. All facilities, new and existing, must be regulated the same for strict adherence to healthy air standards. Further, your rules need to be re-written to be comprehensible to all people, to avoid loopholes.
2. Unfiltered industrial trucks are legal here but not in CA. This is absurd, as diesel filters are quite affordable for large trucking operations and SAVE LIVES..
â€œExposure to diesel engine emissions is associated with chronic bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and in 2012 diesel emissions were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen in humans. Given the health effects of diesel emissions and ubiquitous environmental exposures, reducing engine emissions has become a public health priority.â€&#65533;

See https://www.sciencedaily.com/rel.../2012/07/120719132945.htm for more info.
3. Eliminate loopholes in your rules, giving wide discretion to â€œDirectorâ€™s Consultationsâ€&#65533; which opens the door to possible corruption, and the â€œAlternate Noncancer Risk Action Level (ANRAL).â€&#65533; Science shows that air pollution causes many more debilitating illnesses than just asthma and cancers.
4. Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 at ALL risk levels. It has been well documented that our understanding of the toxicity of air-pollutants has been widely underestimated, and as new scientific findings continue to develop, we must err on side of caution.
5. Donâ€™t allow industry to claim they will suffer for protecting human health. We taxpayers pay millions annually for health concerns created or exacerbated by pollution, and industry is subsidized by our dollars. Meanwhile, Oregon industries continue to pay some of the lowest taxes in the nation.
6. Keep all citizens apprised with information about pollution in their area with more than a website or an email. Folks should receive PAPER NOTICES via mail or as door fliers. Not everyone has internet access.
7. Do deeper research with plant pathologists into the impacts of aerosolised particulates on plants. Urban gardeners need to know if they are growing safe food or not.
8. And MAKE SURE every community and every non-English speaking group has access to your info on polluters, and have opportunities to speak out on these concerns. DEQ should send relevant meeting fliers home with kids at all affected schools. All DEQ Community meetings should be at schools and community centers, NOT at the convention center or PCC where parking is difficult and not free.

Vivian,Christensen,vivianchristensen.pdx@gmail.com,N/A,Oregon ,"My family resides in an environmental hot spot.  We live in Southeast Portland in a neighborhood that sits between a group of large-scale industrial facilities to the south and Brooklyn Yard (a truck to train transfer facility) to the north. Residents in my neighborhood are exposed to toxins such as nickel, hexavalent chromium, styrene, and increasing amounts of diesel. In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts, based on Toxic Release Inventory Data, found that my neighborhood school, Duniway Elementary, ranked in the 3rd highest percentile of exposure to toxins. Put another way, of approximately 128,000 schools in the United States that were examined, only 3,000 schools have worse air quality. 

Since the study, little has changed.  The stateâ€™s regulatory framework has been guided by industry, with no caps on the toxins that can be emitted into neighboring communities.  In the metals emissions update on September 8, 2016, the DEQ reported that at the Springwater Trail monitor - nickel concentrations were over 3.4 times benchmark and hexavalent chromium concentrations were over 4.1 times benchmark â€“ this is after emissions controls were installed by Precision Castparts.  In addition, residential neighborhoods near Brooklyn Yard have seen a significant increase of intrastate truck traffic. On a daily basis, my family is exposed to unregulated diesel exhaust from semi-trucks that travel less than a block from my house.  Most of these trucks are no longer legal in California and Washington due to their heavy pollution.   

I am writing to you because members of my community, and those living in similar communities heavily impacted by industrial emissions, need DEQâ€™s help to ensure that Cleaner Air Oregon will do what the Governor promised â€“ clean up Oregonâ€™s toxic air.  The EPA considers one excess cancer per million people and acceptable risk.  Putting a cap on 500 cancers per million people is NOT what most would call â€œhealth-based regulation.â€&#65533;  This is basically business as usual and does very little to help those who have shouldered the burden of Oregonâ€™s unregulated industrial legacy.  Allowing many older industrial facilities to continue emitting toxins into surrounding neighborhoods while regulating new facilities does nothing to help communities that have suffered the devastating health effects of exposure to toxins for decades due to our state governmentâ€™s disregard for human health.  These industry giveaways show a continued indifference towards the communities that need health-based regulatory reform the most.  

In order for Cleaner Air Oregon to be truly meaningful, emissions from ALL facilities and diesel emissions from unregulated semi-trucks must be addressed. 

I shouldnâ€™t have to worry that I, or someone I care about, may get sick from exposure to toxins, or if my sonâ€™s asthma is a result of air pollution, but I do.  In fact, I think about it a lot.  I often wonder if living in Portland was a bad choice for my family, and if perhaps we should move elsewhere â€“ somewhere where industry isnâ€™t free to release dangerous toxins into the air, water, and soil and regulations are designed and enforced for the health and safety of neighboring communities.  

I am asking the DEQ to do the right thing and finally put the health of Oregonians living near pollution sources before industry profit.  Oregon has the chance to become a leader in designing and implementing a truly rigorous health-based environmental regulatory framework. Families like mine are counting in it.

Further, Multnomah ranks among the worst counties in the nation for diesel particulates, which have been linked to Alzheimerâ€™s, obesity, heart defects, and cancers.

Your new rules begin to address this situation- thank you. But you MUST get tougher:

1. All facilities, new and existing, must be regulated the same for strict adherence to healthy air standards. Further, your rules need to be re-written to be comprehensible to all people, to avoid loopholes.

2. Unfiltered industrial trucks are legal here but not in CA. This is absurd, as diesel filters are quite affordable for large trucking operations and SAVE LIVES..

â€œExposure to diesel engine emissions is associated with chronic bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and in 2012 diesel emissions were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen in humans. Given the health effects of diesel emissions and ubiquitous environmental exposures, reducing engine emissions has become a public health priority.â€&#65533;

3. Eliminate loopholes in your rules, giving wide discretion to â€œDirectorâ€™s Consultationsâ€&#65533; which opens the door to possible corruption, and the â€œAlternate Noncancer Risk Action Level (ANRAL).â€&#65533; Science shows that air pollution causes many more debilitating illnesses than just asthma and cancers.

4. Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 at ALL risk levels. It has been well documented that our understanding of the toxicity of air-pollutants has been widely underestimated, and as new scientific findings continue to develop, we must err on side of caution.

5. Donâ€™t allow industry to claim they will suffer for protecting human health. We taxpayers pay millions annually for health concerns created or exacerbated by pollution, and industry is subsidized by our dollars. Meanwhile, Oregon industries continue to pay some of the lowest taxes in the nation.

6. Keep all citizens apprised with information about pollution in their area with more than a website or an email. Folks should receive PAPER NOTICES via mail or as door fliers. Not everyone has internet access.

7. Do deeper research with plant pathologists into the impacts of aerosolised particulates on plants. Urban gardeners need to know if they are growing safe food or not.

8. And MAKE SURE every community and every non-English speaking group has access to your info on polluters, and have opportunities to speak out on these concerns. DEQ should send relevant meeting fliers home with kids at all affected schools. All DEQ Community meetings should be at schools and community centers, NOT at the convention center or PCC where parking is difficult and not free.

Our health, economy, live-ability, tourist industry, and natural resources upon which we all depend are at serious risk from toxic air pollution. Please take a brave stand to clean up the air we all must breathe. We will support you.

Krystal,Abrams,kabrams@beyondtoxics.org,Beyond Toxics,Oregon,"Thank you for the great work you are doing with Cleaner Air Oregon. I wholeheartedly support adopting CAO's health-based regulations to protect people and our environment from toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers per1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Jan,Zuckerman,ses_janz@yahoo.com,Mrs.,OR,"Thank you for your commitment to put the health of the people of Oregon before industry.  We can and deserve to have both a healthy economy and healthy population.  I have lived in Portland for the last 42 years and have been teaching here for over 30 years.  In the past 10 years  I have seen a rise in the amount of children who come to school sick with respiratory illnesses.  My daughter, an ED nurse at Legacy Emmanuel, has seen a rise in respiratory illnesses also. My sister and her husband can no longer visit Portland because the last two times, my brother-in-law ended up in the emergency room with severe asthma attacks that were life threatening.   The myth that Portland is green was shattered when my sister said that she could no longer visit. 
Because of this, I am EXTREMELY concerned that the DEQ's proposal to measure and cap air pollution will not be effective without including traffic and construction diesel emissions.  My students living in SE Portland are getting sick from the  unregulated construction that is happening all around them.  I don't suffer from respiratory illness, but feel the impacts of construction in my neighborhood in NE Portland.
I am also deeply concerned that capping 500 cancers per million people per facility will not create incentives to improve or come up with any kind of innovative ways to cut back emissions.  The combination of this kind cap and cumulative risk of unregulated construction and industry is disproportionately harming the most vulnerable populations in Portland.  It truly is criminal.  Cleaner Air Oregon should be CLEAN AIR OREGON.  We  should be ashamed of ourselves that we don't care enough about people and animals to keep our air clean.  All industry, existing and new facilities must be held accountable to put people before profits.  As the Department of Environmental Quality, I hope you will uphold the promise to put communities first and make Oregon truly ""green"", not just lining the pockets of industry with green money.
Thank you.",
Emily,Lethenstrom,emojean@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. It is astounding to me that Oregonian is a laggard in clean air regulations compared to our neighboring states of California and Washington. Oregonians deserve better!   

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.
 
Lastly, it is the responsibility of the agency to meaningfully engage community members and that includes providing accessible information, translation, and childcare services at community engagement opportunities and events.

Kevin,Kaufman,kevinkaufman@comcast.net,,OR,"Dear DEQ, 

According to Upstream Research, my neighborhood ranks in the 93rd percentile for airborne cancer risk for the entire country.   This is totally unacceptable.   Oregon finally has the chance to enact meaningful environmental policy that protects human health over short-term corporate profit.  I urge you to take the following considerations when drafting the final Cleaner Air Oregon regulations:  1) ALL facilities must be included in a strict, health-based, enforceable air quality standard.  Allowing older industrial facilities to continue polluting at current levels leaves communities that have suffered the devastating health effects of exposure to toxins for decades with no additional protection.  2) New regulations must be enforced immediately.  We simply canâ€™t wait any longer.  3) Unfiltered diesel must be included in the DEQâ€™s new regulatory framework.  As you are well aware, Multnomah County is among the worst in the COUNTRY for air quality.  Without the inclusion of diesel, Cleaner Air Oregon will not live up to its promise of solving Oregonâ€™s air pollution crisis.  4) DEQ must employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 for ALL risk levels.  Anything else is unacceptable.  Parkinsonâ€™s disease, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, heart disease, and asthma are just a few examples of chronic diseases that have strong associations to environmental exposures.  Putting a cap on 500 cancers per million people is disingenuous and does nothing to protect the very people that have suffered for decades because of our stateâ€™s disregard for human health.   

The claim that stricter environmental regulations will result in job loss is a tired narrative that has been proven false.   The federal Office of Management and Budget found that air pollution regulation benefits often exceed costs by a 10 to 1 ratio.Â  Currently, Oregonians are shouldering the pubic health costs of air pollution at an estimated cost of over three billion dollars a year based on US EPA calculations for diesel emissions alone. Â California has some of the strictest regulations in the country, yet they have a booming economy.  Does Oregon really want to be a dumping ground for industries that can no longer do business elsewhere?  Itâ€™s time for Oregon step up and become a leader in designing, implementing, and enforcing health-based environmental regulations. 

Sincerely, 
Kevin Kaufman

I care about our air quality and want to see a future of cleaner air for Oregon, however, the DEQâ€™s proposed rules are too broad.  They are not based on science, and the push seems to be political.  It is an experiment that could result in the closures of many businesses and the end of many jobs.  The costs, and detrimental effects these rules would have on our local economy, must be considered before moving forward.   I ask that the DEQ re-evaluate the rules and work cooperatively with Oregon Companies to reach more informed decisions in this regard.",
Rick,McNern,rickmcn2@gmail.com,,Oregon,"1) End averaging of particulate sizes for determining pollution remedies.  For example, one of the H + V fiberglass plants on Crystal Lake in Corvallis produces 1-3 micron sized particulates,  which are more dangerous than larger sizes,  and which will be unaffected  by the proposed filter,  which will only capture particulates over 3 microns.  Averaging with the other plant (100 yards away) which produces 12 micron sized particulates does not change this.
2) Promote citizen monitoring of emissions to find  plants under-reporting their emissions.  The above mentioned fiberglass plants were fined two years ago for understating their pollution over the previous five year period.  Yet the remedy for the permit now required does not fix the problem,  and you are counting on them to report their own emissions.
3) Exempting plants with under 50 employees makes no sense in an age of automation.
4) It does not appear that much is being done to reduce diesel emissions.  California provides many examples of systems to prevent the release of emissions at filling stations.  How can an air pollution proposal completely ignore cars, trucks, motorized equipment, and the burning of gasses?",

As has been widely reported, Portland, Oregon has been ranked among the worst in the nation for air quality according to a 2011 EPA study released in 2015. Further, Multnomah ranks among the worst counties in the nation for diesel particulates, which have been linked to Alzheimerâ€™s, obesity, heart defects, and cancers.
Your new rules begin to address this situation- thank you. But you MUST get tougher:
1. All facilities, new and existing, must be regulated the same for strict adherence to healthy air standards. Further, your rules need to be re-written to be comprehensible to all people, to avoid loopholes. 
2. Unfiltered industrial trucks are legal here but not in CA. This is absurd, as diesel filters are quite affordable for large trucking operations and SAVE LIVES..
â€œExposure to diesel engine emissions is associated with chronic bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and in 2012 diesel emissions were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen in humans. Given the health effects of diesel emissions and ubiquitous environmental exposures, reducing engine emissions has become a public health priority.â€&#65533;
http://journals.lww.com/joem/Pages/ArticleViewer.aspx...
3. Eliminate loopholes in your rules, giving wide discretion to â€œDirectorâ€™s Consultationsâ€&#65533; which opens the door to possible corruption, and the â€œAlternate Noncancer Risk Action Level (ANRAL).â€&#65533; Science shows that air pollution causes many more debilitating illnesses than just asthma and cancers.
4. Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 at ALL risk levels. It has been well documented that our understanding of the toxicity of air-pollutants has been widely underestimated, and as new scientific findings continue to develop, we must err on side of caution.
5. Donâ€™t allow industry to claim they will suffer for protecting human health. We taxpayers pay millions annually for health concerns created or exacerbated by pollution, and industry is subsidized by our dollars. Meanwhile, Oregon industries continue to pay some of the lowest taxes in the nation.
6. Keep all citizens apprised with information about pollution in their area with more than a website or an email. Folks should receive PAPER NOTICES via mail or as door fliers. Not everyone has internet access.
7. Do deeper research with plant pathologists into the impacts of aerosolised particulates on plants. Urban gardeners need to know if they are growing safe food or not. 
8. And MAKE SURE every community and every non-English speaking group has access to your info on polluters, and have opportunities to speak out on these concerns. DEQ should send relevant meeting fliers home with kids at all affected schools. All DEQ Community meetings should be at schools and community centers, NOT at the convention center or PCC where parking is difficult and not free.

Kirsten,Solberg,Kirsten.Etc@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

     I've lived in 6 states, but never had asthma symptoms until moving to Portland in 1998.  I had my first asthma ER visit a year later.  I have been on expensive medications, missed work, had trouble taking care of my children and had bouts of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia due to Portland's toxic air.  Here are some of the reasons we have high rates of asthma, and high rates of missed school and work due to our unacceptably toxic air in the Metro Portland region:
     -While living in NE Portland for 17 years, I regularly cleaned black soot and particulates off my porch.  It isn't as simple to clean those fine, dirty particulates out of my or my children's lungs. 
     -I've learned that Oregon is a dumping ground for dirty diesel trucks, since it is illegal for them to be registered in Washington and California.  The fine particulates are toxic and very harmful for lungs, especially for citizens with lung problems like asthma or COPD, for children, and for economically disadvantages citizens, often minorities, who live near our interstates and major roads. 
     -We have excessive levels of benzene in our air because unlike Washington and California, we don't protect our public air by requiring oil refineries to remove benzene from the Alaskan crude before it is shipped here.  We have benzene levels 75x the EPA recommended level downtown, contributing to increases in cancers, especially blood cancers.
     -Many of our public schools have air quality worse than 99% of the schools in the USA.
     -I would prefer to walk or bike to work or run errands, but because Portland's air quality is so poor and my lungs are vulnerable, I drive instead.  The sad irony that I then contribute to Portland's poor air quality does not escape me.  I want to bike and walk, but until Portland cleans up its air, it's out of the question.
     -Oregon prefers to allow industries to pollute rather than protect the health of its citizens.  It's unacceptable, backward, and it needs to stop.  Anyone who is putting corporate profits over people at state agencies needs to be fired.  
    -My children and I start coughing every Fall when my neighbor starts heating their house with a dirty-burning wood stove and my coughing continued all through the winter.  Dirty burning wood stoves need to be banned.  Many other cities, like Sacramento and Albuquerque have No-Burn days when air quality is poor, but not Portland.
     -I recently moved out of Portland to the suburbs specifically for cleaner air for me and my children.  Since my move, I've been able to reduce my high dose asthma inhaler and my asthma symptoms have improved.  But now I have to drive many more miles every week and spew more exhaust into our air.
     Portland has a reputation for being a ""Green City"", with walkable neighborhoods and light rail.  Unfortunately, our air quality is not part of the ""green"" picture here, due to sources of pollution listed above.  I can't stress enough how strongly I feel about Oregon finally protecting the health of its citizens rather than the profits for trucking corporations and industries.  Rising asthma, cancer and premature birth rates are avoidable and are not healthy for our economy, our children or our workforce.  Air pollution even lowers IQâ€™s and contributes to behavioral problems, contributing further to challenges in our classrooms.
     Sometimes the negative effects of air pollution are immediate, and sometimes the toxins lay dormant in our bodies for 10 to 30 years before a disease is diagnosed.  We are paying a huge financial and health burden while Oregon's regulatory agencies are asleep at the wheel to benefit corporations.  We expect better from Oregon, and prioritizing clean public air and citizen health is long overdue.

Charles,Goodrich,charlesgoodrich34@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear DEQ,
I am writing in support of strong clean air standards in Oregon and a comprehensive, coordinated program for clean-air management.
I urge you to adopt adequate standards for control of all sources of pollution that protect people, especially young people, elderly people and people with health issues such as asthma. I urge you to practice strict enforcement of established rules and regulations and to seek adequate financing for air pollution abatement programs. Our air is a natural resource, the most essential element for life. 
I have a few specific issues with your Draft Rules. 
1. Your timeline to bring all companies under the Cleaner Air Oregon is too long. Only 80 of Oregon's 2,500 companies will be included in the first five years. The Department of Environmental Quality has been sufficiently funded to hire necessary personnel to enact the new rules, or to finish a vital statewide emissions inventory. 
2. The allowable number of cancer deaths from toxic emission from existing factories has been increased from 10 people per million to 500 people per million. Also, the Hazard Index related to chronic non-cancer diseases for existing factories has increased from 1 to 30 for the new rules. These numbers are too high. They are not health-based. Please amend toward the lower,  more conservative numbers. 
These rules must be grounded in science, informed by data. They need to based on a view to optimum health of citizens. Thank you for working to protect our quality of life in Oregon.

It is embarrassing that businesses in Oregon buy the dirty diesel trucks that are no longer allowed in California.  I live in NE Portland close to Highway 30 and the airport where dirty diesel trucks drive and thrive.   Diesel emissions are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream increasing your risk for cancer and heart and lung disease.  And no longer can we count on our trees to be carbon neutral.  This is not a political issue, it's a public health issue!

James,Ofsink,james@ofsink.today,,OR,"I live in SE Portland and closely followed the controversy surrounded Bullseye and other local point-source polluters. My takeaway from attending numerous listening sessions, and hearing from both advocates and industry representatives is that first and foremost industry has a responsibility to not be poisoning our shared ecosystem (air, water, etc.). People deserve to know what we are breathing, and it requires a combination of mandatory disclosure by polluters and also strong independent assessment and auditing by regulators to safeguard the health of our air. We must put human health first in our determinations of what will be allowed to be emitted into the environment, and human health should be valued whether people live in urban areas or rural ones. We need one set of regulations and requirements that standardizes circumstances for the entire state and makes sure every Oregonian can breathe easy knowing that each breath isn't toxic. As far as paying for the programs, I support plans, like those in many parts of the world, that charge polluters for the enforcement and of course hold them accountable for any mitigation required by their actions. A common refrain in our political climate today is that: ""x policy is bad because it will cost employers money and that will lead to losses in jobs."" This is a false narrative, we can have BOTH robust industry and also sustainable industry (as is true in many parts of the world).

Matthew,Whipple,matthew.james.whipple@gmail.com,,OR,"I will heartily endorse what Melody Valdini wrote:

""Please institute more protections on the air we breathe! It is shocking that I need to even request this- it its most basic form, the government exists to protect the health and lives of the citizens, not to prioritize the interests of industry. So to be clear: I am requesting that the DEQ and our state government prioritize the lives of the citizens of Oregon over the industry interests, and thus please use your resources to regulate and monitor the toxins released into our air everyday. We must go above and beyond the minimal federal regulations and instead maximize the regulations that will keep the poison out of our air. Do right by our children and grandchildren- please clean our air!""",
Maya,Herzig,herzig@ohsu.edu,OHSU,OR,"
I believe that Cleaner Air Oregon (CAO) is a step in the right direction towards improving public health. I appreciate the increased transparency and knowledge CAO will provide regarding facilities and air toxic emissions across Oregon. However, I agree with the Washington County Public Health Advisory Council (PHAC) that there are some specific concerns regarding the proposed rules: 1) The current proposed RAL cap of 500 is of public health concern. This cap could mean multiple facilities in an area are not performing emission mitigation or curtailment strategies. This exposes people living, working, or learning near facilities to greater risk of poor health. We recommend maintaining a RAL cap of 100 excess cancer risk per million people. 2) The different standards between existing and new facilities do not support protections for the publicâ€™s health. The public is affected by toxic emissions regardless if it is coming from an existing or new source. Additionally, the ODEQ Director consultation raises concern, and we recommend an alternative, more comprehensive approach requiring the ODEQ Director to work with the Environmental Quality Commission to review cases of facilities emitting beyond their permitted limits to determine appropriate recommendation. 3) People experience air pollution cumulatively from multiple sources and over a lifetime. We are supportive of the area RAL of 75 excess cancer risk per million. Furthermore, ODEQ could strengthen transparency, increase communication, and improve community trust by developing a risk reduction plan for any area that is determined to be above the risk action level. This plan could include notifying people living in these areas and providing information about the steps the agency is taking to reduce risk. Additionally, ODEQ should regularly report to EQC once the first area multi-source risk determination has been made to document progress made reducing risk and the impact on permitting decisions within the area. 4) Finally, we believe a regularly updated emissions inventory is critical to protecting public health, and recommend that the inventory be made publicly available in a user-friendly database.

It also jeopardizes  â€™Georgia-Pacific's ability to continue investing in our rural community as Clatsop Countyâ€™s leading manufacturing employer (nearly 750 jobs and an annual payroll of $72 million).  

These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards should be revised to be more reasonable and more commensurate with the actual risk. Notwithstanding industryâ€™s relatively small contribution to air pollution, DEQ has proposed a costly regulatory program that would do little to improve Oregonâ€™s air at a considerable cost to the state and individual businesses by unnecessarily imposing air toxics thresholds that are many times more stringent than similar programs in other states. The costs to the state and its economy of using such stringent regulatory thresholds far outweigh any identifiable health benefits.

Poorly conceived rules and requirements can have devastating consequences on local businesses. Please consider the impact on our employer, our jobs and our community before finalizing Cleaner Air Oregonâ€™s unnecessary, unjustifiable and burdensome standards. Thank you.

David,Haas,db009haas@gmail.com,Georgia Pacific ,OREGON,"As a union member of United Steelworkers Local 1097 and an employee of the Georgia-Pacific tissue mill in Wauna, Oregon, Iâ€™m proud that my union and my company values our environment, our community and our health. We have a proven record of complying with federal, state and local rules and regulations to protect public and environmental health, including multiple federal rules that already regulate the same sorts of air pollutants that Oregonâ€™s program would.   I work at the facility and see first-hand how seriously USW Local 1097 employees and the company take protecting the environment.

 

The regulatory and financial burden imposed by Cleaner Air Oregon, which would be the strictest in the country, may prevent our facility from making the capital investments needed to maintain our competitiveness. Already, our facility is at a competitive disadvantage to other paper mills in the Midwest and Southern states that have lower energy, wood supply and transportation costs. 

 

Oregon employers, including Georgia-Pacific, already have improved our environment and protected public and employee health by reducing air contaminants. Due to substantial investments in pollution control technology, Oregon industrial sources now account for less than 15 percent of air pollutants.

 

These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards must be revised.  This program is in response to a Portland-area issue and based on unrealistic, hypothetical health outcomes that does not take into account the health impact of job losses on rural Oregon.  Poorly conceived rules and requirements can have devastating consequences on rural Oregon businesses. Please consider the impact on our nearly 750 jobs and our $72 million annual payroll that contribute to rural Oregonâ€™s economy and our rural community before finalizing Cleaner Air Oregonâ€™s unnecessary, unjustifiable, and burdensome standards.

Amy,Vanacore,vivace88@gmail.com,self-employed,Oregon,"I applaud DEQ for taking a step in the right direction, but Cleaner Air Oregon's proposed rules do not go far enough to protect our health. 

Cancer is devastating our families and communities, and businesses that release toxic levels of chemicals into the air should be denied the opportunity to set up shop and continue operating in Oregon.

I support DEQ's proposal to regulate the 80 facilities with the highest health risks first, but this should be done within two years (not five years) after the rules take effect. A lot of damage can be done in five years! Action must be taken more quickly, because people's lives are at stake. 

Also, I urge DEQ to remove the rules that would allow businesses that need to lower their risk more time to comply if they claim financial hardship. This flexibility provided to businesses will hurt more Oregonians. 

We, the people who live here and breathe the air every day, are counting on DEQ to make the Cleaner Air Oregon rules more stringent and expeditious. Our very lives depend on it.",
cameron,brown,cameronjbrown777@outlook.com,Oregonian,Oregon,"This proposal is too much too fast. It is an opportunistic attempt to push through a personal agenda during a time of perceived crises.  The glass companies that need to be regulated, should be for the chemicals that are a concern.  But not every chemical that a regulator want to put on a list should be regulated all at once, or even have the ability to put as many on some list as they want to.  This is government  overreach. it puts too much power in the hands of regulators and is a recipe for severe consequences.       You can say you won't drive industry out of Oregon, but you will drive industry out.  And you won't know about it until they are gone, at which point there is not getting them back.  This is the type of thing that destroys industries, devastates

Jeff,Thomson,jthompson@amerities.com,"AmeriTies West, LLC",Oregon,"My name is Jeff Thompson, Plant Manager at AmeriTies a local industry.  I have lived in The Dalles and been involve in local industry for 24 years.   During this time, I have participated in our communityâ€™s efforts to recruit new business and industry to our town by serving as a citizen representative on local government committees, participation in local government, and supporting efforts of our local chamber of commerce.  As part of these activities, I have followed the Governorâ€™s Cleaner Air Oregon initiative and the development of the proposed new air regulations.
I believe that the proposed rules discussed here are not in the best interest of the stateâ€™s business communities and will not assist in improving air quality in Oregon. The new regulations put thousands of our stateâ€™s businesses at risk, unnecessary sacrificing jobs in manufacturing, forest products, and agriculture.  All of these sectors are already highly regulated by state and federal governments.  Companies like mine work closely with DEQ to prevent air pollution and to protect public health.  
In proposed new air toxic rules unrealistically target local businesses and manufacturing while leaving other sources of emissions like transportation, open burning, and insecticide use unaccounted and unregulated in regards to toxicity.  
The proposed regulations go far beyond what any other state has imposed, which will put Oregonâ€™s industry, especially our rural industry, at a competitive disadvantage when participating in world, national, and regional market places.  
The proposed fee schedule is onerous to small businesses and will contribute to their competitive disadvantage.  Itâ€™s quite possibly the high fees will force some to relocate out of state or to simply close. Our community cannot afford to put living wage jobs and access to health insurance at risk for regulations that are not based on science or fact.  
As the regulations are currently written, health risk will be accessed using most protective hypothetical computer modeling which assumes someone never leaves their front porch even to go inside for 70 years.  There is no prevision for the use from the outset of actual air monitoring data or for the consideration of how people actually live.   To disallow the use of factual data is not fair to anyone.  
Also the proposed regulations make no allowance for the haphazard implementation of Oregonâ€™s land use system.  A long term-industry should not be penalized because local land use regulations allow new residential construction to encroach on its property line.
Our community has always struggled to provide living wage jobs.  The new regulations will put those jobs at risk.  If these new toxic air regulations take effect as written they will be burdensome on our local industries by imposing unattainable health risk levels base on hypothetical modeling, not fact.  I urge DEQ and the EQC to rewrite these rules to eliminate the unfairness imposed on our stateâ€™s industry.

Mary,Vogel,mary@plangreen.net,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rules for Cleaner Air Oregon!

I live in an apartment building with about 100 other seniors within a block of the intersection of I-405 and Hwy 26.  This is one of the worst pollution hotspots in the state due, in part to your failure to catch up with CA and WA in requiring cleaner diesel technology on trucks.  My downtown neighborhood has also seen a tremendous amount of high-rise construction, so many of these dirty diesel trucks travel on our downtown streets as well as nearby freeways.  Of course, construction has its own pollutantsâ€”especially when it involves teardowns.  In addition, we have many treeless asphalt desserts AKA surface parking lots. Here are my comments on the proposed rules for Cleaner Air Oregon:
1.Existing facilities should have the same health standards as proposed new facilities.  The public is affected by toxic emissions regardless of a facilityâ€™s age!
2.The hard cap of 500 cancer deaths per million per facility does not support or encourage innovation or improvement, potentially allowing an offending industry to avoid any mitigation or curtailment whatsoever.
3.The area cap program originally included consideration of community sources, such as diesel and construction-related emissions, as well as multiple industrial sources impacting one community. These community sources pose a significant public health risk in my neighborhood and many others, and if the area cap program is to protect those most vulnerable to air pollution, these sources MUST be taken into consideration. 
4.The regs should apply to all companies upon adoption, require immediate action, and not be artificially restricted by agency funding and resources.  
5.To work, development of the regs requires meaningful public participation:  e.g, prioritization of the areas most impacted by air pollution, dissemination of all information in accessible language, and advance notification for community members. Language translation is critical for spoken and printed material.  My building houses people speaking at least 8 different languages.  With the help of Google Translate, I have been able to communicate with all of them.  You can too!

Thanks for taking my comments into consideration and I look forward to seeing the improved rules.

Marih,Alyn-Claire,malynclaire@yahoo.com,,OR,"I am a senior living on 10325 SE Holgate Blvd, a heavy traffic street with  apartments overlooking a large parking lot.  The  number  of cars, buses, large trucks, EMS vehicles and steady traffic provides on-going high levels of  environmental pollution.  Living here 2 years, I am experiencing health issues related to lowered immune function, disrupted sleep (especially in spring summer) due to  traffic noise going night and day.  I've experienced  new and significant  respiratory problems since  moving here, even after adding several air purifiers  to my 1 bedroom apartment.   
In addition, the streets lack sidewalks in most areas and are unsafe to walk on especially Holgate Blvd.  

 Placing seniors ( who are likely already facing substantial health issues) in apartment buildings that are located on high traffic -high pollution streets, for the purpose of  providing low-cost housing- runs contrary to our health and safety needs.  Builders, city planners and leaders need to re-think this model for housing low-income  seniors, the disabled and others.  This negative  trend of housing our most vulnerable populations in environments with high concentrations of carcinogens posing direct health risks---needs to stop.

Sonja,Carey,sonja.carey@gmail.com,public citizen,OR," I recently attended the Cleaner Air Oregon public hearing in The Dalles on December 14, 2017 and would like to thank DEQ and OHA for adding The Dalles to its list of cities receiving a public hearing.
I am writing to express my deep hope and citizen's request that AmeriTies be counted into the top 80 ""higher risk businesses"" to be regulated by Cleaner Air Oregon, as presented on the ""Overview of proposed rules for public comment"" sheet, presented at the public hearing. I learned at the hearing that these top 80 companies will be the testing group of the program and that this period of instituting regulatory policy and practice could take 5 years or longer. As a mother, it's hard to write a small, public comment expressing hope that AmeriTies be placed on a list of companies that will be regulated for producing less air toxins within the next 5 years or longer, while I watch other mothers speak about their sick children or grandchildren who have health issues connected with or caused by this dangerous air quality. Yet, I feel there is hope in a department and regulatory system such as Cleaner Air Oregon. It is a start at least, where doing nothing and continuing to ignore the health risks and realities of toxic air in The Dalles is a potentially deadly route for children and local citizens. 
I know that as mothers, we can have a choice in what our children eat and even in where they swim, but not in the air they breathe, beyond removing them from our home communities. I have spoken with women for whom it is not a financially viable option to relocate their family.  My concerns and comments about the Cleaner Air Oregon plan itself are that the facilities are held responsible to calculate the potential health risks of their operations. This creates potential for companies to downplay or even worse, offer false information (perhaps in the form of omission) regarding the health risks they unleash into their neighborhoods and communities. The Cleaner Air Oregon plan, as presented at the public hearing, didn't have specific guidelines as to how businesses would assess their complicity towards health risks. I would like to see a set of guidelines and rules for assessing these risks. 
My other concern is that Cleaner Air Oregon is not prescribing approaches or technologies to control emissions once facilities are instructed to reduce their emissions. It appears it will be up to the companies themselves to come up with ways to do this. Again, perhaps guidelines would be a good starting point. I also don't understand what the time period for reducing emissions would be nor the penalty for not complying with emissions reduction by a deadline. While the Cleaner Air Oregon plan seeks to work with businesses to give them compliance flexibility, I'm not sure that facilities will comply without strict deadlines and penalties. 
My final concern is the option for facilities to claim ""financial hardship"" and have a deadline for compliance extended. While I see how this could be used wisely, I am worried that a large company, such as AmeriTies, may find a way to claim ""financial hardship"" if they are faced with large, additional costs in order to comply with reducing air toxins and perhaps, at the same time, losing production revenue within this process. Basically, it would be unfair for a company polluting at such a high level (with subsequent high health risk to the community) to claim financial hardship because the cost of instituting much needed change within the functioning processes of their facility could hurt or affect the company. Clean air and citizen's health and safety should come before the revenue and 'health' of a corporation.

It seems that our decision makers are held hostage by industry on their claim that they are creating ""jobs"".  This does not discharge their responsibility to their communities.  Many other questions come into play:  Are they sustainable well paying jobs with health and welfare benefits?  How are these jobs affecting the infrastructure and environment of the community?  Is the industry contributing positively to the community or do they have a negative impact?  Has the industry posted a cleanup bond if there is potential for environmental hazards?  If they are given a tax incentive what are the terms of maintaining this incentive?  Is it mutually beneficial to the community and to the industry?  These are some of the far reaching impacts that the DEQ should be considering.

I am now an Oregonian who is deeply and personally effected by the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of myself and my community. Sixteen years ago in 2001, I married an American and moved to Portland from New Zealand. I have struggled consistently with my respiratory health since then. I am a professional singer of 25 years and my day job of 16 years is as a preschool teacher in inner SE Portland. I observe many of my young students dealing with sinus infections year round and it is an ongoing stressful challenge to ensure that my vocal and respiratory organs are well enough to be able to perform at public events. 

Over the years I have spent a lot of time and money with many health professionals, trying different treatment plans to restore my health, no avail. We have come to a very clear conclusion i.e. the doctors and my husband that the air quality in Portland is the number one cause as to why I cannot stay well i.e. environmental toxins. I often ponder if my only option is to move back to New Zealand. I hear a common thread in conversations from friends in my social network saying they moved to Portland and now struggle with ongoing chronic respiratory conditions. 

Having witnessed the whole disgraceful scenario regarding the business 'Bulls Eye Glass' in inner SE Portland, (several children in our school live in that immediate neighborhood) I was deeply alarmed to learn how biased Oregonâ€™s regulations are towards protecting the interests of industry and for the health of Portlander's this has to change.

To ensure continued economic stability in our community, itâ€™s vital for business to operate in a fair and consistent regulatory environment. Cleaner Air Oregon would do just the opposite by driving employers out of state to seek fairer and less burdensome regulatory conditions elsewhere.

Oregon employers, including Georgia-Pacific, already have improved our environment and protected public and employee health by reducing air contaminants.

The regulatory and financial burden imposed by Cleaner Air Oregon on our mill may prevent us from making the capital investments needed to maintain our competitiveness.

These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards should be revised to be more reasonable and more commensurate with the actual risk.

Franz,Cosenza,Franz.Cosenza@gapac.com,,Oregon,"As an Oregon resident and an employee of the renewable-resource-based paper industry, I commend the efforts by the State of Oregon to monitor and protect air quality in the state.   As part of these efforts, and, in particular with the recent proposal of Cleaner Air Oregon rules, I encourage the Oregon DEQ to rely on sound scientific knowledge to develop any new regulation.   Specifically, the literature posted on the Oregon DEQâ€™s website suggests that the proposed Cleaner Air Oregon rules are based on the preconceived conclusion that the comprehensive Clear Air Act federal law, and its National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), have gaps to protect air quality.    However, there is no data-based evidence offered in this website to substantiate this claim.   Furthermore, the comparison table of current Oregon regulations with other states is flawed and biased.   There is only one generic comment for Oregon throughout most of the table, suggesting the lack of or inadequate comparable program element relative to other states.   For example, for the Evaluation element, this table seems to suggest that Oregon lacks emissions reporting requirements while other states have either Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and/or Emissions Inventory.   This is just not true, Oregon has both, TRI under the EPAâ€™s Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) as well as the emissions inventory under Title V of the federal Clean Air Act.  In addition, I hope the Cleaner Air Oregon rulemaking process adheres to a fact-based approach and that it includes a full cost/benefit analysis.   Please consider the full impact this set of proposed rules would have on Oregonâ€™s environment, society, and economy, and make your decision based on what is in the best interest for Oregon and its residents.   Thank you.",
Katie,Bretsch,kbretsch@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

The name of the agency itself telegraphs the intent to trade off public and environmental health in order to protect private profit. You are giving away our health as a subsidy to select private enterprises who aren't willing to come into the modern age. This is simply unacceptable. 

The acceptable subsidy to any business from the public health is ZERO. Any program that doesn't start with that measure of performance is a violation of human rights which should be intolerable to any ethical official. Yes, your proposed program is unethical and morally corrupt. 

I am more sensitive than most to air pollution, so I am paying more than most of this invisible tax your agency is imposing to protect these private profiteers from the requirement to modernize.  

____________________
I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.
 
Lastly, it is the responsibility of the agency to meaningfully engage community members and that includes providing accessible information, translation, and childcare services at community engagement opportunities and events.

We have a proven record of complying with federal, state and local rules and regulations to protect public and environmental health, including multiple federal rules that already regulate the same sorts of air pollutants that Oregonâ€™s program would.   I work at the facility and see first-hand how seriously USW Local 1097 employees and the company take protecting the environment.

The regulatory and financial burden imposed by Cleaner Air Oregon, which would be the strictest in the country, may prevent our facility from making the capital investments needed to maintain our competitiveness. Already, our facility is at a competitive disadvantage to other paper mills in the Midwest and Southern states that have lower energy, wood supply and transportation costs.  

Oregon employers, including Georgia-Pacific, already have improved our environment and protected public and employee health by reducing air contaminants. Due to substantial investments in pollution control technology, Oregon industrial sources now account for less than 15 percent of air pollutants.

These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards must be revised.  This program is in response to a Portland-area issue and based on unrealistic, hypothetical health outcomes that does not take into account the health impact of job losses on rural Oregon.  Poorly conceived rules and requirements can have devastating consequences on rural Oregon businesses. Please consider the impact on our nearly 750 jobs and our $72 million annual payroll that contribute to rural Oregonâ€™s economy and our rural community before finalizing Cleaner Air Oregonâ€™s unnecessary, unjustifiable, and burdensome standards.

Mysti ,Frost ,mfrost@beyondtoxics.org,Beyond Toxics ,Oregon ,"I support the Cleaner Air Oregon proposed  rules in full and urge our State Legislature to fully fund the implementation of the program.
I was at the public hearing in Eugene, OR and witnessed the timber industry use job cutbacks as the main reason why they oppose cleaner air regulations. I witnessed timber industry employees read testimony, likely written by their employers, stating they were worried about their jobs being taken away if their employers were forced to comply with these new standards.  Beyond Toxics was the only one present at the hearing that testified in support of the rules. I was the last one to speak in a room packed with timber industry. As I left the room two men blocked my ability to exit.  I must admit I felt threatened and I fled the hearing and ran to my car.
This big industry tactic, holding jobs ransom, is nothing new. Since the industrial revolution, big industry has fought tooth the nail against any kind of regulation or transparency no matter what the cost to public health. They continue to ignore the research on the economic benefits of reducing pollution for the health of their own workers and the surrounding communities, and only care about financial gains.  

It is my hope that the DEQ and people of Oregon see through these scare tactics. With my past experience as a paralegal, I worked on many cases regarding accidents on the job involving the timber industry and their industrial facilities. Horror story after horror story has left me feeling that the timber industry, like many other big polluters, do not care about the health and wellbeing of their employees or the families that live around their facilities.

They claim to be â€œsmall family businessesâ€&#65533;. This is another false statement. For example, the woman representing Roseburg Forest Products claimed they are a small family business. However Roseburg Forest Products employs over three thousand employees and has a revenue of 1 billion dollars and is the 5th largest private employer in Oregon. They have the resources to invest in the pollution reduction requirements of Cleaner Air Oregon.

Let us not lose sight of the goal. It is time to move away from an extraction economy. It is time to make big industry pay for the pollution they dump into our communities. It is time to reward businesses that keep toxics out of our air and use renewable green energy. It is time to push for a just transition from old carbon jobs to green jobs. ",

Mike,Smith,itsfishy2000@yahoo.com,GP Paper,Oregon,"The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is seeking public comment on a program called â€œCleaner Air Oregon.â€&#65533;  I am writing this letter to Local 1097 members to request that you take action by commenting on this program by the December 22, 2017 at 4:00 p.m. deadline.  

  

As many of you are aware of already, in the Pacific Northwest, this region generally has higher energy costs, wood costs, and transportation costs compared to other mills in the midwest and southern regions in which the Wauna Mill directly competes with.  The few competitive advantages that the Wauna Mill does have consists of the skilled workforce that United Steelworkers Local 1097 provides and the ability to make our own pulp at the mill versus buying purchased pulp.

  

Now â€œCleaner Air Oregonâ€&#65533; has the potential to add even more regulations to our pulp mill and east side operations.  This program, which is DEQâ€™s statewide response to a localized Portland-area problem associated with a colored glass manufacturer, would create the most restrictive air toxics program in the country by imposing standards many times more stringent than similar programs in other states (including California), yet would do little to improve human health.   This would make it harder for the Wauna Mill to compete with paper mills in other states.  And the money that GP would have to invest in this program, would take away from money they could invest in the Wauna Mill.  

  
 
The pulp and paper industry has already been following the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rules established in 2001 with on-going updates as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).    In addition, Oregon employers including Georgia-Pacific, already have a successful record of reducing air contaminants, improving our environment, and protecting public and employee health.  Due to substantial investments in pollution control technology, Oregon industrial sources now account for less than 15 percent of air pollutants.   DEQâ€™s program is also based on unrealistic hypothetical health outcomes.  It should be based on likely health outcomes and balanced with the health impacts from widespread job loss and the impact on rural Oregon, which would result from the implementation of this unreasonable and unnecessary scheme.  

  

In addition, I work with the Pulp & Paper Resource Council (PPRC) a grass roots organization consisting of union pulp & paper workers who work to educate the federal government on federal legislation that impacts the competitiveness of the paper mills that our unionâ€™s work at.  I have witnessed first-hand how excessive government regulations can impact mills.

After attending the public meeting in Eugene, it seems that this action has been put into play before enough research has been done to realize the full impact of such actions. One such impact is the restrictions on one of this states long lasting industries, Forest Products. The new standard being proposed would eliminate, or make such manufacturing so costly that these jobs will end up being exported to other States, or worse yet other Countries. This will be in direct contradiction to desires of Governor Kate Brown in which she has praised the advancement of Mass Timber Products and how ""It makes more sense for this product to be produced in this state over any other state"" (Oregon Best Fest 2015). This statement is great, ability to revitalize rural Oregon, increase use of our over-stocked forest instead of sitting back and watching (and smelling) it burn, reduce use of concrete and steel in building products (huge energy hogs).

Williams recommends adding a statement in section OAR 340-245-0040 stating that air toxics emitted solely from the combustion of natural gas or propane are excluded from Equation 2.  Since air toxics from natural gas and propane combustion are excluded from a sourceâ€™s Total Risk Determination, these emissions should also be excluded from ODEQâ€™s score ranking calculations for each source during the Tier 1 and Tier 2 process.
Williams also recommends clarifying in section OAR 340-245-0040 that air toxics emitted solely from natural gas and propane combustion are excluded from the evaluation process of designating potential Multi-Source Risk Areas.

I am the great, great, great granddaughter of Oregon pioneers. I am terribly concerned about the growing problem of air pollution in our state. My father suffers from severe asthma  and air pollution can have serious, potentially deadly, consequences .

I join other Oregonians in observing that Oregon regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. 

As the ecologist, novelist Wendell Berry notes: ""We have lived our lives by the assumption that what is good for us will be good for the world. We have been wrong. We must change our lives so to make it possible to live by the contrary assumption, that what is good for the world will be good for us...""  The time for positive change is NOW.

Oregon can be the national leader in efforts to protect and improve air quality throughout the state. We have seen the dire consequences of air pollution in India, China, and communities around the U.S. The fires on the West Coast this year have given us a sample of our future if we do not do more to protect the air in Oregon! For example, we can do more to protect our urban and rural trees and greenery that catch so many pollution particulates!

I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

Rosanna,Henderson,rosannabn@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I live in the northern portion of Westmoreland, near the bend of McLoughlin boulevard and the Brooklyn Rail Yard. We're a household of healthy, fit bicycle commuters, but since moving to this neighborhood three years ago, three of the five members of my household have developed asthma. I'm deeply worried about the effect of PM 2.5 diesel particulate from the trains and trucks servicing the rail yard on my small children's developing lungs, and for my aging mother. 

Caps on urban polluters need to take into account the background pollution neighbors are exposed to--and this background pollution includes traffic from major highways, trucking at Brooklyn Yard, and the increasing forest fires that we can expect from climate change. 

Thank you for prioritizing my health over commercial interests.

Last year, for the first time ever in my life, I developed asthma. Since then it has grown progressively worse, limiting my physical activity and at times impacting my ability to work. As a small business owner, this has been particularly difficult to bear.

There are a lot of factors in the development of asthma, but one of them is surely the air I am breathing. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but the asthma came just a couple years after we moved to a new home that is very close to several significant sources of emissions including the Brooklyn railyard and 99e. What's not a coincidence is that the homes closest to these pollutions sources are some of the last remaining affordable options in the entire area. It doesn't make sense to me that you would exclude these sources from an area cap simply because they are traffic. Anything that we breathe matters.

The outside of my windows and porch are covered in a slimy black layer of soot. It terrifies me to think we breathe this. We've invested in air filters inside, but even so my five year-old son is developing asthma. My son loves hearing and watching the trains in the yard. It breaks my heart to think that they are poisoning him. I'm concerned my baby daughter is next.  Existing sources of pollution near my home would be held to lesser standards than new ones. Is my family's health less important than a family living near a newly proposed facility ? Shouldn't there be an equal focus on people who are being harmed today?

I've met so many Portlanders who are impacted by our air quality. Particularly this year, with our rash of forest fires, people are getting sick and are growing ever more concerned about the significant baseline pollution we all breathe. Please do not waste this opportunity to help us.

Climate change is a huge threat to all of us and the longer we wait the more difficult it will be to take meaningful action.

While I am satisfied with the rules, I believe that they do not go far enough. As a resident of Corvallis, I live near the Hollingsworth and Vose manufacturing plants. Under the new rules these plants can average their emissions, leading to the appearance of a functional filtration system. However, one plant is releasing matter sig. smaller than the other, with small PM being particularly dangerous to health. 

Please revise the rules that allow power plants to average their emissions and thus forego necessary safety standards to protect human and environmental health.",

Re: Cleaner Air Oregon Draft Rules

All Oregon communities want clean air and need strong protection from industrial air toxics. In general, we support the adoption of the Cleaner Air Oregon draft rules with the following exceptions:

Lower Public Health Risks
We want the DEQ to deny air pollution permits when emissions would cause or contribute to an exceedence of the Area Multi-Source Risk Action Levels of 50 cancers in 1 million or Hazard Index of 2.  The DEQ must eliminate their newer and higher proposed risk levels.  500 in 1 million deaths from cancer and Hazard Index of 3 is not health protective and is much too high for allowable cancer and disease risk. Do not allow any Risk Action Levels above an HI of 2 (340-245-0030).  The 500/million cancer death number and Hazard Index of 30 are not acceptable in a health-based regulation. Include a cap for multiple facilities in an area.

Conditional Risk Level Requirements
We disagree with these allowances for a source that is unable to comply. A 5-year period to comply if facility is in the first tier is far too long a period. During that time, the DEQ is proposing a facility can update. This is not acceptable. We can refuse polluting industries. 

All industries must comply with the requirements, both existing and new facilities. We disagree with the Directorâ€™s Decision as the sole decider of whether a company can continue polluting at or above 100 deaths per million. Use 50 cancers in 1 million, the same numbers as new companies. 

Environmental Justice 
To comply with Environmental Justice requirements, change the word, â€œConsiderâ€&#65533; to Evaluate air toxics emissions and their impacts, and if the DEQ finds detrimental effects on sensitive populations, take immediate and positive steps to reverse impacts and remedy the situation.

Small business exceptions
The size of a business is not a determinant of the size of that businesses air toxics pollution. Any exceptions and allowances afforded to small businesses must be based on the level of their pollution, not the number of their employees. For example, the art glass factories in Portland, responsible for such harmful pollution, had fewer than the â€œfifty employeesâ€&#65533; the DEQ proposes to use.

Climate Benefits
The emission of CO2 has a strong relationship to the emissions of hazardous air pollutants.  The DEQ can help Oregon move forward on addressing and reducing the impacts of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere by ensuring that the Cleaner Air Oregon rules are robust and set high standards for compliance so that polluters arenâ€™t falling through the cracks or are given an â€œoff-rampâ€&#65533; to complying with new health-based rules.

Subject: CAO Draft Rules Comment

I was involved in a DEQ Advisory Committee in the 1970s for Oregonâ€™s Clean Air Plan. I have been aware for years of the need for Oregon to regulate air toxicsâ€”not just the six criteria pollutants. Therefore I support the new health-based regulatory protections if they can be strengthened. 

What is good about the proposed rules:
â€¢	They are based on human healthâ€”not technology or â€œbest practices.â€&#65533;
â€¢	They require reporting of air toxics from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit these chemicals. 
â€¢	They set health-based risk action levels and permitting procedures for 215 air toxics.
â€¢	They consider the cumulative health risks from multiple sources within a geographic area.

What needs strengthening:
â€¢	The hard cap of 500 cancer deaths per million people per facility is too high. What this does is give permission for higher-emitting facilities to reach that threshold of 500, which in certain cases could make the air quality in a given area even worse. It would also make it difficult to hold an emitting facility accountable for the public health risk it poses if it is emitting within the permitted risk threshold. The cap should be lowered to 50 in one million.
â€¢	The Directors' Consultation, giving the DEQ director final authority in deciding whether the facility can continue to pollute beyond its permitted limit, turns the science-based regulatory process into a political process. It should be eliminated.
â€¢	Any restrictions to implementation should not be artificially restricted in the rules by agency funding and resources. The rules should apply to all companies upon adoption.
â€¢	Include a citizen enforcement clause in the event that DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules.
â€¢	Make the Emissions Inventory available to the public in a user-friendly data base.

I do want industries to be able to remain in Oregon, but Iâ€™m not convinced by the complaints of polluting industries that stricter rules will cause a loss of jobs. Other states are already doing much more than Oregon! And the World Health Organization stated in their 2014 report that ""investing in health in general has been shown to give economic returns to the health sector, other sectors and the wider economy, with an estimated fourfold return on every dollar invested.""

I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Ellen,Wax,,Working Waterfront Coalition,OR,"Dear Mr. Westersund,
The Working Waterfront Coalition (WWC) Joins other impacted organizations and individuals who oppose the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Oregon Health Authority's proposed Cleaner Air Oregon (CAO) rules.

The WWC is committed to achieving triple bottom line outcomes for waterfront industry and businesses based primarily in Portland but also throughout Oregon and in the local communities where our members operate. We advocated for sound, balanced policies and ground-rules that support economic development and jobs, environmental protection and improvements, and social equity and enhancement. The WWC is comprised mainly of companies engaged in manufacturing, metals recycling, energy suppply, transport services, waterfront tourism, hospitality and education, and various traded-sector activities. Many of the well-paying jobs at member companies' operations do not require a college education.
On behalf of our member companies and their employees, many of whom will be negatively impacted by the CAO rules, I urge you to revise the proposed rules. Despite the push made by the loudest voices in the state for more strident reporting requirements and tighter restrictions on industrial operations than those that exist today, the proposed rules appear to be a political over-reaction to one specific situation in Portland that has been rectified.
Our member businesses already work hard to prevent air pollution and protect public health. Adequate rules covering point-source issuance of targeted chemicals and substances have existed for many years in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 40). Oregon has benefitted, environmentally, in many ways from these already stringent regulations, resulting in very good air quality that has improved drastically over the past ten years. Oregon's attempt to ""one-up"" federal regulations and exceed regulations instituted by other states with far higher populations, population densities, and environmental problems will only create further burdens on industry and jobs here.
Because these rules restrict companies based on the emissions of their neighbors, proximity to major roadways and other local sources of air pollutants, these rules as drafted create a disincentive for companies to locate in areas that are appropriately zoned for industrial activity. They will likely drive heavy industry and trade out of the state. This will negatively impact economic stability and employment, with little improvement on air quality in impacted regions. WWC members work extremely hard to maintain their operations and workforces, in a fully compliant manner. The proposed rules are a misguided attempt to further diminsh the viability of many valued local companies and workers. We respectfully request that these proposed rules be terminated or revised.
In summary, the proposed new CAO regulations:
*Put thousands of our local businesses at risk, potentially and unnecessarily sacrificing middle-income jobs in sectors like manufacturing, forest products, agriculture, and energy.
*Duplicate the hard work already being done by businesses to prevent air pollution and protect public health.
*Are not based on science.
*Unrealistically target local employers rather than all sources of emissions.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  I am confident that with a revised set of rules, Oregonians can achieve both clean air and a healthy economy with fair and reasonable air quality regulations.

Sincerely, 
Ellen Wax
Executive Director

We are ALL responsible for protecting our people.  A good place to start is with monitoring and responding to the major  threats facing us, and requiring industrial polluters to clean up their acts! ",
Scott,Dunn,,Timber Products Company,OR,"Mr. Westersund:
We are writing to submit public comments on the Cleaner Air Oregon proposed rule. After reviewing the draft rule language, we have several issues with the proposed rule.
the firs issue is the overall scope of the rule. The rule is geared only towards industry and industry is a very small portion of the issue. in fact, industry accounts for less than 15% of air pollutants. The main contributors of air pollutants are mobile sources and wood fired heating. It is unfair to place such a burden on a small contributor to the issue.
Second, the Risk Action Levels (RALs) are far too conservative. The proposed risk levels are more stringent than those in effect in South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). There is no way that the entire state of Oregon has a bigger issue with air pollution than the SCAQMD, so why are we being held to an even higher standard? These RALs are only going to force business to close their doors and relocate to other states.  DEQ staff has argued that these levels are consistent with what the state of Washington uses. This statement however is inaccurate. The state of Washington's risk levels are not applied to existing sources that are not undergoing modification. If there is a modification the risk levels are only applied tot the emissions from the new unit, not the entire plant site.
Third, the program should be looking at actual emissions and not the Potential to Emit (PTE). Basing the risk proposed by a facility of of PTE will greatly overstate the risk proposed by a facility. PTE numbers are not a realistic representation of what a facility emits.
Fourth, the rules guidance for receptors is not accurate. The rule is requiring modeling for where someone might be for a few minutes instead of using realistic information of where people actually are and how long they are actually there. This too results in a greatly overstated risk for a facility.
Finally the Community program should be addressed in a totally different rule making since it is not well thought out. You risk a conflict with every county's land use planning and zoning process. you are essentially punishing businesses for being located in industrial zones by restricting what they are able to do because of their neighbor's emissions. This section of the rule should be completely removed and addressed separately.

Thank you for the opportunity to address our concerns with the draft rule.

Scott Dunn

 December 4, 2017
 To the DEQ:
 I am a retired physician who lives in the inner southeast ""ring neighborhoods"" of Portland.  I am sensitive to the health effects of toxic air pollution, particularly wood smoke, diesel exhaust, and heavy metal contamination.  Personally I suffer from frequent headaches, sinus pain, and respiratory difficulties due to dirty air.
 I urge the DEQ to establish strong health based regulations to protect from toxic air pollution.  I approve the proposed rules, especially the application of an ""area cap"" based on the cumulative health risks from multiple sources in a geographic area.  I am disappointed to see that mobile sources of air pollution such as diesel particulate are not included in risk assessments.  This is a glaring omission because the fine carbon particulates of diesel exhaust adhere heavy metals and other toxins, and enhance their delivery directly into the bloodstream via the lungs.  If the DEQ is serious about protecting public health from toxic air pollution, diesel particulates must be factored into the cumulative health effects of toxins.
 In a time of escalating health costs strong regulation of air borne toxics is even more important.  The EPA and the World Health Organization have shown that every dollar spent on pollution prevention and control renders a thirty-dollar savings for the economy.  The benefits of cleaner air extend beyond public health and include business innovation, attraction of new businesses and investment, and decreased pollution mitigation costs.  These monetary benefits far outweigh the costs of cleaner air.  Nevertheless some smaller companies will be financially challenged by compliance, and help should be offered with loans and grants.
 Rules have no value unless they are enforced.  I urge inclusion of a citizen enforcement clause should the DEQ be prevented from enforcing the rules.  The Emissions Inventory should be easily available to the public on-line; this is also a necessary enforcement tool.
 Overall the proposed rules appear to minimally achieve health-based regulatory protections.  They must be stronger, and weakening by the lobbying of industrial polluters must be resisted.

I wholeheartedly support adopting Cleaner Air Oregon's health-based regulations to protect people and the environment from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules.

Marny,Spoons,marnyspoons@gmail.com,Eastside Portland Air Coalition,OR,"This is my oral testimony from Saturday's Cleaner Air Oregon public forum in Portland. It was strange reading to a nearly empty room, but Senator Lew Frederick and DEQ Director Richard Whitman were there, along with Katharine De Luna Plateada, Greg Thelen and Cindy Young to kindly cheer me on. I did approach Jill Inahara and let her know I didn't mean to throw her under the bus personally, but I needed to go on the record about what I feel needs to be said about the kind of leadership that we deserve, as opposed to what is ""realistic."" 
""First, I want to say that there is so much to appreciate about these rules, and I'm very grateful for Cleaner Air Oregon.
I want to talk about balance.
Throughout this process, I've been hearing the word ""balance"" used a lot. Jill Inahara used it again Wednesday evening to explain why allowable levels of toxics in the proposed rules reach so far above the health expert-recommended protective level of 1...to 10, 25, 50, up to 500 (which is just reckless) additional cases of cancer per million.
'We must balance health with the economy,' she said. 'People get sick when they're out of work.'
When I hear that word, balance, said in this context, this is what I hear the DEQ saying:
--We are beholden to big business, but we're not supposed to say that.
--More paid industry lobbyists show up at legislative days than community members, so we have to do what they say, or we won't get funded.
--We must remain soft on big business while maintaining the optics of being heroes and protectors of the environment and community.
DEQ, you've had your mission statement read to you before in public comments, but I'm going to do it again.
'DEQ's mission is to be a leader in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon's air, land and water.'
It's not your job to pander to polluting businesses. They have tax credits, loopholes and Oregon Business Industry. Your job is to BE the balance against businesses getting too much leeway to pollute vulnerable communities, our beautiful state and our one vulnerable planet. Your job is to be a leader in the fierce protection of our air, removing the arbitrary clauses from those risk action levels. Your job is to ensure that these levels start protective and stay protective. 
Our dependence on an extractive, status quo economy is a bit of an addiction that puts the illusion of wealth before true abundance. When these businesses cry out about how much their jobs matter, your job, as a leader, is to bring the narrative firmly back to what matters even more: our air, our land, and our water.
That is what I call balance.""

Lisa,Lombardo,lisablombardo@yahoo.com,,OR,"RE: CAO Draft Rules Comment

My name is Lisa Lombardo, I have lived in Eugene, OR for six years, and I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Environmental Studies from the University of Oregon. I am strongly in favor of health-based regulation of industrial air pollution in Oregon, and I am very glad that the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is drafting Cleaner Air Oregon, and that the DEQ consulted with the Oregon Environmental Justice Task Force while doing so. 
I appreciate that the Cleaner Air Oregon draft extends air pollution regulation from just the largest polluters to many more businesses, and from 6 toxins to 660, and that all commercial and industrial facilities will be required to report on the 660 air toxins. I also like that the new regulations would apply to all existing, modified and new facilities. However, I do not think the current draft extends regulation far enough: even businesses that have 50 or fewer employees should be required to comply with the new regulations, as the number of employees does not necessarily correlate with the amount of pollution emitted, and companies are allowed to opt-out of regulation based on the number of employees, they may be incentivized to lay off or not hire more employees. In order to help small businesses comply with the new regulations, loans should be made available to them. 
I also like that the current draft takes cumulative health risks from multiple sources in one area into account, and that it sets health-based limits for 24-hour and annual exposure to carcinogens. However, a 24-hour limit is not always safe enough, so I think that the regulation should also specify health-based limits for 1-hour exposure.
In order for Cleaner Air Oregon to be effective at protecting the health of Oregonians, I do not think that Alternate Noncancer Risk Action Levels (ANRALS) should be allowed to be proposed. In general, the regulation should specify that whenever there is uncertainty about the health effects of a chemical, the precautionary principle should be appliedâ€”that is that until sufficient data is available, the regulations should err on the side of caution to protect human health. The new regulation should also use a Cancer Index of 50 in one million or lower, and a Hazard Index of 1 at all risk levels. 
Finally, I am concerned that the Directors Consultation will become political, rather than being based upon scientific evidence. I would also like to see a Citizen Enforcement Clause, so that the regulations are not dependent on the DEQ alone for enforcement.
With these improvements, I believe Cleaner Air Oregon has the potential to improve the air quality and the health of our state. Thank you for your ongoing efforts in crafting this important regulation.

Jim,Conroy,conroyarchila@hotmail.com,,OR,"My experience going to public meetings of DEQ has convinced me that the agency has no political will to actually protect our air and water, to say nothing about the rest of our environment.
There are insufficient safeguards about the carbon emissions and also the dangerous chemicals released on a daily and nightly basis by Intel and the other chip makers in the Hillsboro area.  No assistance is provided to citizens regarding problems they experience with the Hillsboro airport.
DEQ and EQC do not place the health of the citizens of Oregon as their first priority.  They are effectively a captured regulatory body and organization.
Now would be a perfect time to change that.  I doubt that there will be any changes that significantly assist in improved health for people.  Improved financial conditions for some few will, of course, continue to be the priority for politicians and the bureaucrats who are controlled by them.",

Dear Mr. Westersund:

My name is Kris DiPaola and I am a mother living and working in Hillsboro and Beaverton.  I am very concerned about the fact that Oregon does not have health based air quality regulations.  In this era of increased understanding about the hazards of even the tiniest presence of toxins, this is an unacceptable situation.  Please do all you can to implement the strongest protections for our health and the environment.  In particular, the Citizen Suit provision needs to be included in the Cleaner Air Rules. 
 
Please know I represent legions of other parents when I say we are very concerned about the air we breathe.  Our children are sicker and sicker and we are aware this is caused by toxins in our food and environment.  The days of private profit at the risk of public health are over.  You simply must act on behalf of people and not corporate profits.

The Air Quality Advisory Committee that Intel formed because two environmental organizations threatened to sue Intel for breaking the law is still meeting even though they signed a formal Good Neighbor Agreement in Dec. 2015.  Hillsboro Air and Water, Dale Feik, Campaign Manager, made it very clear that that GNA was not adequate because it did not address the toxic air emission limits in the current and to be proposed Title V Operating Permit.  He resigned from being a member of the GNA team because of that.  Thomas Wood, air permit attorney for Intel, is lobbying hard to slow down the Cleaner Air Oregon process.  It should not be slowed down and it MUST NOT be watered down.  

Thank you for your time, and in advance for doing the right thing- Kristina DiPaola Mother, Project Directory Hillsboro, OR",

Hi,

I am concerned that the DEQ rules should include stringent monitoring requirements and regulations for emissions that impact our lives throughout Oregon.  Since I live in Hillsboro and am a retired public health faculty member, I am very concerned about the lack of monitoring and lax permitting of both the Intel plants and the Hillsboro airport.  We breathe the air here every day and we need to make sure that emissions are adequately regulated and scrubbed.  In addition to the adults in the area who are affected, there are thousands of children whom we are counting on to stay healthy and become educated so they can contribute to the world.  Toxic emissions hinder that progress.  We expect the DEQ to protect all of us and not turn its back on the needs of residents.  We are counting on you to be a strong voice for people who live and work here and not give in to pressures.

Thank you,

Melissa,Rehder,misslissr@yahoo.com,,OR,"RE: Oregon deserves health-based regulations to protect people from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution

Joe Westersund,

I wholeheartedly support adopting Cleaner Air Oregon's health-based regulations to protect people and the environment from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules. 

Thank you.

Joe ,Hovey,joho@joehovey.com,,Oregon,"As has been widely reported, Portland, Oregon has been ranked among the worst in the nation for air quality according to a 2011 EPA study released in 2015. Further, Multnomah ranks among the worst counties in the nation for diesel particulates, which have been linked to Alzheimerâ€™s, obesity, heart defects, and cancers.

Your new rules begin to address this situation- thank you.

But you must all get tougher:

1. All facilities, new and existing, must be regulated the same for strict adherence to healthy air standards.

2. Unfiltered industrial trucks are legal here but not in CA. This is absurd, as diesel filters are quite affordable for large trucking operations and SAVE LIVES..

â€œExposure to diesel engine emissions is associated with chronic bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbation, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,1â€“4 and in 2012 diesel emissions were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen in humans.5 Given the health effects of diesel emissions and ubiquitous environmental exposures, reducing engine emissions has become a public health priority.â€&#65533;

3. Eliminate loopholes in your rules, giving wide discretion to â€œDirectorâ€™s Consultationsâ€&#65533; which opens the door to possible corruption, and the â€œAlternate Noncancer Risk Action Level (ANRAL).â€&#65533; Science shows that air pollution causes many more debilitating illnesses than just asthma and cancers.

4. Employ the Hazard Index (non-cancerous health impacts) of 1 at ALL risk levels. It has been well documented that our understanding of the toxicity of air-pollutants has been widely underestimated, and as new scientific findings continue to develop, we must err on side of caution.

5. Donâ€™t allow industry to claim they will suffer for protecting human health. We taxpayers pay millions annually for health concerns created or exacerbated by pollution, and industry is subsidized by our dollars. Meanwhile, Oregon industries continue to pay some of the lowest taxes in the nation.

6. Keep all citizens apprised with information about pollution in their area with more than a website or an email. Folks should receive PAPER NOTICES via mail or as door fliers. Not everyone has internet access.

7. Do deeper research with plant pathologists into the impacts of aerosolised particulates on plants. Urban gardeners need to know if they are growing safe food or not. 

Our health, economy, live-ability, tourist industry, and natural resources upon which we all depend are at serious risk from toxic air pollution. Please take a brave stand to clean up the air we all must breathe. We will support you.

I've lived in Southern Oregon for over thirty five years. Many of you have probably never had the opportunity to live and work in a rural Oregon community or facilities like those owned by Roseburg Forest Products or the economic backbone of the community. The proposed Cleaner Air Oregon regulations would make Oregonâ€™s air toxics program the most stringent in the nation even stricter than the major urban areas like Los Angeles. On the surface this may sound like a good thing, protecting human health. But under the surface the proposed regulations are setting the stage for an incredibly harmful effects on human health and the health of Oregon communities. As they're currently written the proposed regulations will put thousands of our local businesses at risk. Not only in the manufacturing sector but other sectors including forest products, agriculture and energy. With the addition of these onerous regulations and requirements many companies will not be able to afford the additional costs to meet the new requirements and will curtail operations or worse, shut down.
Other companies will choose to leave the state altogether. Either way the communities that depend on these businesses will suffer extending to schools, churches and overall public health as unemployment rates increase. When those jobs go away poverty, drug use and crime rates go up these are the unintended consequences of the proposed regulations as they are currently written in no way is this healthy for any community.

The company cannot stay competitive with foreign exports under such regulations putting our communities at risk. The proposed regulations are unreasonable and would hurt Oregonâ€™s ability to attract new manufacturing jobs as well as put current industrial jobs at risk.
Our communities cannot afford to lose more jobs the consequences would be devastating. Not only affecting industry as a whole but to the overall well-being of every citizen in our great state.

Our employees earn good wages and have good health insurance benefits both very important to good health. Boise Cascade has spent millions of dollars controlling air pollution at our Oregon Mills over the past twenty five years. We have installed emission controls on our boilers to significantly reduce particulate matter and help the area come into compliance with particulate matter air quality standards. We have installed emission controls on our boilers and on our veneer dryers to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants including many of the air toxics that will be regulated under the proposed rules. Boise Cascade will continue to add emission controls to comply with state and federal rules or when such controls are necessary to protect the community from a demonstrated public health problem if such controls are economically justified. But Boise Cascade is very concerned about the proposed rules we are concerned that DEQ has proposed rules which we cannot reasonably determine the impact to our operations. We are concerned that DEQ has not adequately assessed the potential loss of jobs that may result from these rules and therefore has not adequately assessed the economic impacts of the proposed rules but most of all we are concerned that DEQ has rushed to create environmental rules to solve the political problem rather than a public health problem. We ask that D.E.Q. slow down this rule making and first develop rules to assess the problem and potential public impact. Once the public health and economic impacts of the area emissions are quantified then D.Q. will be in a better position to address the problems with more appropriate rules.

Craig,Baker,gunner_1965@hotmail.com,paper mill employee,Washington,"As an employee of the Georgia-Pacific tissue mill in Wauna, Oregon I Think the regulatory and financial burden imposed by Cleaner Air Oregon, which would be the strictest in the country, will prevent our facility from making the capital investments needed to maintain our competitiveness. 
Already, our facility is at a competitive disadvantage to other paper mills in the Midwest and Southern states that have lower energy, wood supply and transportation costs. 
 Oregon employers, including Georgia-Pacific, already have improved our environment and protected public and employee health by reducing air contaminants. Due to substantial investments in pollution control technology.

 These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards must be revised.  This program is in response to a Portland-area issue and based on unrealistic, hypothetical health outcomes that does not take into account the health impact of job losses on rural Oregon.

 Poorly conceived rules and requirements can have devastating consequences on rural Oregon businesses. Please consider the impact on our nearly 750 jobs and our $72 million annual payroll that contribute to rural Oregonâ€™s economy and our rural community before finalizing Cleaner Air Oregonâ€™s unnecessary, unjustifiable, and burdensome standards.

To ensure continued economic stability in our community, itâ€™s vital for business to operate in a fair and consistent regulatory environment. Cleaner Air Oregon would do just the opposite by driving employers out of state to seek fairer and less burdensome regulatory conditions elsewhere.

Oregon employers, including Georgia-Pacific, already have improved our environment and protected public and employee health by reducing air contaminants.

Cleaner Air Oregon also is based on unrealistic hypothetical health outcomes. It should be based on likely health outcomes and balanced with the health impacts from widespread job loss, which could result from the implementation of this unreasonable and unnecessary scheme.  

The regulatory and financial burden imposed by Cleaner Air Oregon on our mill may prevent us from making the capital investments needed to maintain our competitiveness. It also jeopardizes  â€™Georgia-Pacific's ability to continue investing in our rural community as Clatsop Countyâ€™s leading manufacturing employer (nearly 750 jobs and an annual payroll of $72 million).  

These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards should be revised to be more reasonable and more commensurate with the actual risk. Notwithstanding industryâ€™s relatively small contribution to air pollution, DEQ has proposed a costly regulatory program that would do little to improve Oregonâ€™s air at a considerable cost to the state and individual businesses by unnecessarily imposing air toxics thresholds that are many times more stringent than similar programs in other states. The costs to the state and its economy of using such stringent regulatory thresholds far outweigh any identifiable health benefits.

Poorly conceived rules and requirements can have devastating consequences on local businesses. Please consider the impact on our employer, our jobs and our community before finalizing Cleaner Air Oregonâ€™s unnecessary, unjustifiable and burdensome standards. Thank you.

I read through some of the proposed regulations which I am in support of.  One piece that I do not support, however, is that the industries will be estimating how many toxins are in their emissions.  I do not think that a company is impartial or necessarily able to provide an accurate estimation of the toxins in their emissions.  
Who will be checking to make sure they are accurate?  And how often?  
We need more oversight, and one that is provided by impartial folks who work for the state.  
I am in support of these changes but see the flaw in having companies self report.

ALLAN,RUDWICK,arudwick@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.
 
Lastly, it is the responsibility of the agency to meaningfully engage community members and that includes providing accessible information, translation, and childcare services at community engagement opportunities and events.

Diesel trucks are the primary offender in my neighborhood in NE Portland and looking at pollution maps I wonder if anyone can feel healthy living where I do.  A huge number of new housing units is going up in and around downtown Portland and many of the current and future residents will be breathing in diesel-related poisons for years to come unless we do something meaningful about it.  Please stop dragging your feet and make some change.  If nothing happens soon, it seems likely that a regional air quality agency for the PDX Metro will need to be formed.  This feels like extra unneeded bureaucracy but whatever it takes to keep me and my family safe.

Alicia,Cohen,cohenalicia@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

In 2003 I moved to a new home in Portland near NE 33rd and Killingworth. There I began noticing strange, powerful toxic smells at all hours of the day and night. Not one smell but many different kinds—all of them worrying. That was the beginning of a journey that brings me to this day. I am grateful to have the opportunity to comment on the Cleaner Air Oregon rules. 

Over the years my life has been, in many fundamental and important ways, defined by the horrible air quality in Oregon. It took me years to figure out what was really going on. In 2003 there was very little public information accessible to lay people that explained why our air smelled so awful. Over the years I came to understand that our air stinks because we live in one of the dirtiest air-sheds in the entire country. My daughter and son attend a school ranked in the bottom 2% nationally for toxic air from sitting facilities. (Abernethy Elementary). There has been a cancer cluster investigation in my presentl neighborhood because so many mothers with children at Abernethy have cancer. I just attended a funeral two weeks ago for a mother of two young sons who attended Abernethy. The low toxic inventory rankings (botom 2% nationally) for Abernethy have nothing to do with the historic exposures all these neighbors have suffered due to Bullseye glass emissions. It has nothing to do with the fact that Oregon has the lowest diesel standards on the west coast and that we live right next door to a huge diesel rail yard. 

All over Oregon citizens live in ""worst case"" scenarios. We have next to no protection from our DEQ. People are not suffering in abstract ways as a result. They are suffering in massive and extended ways. It is not that some people are unlucky and get cancer. Or some kids have asthma and can't handle the air. No, Oregon's terrible air quality diminishes the well-being of every single citizen to a greater or lesser degree every day. We are not only more likely to be susceptible to serious life threatening diseases we are also, all of us, more likely to catch colds, to spend more days in bed sick, to have a harder time learning (the link between cognitive impacts and pollution is now well understood, c.f. California’s citing rules about roads and schools), and to be depressed (the link between mood and pollution is also well established). 

Oregon is famous for planning and its dedication to a healthy environment. The fact that our air quality rules are so abysmal is an utter embarrassment. Now the cat is out of the bag. For too long people thought that the fact we have lots of trees meant we have clean air. Now everyone knows better. We have long had some of the worst air quality in the country but Cleaner Air Oregon offers us a unique opportunity to strive to have some of the best air quality! We need to make this an historic moment where we right a terrible wrong. It is essential that the CAO rules not be gutted and de-clawed.

Here are key elements that must be attended to:

•NO to 500 cancers per million. We might as well not have a cap at all.

•The Director of the DEQ must NOT have the discretion and final authority to allow a facility to pollute. That must be decided based on the evaluation of a panel and should be back-up by science with human health given priority.

•It is the EXISTING facilities that are literally killing us here in Oregon. Existing facilities must have the same health standards as new facilities. Exempting existing facilities from the same rules creates a loophole that will encourage companies to keep existing facilities going even though they pollute most. This is a dangerous loophole and would leave most of Portland's pollution problems in place. 

•DEQ has proposed to measure and cap air pollution in communities surrounding industrial facilities. For this program to be truly protective of public health, the area cap program must include community sources like traffic and construction diesel emissions

•Low-income and

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

I am particularly concerned about the Jordan Cove Project proposed on Coos Bay. This will add tons of methane and other pollutants into our pristine coastal air and since it is upwind from the largest population on the coast will have a wide negative effect.

I have research data that shows human intelligence is dropping worldwide at a rate of .6 I.Q. points per year.  In 50 years, the average will drop from 100 to 70, at which point half the world's adults will be unemployable and none will be smart enough to graduate from college.  There is also evidence that air pollution is damaging the prefrontal lobes in humans, and that damage to this area is associated with increased aggression/anger management problems.  There is further significant correlation between air pollution as measured by the World Health Organization and amount of war in nations as measured by a data file at the U. of Princeton.

My family has lived less than 1/2 mile from the Daimler Truck painting facility on Swan Island for 25 years.  Before we bought our home on Wellesley Avenue, I asked the owner if there were any toxic fumes from the industry on Swan Island.  He told us there were not, but in our first winter in the home, 1993 - 1994, we began to smell the paint fumes from the truck painting on Swan Island.  We even smelled the paint  inside our home, before the house was weatherized.  Walking in the neighborhood, i had to put a cloth over my nose and mouth when the paint fumes came down our street, the odor was so horrible!  It was like being in the paint booth, but we were about  1/4 mile away from the exhaust stacks!  
 
We talked to neighbors, went to meetings with the DEQ and Daimler Trucks, reported the odors, smelled the stink every winter, but nothing improved.  New young families with young children moved into our neighborhood about 9 - 10 years ago, and they smelled the paint, too!  We started to organize and meet with Daimler again.  They did change their paint ingredients, and instead of painting 120 trucks per day they were painting less than 50 trucks per day.  This helped.  But we still smell the paint every winter and cannot be outside when trucks are being painted!!  Its gotten to the point that when i breath humid winter air in Portland, i'm afraid to take a deep breath because i'm afraid it could be laced with toxic paint stink.! 

Today Daimler still uses isocyanates in their paint products!!  Isocyanate paints cause cancer and are neurotoxic!!  Daimler recently built a huge new 5 or 6 story  headquarters on Swan Island, and they claim they do not have enough money to filter the toxic fumes from their paint exhaust???  How can that be?  Profits over People is the destruction of livable cities and livable neighborhoods!!  North Portland deals with petroleum fumes from the tank farms across the Willamette River, and toxic air from the Malarkey Roofing Company across Columbia Blvd.,  that gives people headaches, plus fumes from other industry and cars in this city.  The time has come to implement regulations that  decrease the accumulative effect of all this air pollution that is so close to residential homes!!!!  How can you go to sleep in a neighborhood were you cannot open your windows at night?  

Existing Facilities in our neighborhoods need to be held to the same health standards as those propsed for new facilities!!!!

Portland is more crowded with cars and thus air pollution, than it was 20 years ago!!  Air Pollution control is more important than ever in this century!!!

Industry has the money to filter their pollution!  Why can't they get a little economic incentive, like a tax break the first year they put filters on their stacks?

It is my understanding that the Draft Air Program Rules have been watered down from the Cleaner Air Oregon program, specifically nuisance implimentation policy.  Response to nuisance complaints needs be part of the CAO program!

The proposed CAO rules allow a source to request a PTE or a risk limit to demonstrate compliance with the applicable Source Risk Action Levels.  OAR 340-245-0080.  Bullseye requests that DEQ clarify that requesting a PTE or risk limit for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the applicable Source Risk Level Action does not trigger the Risk Reduction Plan requirements under OAR 340-245-0220.  If a source does not meet applicable Source Action Risk Levels, a source can voluntarily request a PTE or risk limit and avoid the Risk Reduction Plan process.  As currently drafted, it is not clear whether requesting a PTE or risk limits automatically triggers the Risk Reduction Plan requirements.   We do not believe this was DEQâ€™s intent.
Comment No. 6
As currently drafted, it is unclear whether the source or DEQ decides which Source Risk Assessment level will be performed.  The discretion should be with the source, not DEQ.  OAR 340-245-0200 (Modeling Requirements) and 340-245-0210 (Comprehensive Health Risk Assessment Procedure) should be revised accordingly.  Bullseye requests that DEQ revise the first sentences of OAR 340-245-0200 and OAR 340-245-0210 to read:
(1) If the owner or operator of a source elects to [perform modelling]/[conduct a Comprehensive Health Risk Assessment]
Comment No. 7
Under proposed OAR 340-245-0080, DEQ requires that the Source Risk Assessments be completed using â€œpre-existing PTE.â€&#65533;  For De Minimis sources, the proposed rule requires that the source assess air toxic emissions at the â€œcapacity to emit of each TEU.â€&#65533;  The â€œcapacity to emit of each TEUâ€&#65533; is not defined and theoretically could be greater than â€œPre-existing PTE.â€&#65533;  The purpose of the program should be to access actual risk--not theoretical risk or require a source to propose a reduction plan or a TBACT Plan to address a theoretical risk.  Bullseye requests that DEQ revise OAR 340-245-0080 to determine risk based on actual emissions or (at the discretion of a source) a projected maximum, not a pre-existing PTE or â€œcapacity to emit.â€&#65533;  By evaluating risk based on actual emissions, DEQ, a source and the public will be better informed in their decision making process.  Further, it is not clear how emissions are to be evaluated when the toxic emissions units are connected to a common exhaust or emissions control device.  Emissions and associated risk should be determined at the point where air toxics are emitted to the ambient air and any evaluation should take into consideration any emissions control equipment or other operational restrictions that could limit emissions.  Prior to submitting a Source Risk Assessment, DEQ and the source should first complete the steps under OAR 340-245-0340 and agree on the emissions inventory and modelling information that will be used in the Source Risk Assessment.  This will ensure that the results of the Source Risk Assessments are representative of the actual risk associated with the source.  Failure to first agree on an accurate emissions inventory and/or modelling, will lead to unrepresentative results.  The submittal deadlines under OAR 340-245-0050 should be revised, as appropriate, to allow the source and DEQ to first agree on the emissions inventory and modelling before any risk assessment is performed and submitted.

DeAnna,Bolding,r_dbolding@hotmail.com,,Oregon,"As a union member of United Steelworkers Local 1097 and an employee of the Georgia-Pacific tissue mill in Wauna, Oregon, Iâ€™m proud that my union and my company values our environment, our community and our health. We have a proven record of complying with federal, state and local rules and regulations to protect public and environmental health, including multiple federal rules that already regulate the same sorts of air pollutants that Oregonâ€™s program would.   I work at the facility and see first-hand how seriously USW Local 1097 employees and the company take protecting the environment.

The regulatory and financial burden imposed by Cleaner Air Oregon, which would be the strictest in the country, may prevent our facility from making the capital investments needed to maintain our competitiveness. Already, our facility is at a competitive disadvantage to other paper mills in the Midwest and Southern states that have lower energy, wood supply and transportation costs.  

Oregon employers, including Georgia-Pacific, already have improved our environment and protected public and employee health by reducing air contaminants. Due to substantial investments in pollution control technology, Oregon industrial sources now account for less than 15 percent of air pollutants.

These excessive, overreaching regulatory standards must be revised.  This program is in response to a Portland-area issue and based on unrealistic, hypothetical health outcomes that does not take into account the health impact of job losses on rural Oregon.  Poorly conceived rules and requirements can have devastating consequences on rural Oregon businesses.

The proposed CAO rules allow DEQ to request from any source an emissions inventory and modelling information.  OAR 340-245-0340.  Under the proposed regulation, a source has 30 days (subject to a 60-day extension) to submit the requested information.  As a preliminary matter, a source and DEQ should first agree on a plan of what will go into the emissions inventory.  Not all sources are identical and the prescriptive requirements under OAR 340-245-0340 may not apply to all source.  Second, the proposed rule seems to only allow the use of reported emissions factors to determine emissions.  Sources should have the option of using (or completing) stack testing to determine actual emission rates.  Lastly, there is no connection between OAR 340-245-0340 and completing a Source Risk Assessment under OAR 340-245-0080.  As discussed above, DEQ and the source should first reach agreement on the emissions inventory and modelling before completing the Source Risk Assessment.  This will result in more accurate data regarding actual risk.
Comment No. 10
The proposed CAO rules allow DEQ to request from any source an emissions inventory and modelling information.  The information that can be requested is not just â€œemissions dataâ€&#65533; but includes production, fuel and material usage rates; projected maximum daily and annual production and process rates; operating schedules and other information.  There are no provisions under the proposed CAO rules to protect confidential business information.  OAR 340-245-0340 should be revised to include a reference to OAR 340-214-0130 (Information exempt from Disclosure).
 
Comment No. 11
The proposed CAO rules allow DEQ to provide a notice of deficiency to an inventory report and, upon receipt of a revised and resubmitted inventory, modify the inventory report as â€œDEQ deems appropriate.â€&#65533;  A source should have a right to challenge DEQâ€™s determination of a deficiency as well as any final decision.  The proposed rules should be revised to indicate that any decision made by DEQ under OAR 340-245-0340 can be challenged as a contested case proceeding under OAR 340-011.
Comment No. 12
Tables 3 and 5 of the proposed CAO rules are critical in determining potential risk.  There are multiple errors in the tables.  For example, the acute non-cancer risk for manganese is reported as less than the chronic non-residential non-cancer risk.  As noted in Table 5, soluble nickel compounds are considered less potent than insoluble nickel compounds, yet the chronic risk based concentration for soluble nickel compounds is less than the chronic risk based concentration for insoluble nickel compounds.  DEQ needs to get the thresholds risk values and risk based concentrations correct.  Before any final rule is published, the threshold risk values and risk based concentrations should be fully evaluated and verified by an independent committee like the existing Air Toxic Science Advisory Committee or a separate, independent group of toxicologists.
Comment No. 13
OAR 340-245-0310 requires that compliance with the acute and chronic Source Risk Limits must be determined monthly.  The regulations fail to describe how a source is required to make this monthly determination.  It would be unduly burdensome and economically infeasible to require that every source (including de minimis sources) verify and update each month residential and nonresidential exposure locations and then re-run the Source Risk Assessment described under proposed OAR 340-245-0080 to determine compliance.

Finally, I live in the Rose City Park neighborhood where large amounts of arsenic were detected in 2016.  Promises by DEQ were made over a year ago to conduct additional testing.  So far nothing has been done to address this issue. I suspect that part of the problem is that there are so many other areas in Portland that have a critical need for action to address toxic air issues.  In addition, I was appalled to learn that despite aggressive action by Washington and California to address issues around diesel pollution the only action by Oregon is to accept these polluters with open arms and to decline to regulate.  I do not accept the explanation that it is too expensive regulate these sources of pollution.  We have some of the worst air in the nation.  For a state that purports to be as green as Portland does, that is outrageous.

Dear Mr. Westersund:

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations.

Also, inner city Portlanders are bearing the brunt of outdated diesel standards which I see every day when I look at the soot on my windowsills.  I breathe air that impacts my health, because I have asthma now.  I did not have this problem when I lived outside the city limits in a place with lots of trees around my home.  

I just read an article about London, that they have met lower regulatory standards for the first time in 10 years because they limited diesel vehicles in the city.  Why can't we do the same?  Read for yourself:  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-42681113

Oregon lags behind our neighboring states, who have already taken action to protect the health of their constituents. Oregon's air quality is some of the very worst IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

Not only did I suffer from asthma for 50 years, and then finally find relief, but the air quality of Southern Oregon during the summer months is already compromised by seasonal smoke from fires.  Anything more, chemicals, etc. would make this area unlivable for many.

Ralph,Grutzmacher,ralph.grutzmacher@gmail.com,none,Oregon,"I am a resident of Toledo, Oregon, the site of Georgia-Pacific's containerboard mill.  I am also a former member of the City Council and a former mayor of the City.  My home overlooks the mill from a distance of less than 400 meters.  I presume that I am of the class of people Cleaner Air Oregon is designed to protect.  However, I urge the Department to reconsider the proposed rules and the state-wide application of those proposed rules, especially with respect to existing manufacturing facilities that are permitted under the Clean Air Act and operating in compliance with such permits.  Cleaner Air Oregon needs to be balanced by the economic impact upon existing facilities and upon anticipated expansion and modernization of such facilities.  The proposed rules rely upon math modeling and impose upon every existing facility a requirement to initiate and maintain modeling.  While modeling is certainly an appropriate method to evaluate proposed facilities it is redundant for existing permitted facilities and adds additional operating expenses without improving air quality.  

The Georgia-Pacific Toledo Mill is one of four such mills operated by Georgia-Pacific in the United States.  In its 60 years of operations, the mill has undergone numerous improvements to reduce its discharges into the air and water and has remained within its permitted emissions limits.  I am concerned that adding the costs of compliance with the proposed rules may adversely impact investment decisions made in Atlanta and reduce or eliminate this very significant economic engine located in Toledo and Lincoln County.    The Toledo Mill directly employs about 400 salaried and hourly employees with an annual payroll of approximately $45 million.  Transportation employment, service contractor employment and the purchase of raw materials, including waste forest products and  one half million tons of waste cardboard, account for another $300 million of economic impact for Lincoln County and Oregon.  

All business must be able to depend upon a fair and appropriate regulatory environment to continue to provide economic stability for themselves and the communities in which they operate.  The proposed rules add no additional protections to the environment, but add a significant cost for compliance with untested theories and modeling.  I am unable to competently comment on the components of modeling (others have critical comments about the underlying methods and measurements) but it appears that an existing facility can be measured, rather than modeled, to determine its compliance with permit requirements.

The proposed regulations add another layer of burden to existing businesses and facilities that will result in reductions of investment for modernization and reconstruction.  The declines in investment will accelerate the date of facility closures as facilities become economically  obsolete.  The economic and social costs of premature facility closure and abandonment will be devastating to Toledo and Lincoln County.  One only needs to ask, if Georgia-Pacific Toledo Mill and other facilities around the state close and stop employing people, stop purchasing raw materials and stop paying taxes, who will be paying the very taxes and fees that fund the Department of Environmental Quality?

Please set strong guidelines for clean air.  We rely on government to protect our air and water, and Oregon needs to lead the way to make our air quality standards tops in the nation.  There is no excuse to leave them short of that standard.  Business will adapt and still make money, but people cannot adapt to dirty air.

We live a short distance from a factory that clearly pollutes heavy metals.  My wife has lived and worked close to this plant for over 20 years.  She developed a deadly, aggressive form of cancer that has been linked to cadmium and other heavy metals.  Her cancer was no accident or bad luck.

Diesel is another problem altogether.  As our roadways are ever more congested, the diesel fumes are more concentrated near highways and busy streets.  

Our way of life is killing us through the horrible air quality that we choose to tolerate.  Only our government can help with this issue and must do so without catering to the polluters.  Yes, jobs are important, but human health and lives must always come first.

When Oregon has some of the worst airshed in the nation, with high diesel particulate and benzene levels, it seems to be a dichotomy that Oregon considers itself a green state, more like a"" green washing"" state.

According to the Smoke Stack Report we have some of the worst air in the nation in several of our schools, Our diesel particulate is some of the highest  and our legislature seems continually fail at correcting  the problem. When trucks from Oregon are not allowed into Washington and California and old polluting diesel engines are dumped for their continued use in our state because they fail to meet other states pollution standards. When Dr. Linda George PSU tells us more people die from diesel particulate than smoking cigarettes, it's time for a call to action.

I live in the Linnton Neighborhood of Portland, where our health and livability are negatively impacted by industries air pollution.  The synergistic and cumulative effects are never taken into effect when  permitting air pollution. We live in a Superfund site with volatilization of PCBs and PAHs to name only two occur. Dr Daniel Carpenter of Albany University New York studies show that people living within 5 miles of a Superfund Site have significant health issues from volitizing PCBs. At a recent Linnton neighborhood association meeting, the Portland Traffic Police told us that St Helens Rd.(Hwy 30) is called ""dirty 30', because of the large volume and ever increasing truck traffic that uses Hwy. 30, a large part of which are illegal, either overweight or have issues with safety and/or pollution standards . They travel on Hwy 30 to avoid the City of Vancouver, Washington inspection station by crossing the Longview bridge.The only ODOT inspection station in Multnomah County, which is north of Linnton is rarely and only randomly open and south bound traffic has no inspection station  The huge volume of trucks traffic significantly  contributes to  diesel particulates , with Hwy 30 cutting through the middle of our neighborhood.  

I spend countless hours trying to help  Oregon be green and improve the health and livability of our communities. I have been a member of the Portland Harbor Community Advisory Group since 2005. I am on the board of the North West Toxics Community Coalition for EPA region 10. I am on the board of the Linnton Neighborhood association for many years.  I care about my communities airshed, water and livability and would hope that the state would also. It's time to ""step of to the plate"" and pass regulations to clean our air.

My name is Catherine and I am a resident of the Overlook neighborhood in North Portland. My neighborhood suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the Portland metro area. We have major highways in our neighborhood, as well as major industry  on Swan Island and in NW Portland. 

We often smell strong solvent/chemical odors in the neighborhood and Iâ€™ve reported toxic odors to DEQ many times but I havenâ€™t felt heard by decision makers or felt my reporting has had an impact.  I am a mother and have developed asthma in the last 10 years since I moved to Portland. I need you to take the health of my family and neighbors seriously.

In order to truly protect public health,  the area cap monitoring must account for pollution from all polluters of air toxics, regardless of the source. We need a focus on clean air, letting existing facilities operate under different standards does not address our air quality, it addresses the bottom line of the polluter.  In addition, I donâ€™t want the health of my family in the hands of one director who can over-ride policy without a clear and collaborative process. We need a focus on public health, not industry.

I live in residential Northwest Portland which is next to the industrial part of town where Esco has been allowed to pollute dangerous metals into the air our because DEQâ€™s regulations did not prevent them from doing this. Families from this neighborhood and children attending Chapman Elementary just 3 blocks away have had to breath metal filled air day after day because health has not been a priority for DEQ.  At a time when the worldâ€™s environment is threatened by the current US president who protects business over people, our state must step up to improve our environmental quality to protect the health of our people, now and for the future. 

CLEANER AIR OREGON could be a bold program that drives industry innovation in emission controls by setting clear health standards to ensure that all Oregon communities have healthy clean safe air.  

However, under successful pressure from industry, the Cleaner Air Oregon program was watered down from the promised health-based program with well-defined and strong health standards, to one that instead prioritizes the profit margins of regulated facilities. 

If we actually want Cleaner Air Oregon to protect Oregonians from bad air, there are some issues that need to be fixed.

Existing facilities should have the same health standards as proposed new facilities. The different standards between existing and new facilities shifts the focus away from public health. The public is affected by toxic emissions regardless of a facilityâ€™s age.
The program currently proposes a hard cap of 500 cancer deaths per million people per facility, beyond which permits will not be granted. This does not support or encourage innovation or improvement, and is essentially the same as no cap, potentially allowing an offending industry to avoid mitigation or curtailment.
The  innovative area cap program should be brought back into the plan.  It originally included consideration of community sources, such as diesel and construction-related emissions, as well as multiple industrial sources impacting one community.  The cap on emissions for a neighborhood should include the sum of all sources of pollution.  Not just that from an industry. New polluting industry should not be allowed to be sited in neighborhoods that already have air pollution beyond that cap.

Thank you for standing up for our peopleâ€™s health and not for industry. Please consider these changes to make Cleaner Air Oregon a visionary program.

I am an Oregonian who believes our state needs solid, health-based regulations with reasonable limits to toxic emissions. 

As a community advocate who has spent hundreds of hours working to encourage local industrial facilities to decrease their impact on surrounding communities, I've come to see first-hand how much diverse, low income communities are at a disadvantage when trying to engage corporations to be better neighbors and stewards of the environment. Without strong regulations to protect the public interest, disadvantaged communities face disproportionate impacts.

I live on a one-acre organic farm with my 82-year old Mother, my daughter, and my 25-year old disabled son.  We are surrounded by grass fields and large farms owned by corporations.  All of these fields are sprayed, either by plane, by truck or by hand.  ODA has confirmed that we have been 'dusted' with the chemicals used, but assured us that the amounts weren't harmful.  But what about our right to not be contaminated by ANY amount of poison???

I am lobbying for a COMPLETE overhaul of protections for us human beings:  THE MOMENT AN ORGANIC SOLUTION IS FOUND THAT CAN REPLACE HARMFUL CHEMICALS -- NO MATTER THE COST -- THE HARMFUL CHEMICAL SHOULD BE OUTLAWED IMMEDIATELY.   If a company cannot afford to operate using safe products, that company should not be in business.  Period.   No more lame excuses that ignore the cost of caring for a poisoned population.  If you're an elected official and you are more worried about corporate interests lining your pockets than you are about listening to and working for your constituents, you WILL lose your job.

Melissa,Di Rito,sisterveda@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

If the air we breathe is toxic how can Oregon be known as a ""green"" place to live or a livable place at all? When the news came out about Bullseye Glass my Portland bubble was burst. We live within half a mile from Bullseye and a few blocks from the busy and polluted Powell Blvd. We have a 3 year old and I am worried about his health as he grows up in Portland. I'm from a small town in Colorado where air quality is a value. We live a very healthy lifestyle by eating only local, organic foods. We exercise outside as much as possible and we love being a part of the Portland community. I want to believe that it's possible to live in an urban environment that's not poisoned from industry standards being too lax. I would hope that a good conscience and common sense would drive business owners to make them do their part to not poison their community but the bottom line all too often becomes the focus. This must change. They must be held accountable and make their processes earth friendly or they are put out of business. 

It is VITAL to the health of this community and the greater Oregon area that we have solid forward thinking, earth/people/animal friendly regulations that protect us from harm. Portland and Oregon need to step up their game in proving that we are leaders in environmental change. The people and the community demand this! It is a basic human right to have clean air to breathe. It is you and your team's job to fix this broken system and get Oregon back on the right track. Diesel pollution and industry pollution must be eradicated!

Emily,B.,,,Oregon,"As someone who has dedicated their career to the environmental field, I support the protection of our citizens, but I urge the state to reassess their rushed approach to legislation of this scope and sensitivity.  I work with air quality on a daily basis and how it affects employee's health, and participated in the Bullseye Glass fiasco when it hit Portland.  It absolutely shed light on the need for air quality reassessment. But from someone who has also worked in large industry, the stringent timelines for emission mapping, the inflexibility of making expansion and modifications to company buildings, and the overall state-wide rush that will come with this regulation will cause confusion, non-compliance, and potentially pushback or aversion from companies trying to comply.  I believe in the changes, but I also urge better planning and timeline flexibility for companies who will be trying to do the right thing to meet these new standards.  30 days, 90 days, etc. for very expensive large scale changes in many prominent Oregon-supporting businesses will be stressful and probably unreasonable.  With a state-wide conversion to much more stringent standards, it will be important to keep progressing, but to do so in a manner that accounts for both business and public health needs.  Support change, but take the time to account for the logistics of Oregon business and how 1-3-6 month turnaround for enormous changes can be nearly impossible when we don't have enough consultants in the state to even begin the first stages of assessing air toxics for Oregon industries.

One of the â€˜best retirement placesâ€™ websites had indicated good quality air, although I admit that was a decade ago.  Now, it feels different.  Aside from fires, which have really created havoc, other problems seem â€˜in the wind.â€™  At times, it has warranted me taking lung tonic substances.  I fear more must be done. 

I realize that other states do not have a â€œRisk Action Level Capâ€&#65533; as proposed in the rules.  I think this is an excellent concept, even if the risk ceiling is too high. Additionally I understand that only 80 of Oregonâ€™s more than 2,500 companies will be included during the first 5 years.  We need funding to hire personnel to enact the rules and finish the inventory, which I understand is not complete.  And there is the rub.

I, my son, and my wife live within a couple of blocks of the Hollingworth & Vose glassfiber plant in Corvallis.  Consequently, we live in their waste stream.  In particular, the superfine particles their filtration doesn't catch are in our air.  This is probably the reason my eyes burn, my skin itches, and I cough on a regular cycle.  My doctor was able to find nothing wrong and concluded that the problem was air pollution.  

Consequently, I have a personal interest in better environmental regulation in Oregon.  I don't want my neighbors or fellow citizens in other places subjected to industrial wastes, either.  Regulation should be based entirely on the impact on public health and the natural environment, the more stringent the better.

Although permits are issued to particular facilities, it is the resulting amount of toxics in the air we breathe that matters. For this reason, all sources within an area that contribute to pollution must be considered, whether they are from a permitted facility, or from transportation, residential, or construction sources. All facilities, whether existing  or new, need to have the same health standards. Regulations should apply to everyone when the regulations are adopted. The rules shouldn't presuppose some extended time period for DEQ to process all the information that will come in from businesses.

I live one street over from both Columbia Park Annex and Willamette and I have smelled paint fumes from Daimler 4 times this week.  This has been an ongoing problem for this neighborhood and no one is doing anything about it.  There is a ""so what"" attitude from the Daimler people and a seeming lack of concern from DEQ.  I recently turned my garage into an ADU and they painted the front of the garage the same color that I painted my house when I first moved here.  I know that paint does change color, but it was a distinctly different color.  The old paint was much darker and an indication of how much silt is in our air.   I have been to meetings and even made a recorded statement a few years ago when several of us met with DEQ at U of Portalnd.  And still 4 times this week I smelled noxious paint fumes.

The lack of care for others, for neighborhoods, for the people and children who live and play in those neighborhoods is shocking.  It's time that something is done about  it.  

Please consider those of us who live in the neighborhoods above Swan Island , be concerned for our health and well being and do the right thing.  Please CLEAN UP OUR AIR.

Nothing says that more clearly than reading the â€˜Air Toxics reporting listâ€™ in your report.  Page after page.  Yes, some may not be worrisome, others that may have been with us for a long while, but on the whole this is a scary situation. 
One of the charts in your report states â€œAlternate Noncancer Risk Action Levels (ANRAL) reflect the fact that there is variability around the severity of health effects and magnitude of uncertainty reflected in noncancer Risk-Based Concentrations for different air toxics.â€&#65533;  Another section says â€œThe DEQ Director must consider air toxic-specific concerns with exceeding noncancer Risk Action Levels prior to allowing an Alternate Noncancer Risk Action Level for any permit above default Risk Action Levels.â€&#65533;  If it is not obvious, this shows the help that the public needs.

I live in North Portland.  We share our space with industry, two major traffic corridors, Columbia Blvd and Lombard, besides the I-5 corridor.  Few regulatory practices are monitored and/or enforced, specifically with the emissions of ORRCO and APES.  Much of the reporting information can be found between neighbors asking one another What is that smell? on Nextdoor.  Other neighbors have organized a presence upon DEQ, since not much else is currently being done.  Please know that regulation is needed, and appreciated, by ordinary folk that I live with.  Allowing certain regulatory practices to lapse has been the hallmark of DEQ in my area.  We take this situation very seriously.  There are far too many days when air wafts toxic right into our homes, not to mention the schools and parks and elders lying in the path of these fumes.

I request that the health standards be upheld for all old/existing facilities that are the same for proposed new facilities. We need to start making human health the driver for regulatory action. The concern for emissions from Portland glass companies was a fantastic start, and we cannot back down from regulating and investigating industry activity that may threaten human health. Low income /vulnerable communities are impacted more severely than wealthier communities - DEQ needs to be sure those individuals understand the situation and can share their opinions too. Please make emissions requirements tougher- industry should not contribute to more cases of cancer- there are already enough causes of cancer without allowing for industrial causes, and the downstream effects on others exposed to polluted water and air are not measured by the proposed emissions cap of 500 cancers per million people.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. My neighborhood, Lents, is situated in the center of southeast Portlandâ€™s main thoroughfares. My son is just 2 years old, and I worry about him developing asthma from inhaling air pollution. My neighborhood always smells like car exhaust. 

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

These proposed rules will put thousands of our local businesses at risk, unnecessarily sacrificing middle Income jobs by going far beyond what any other state has imposed.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about taking my rights away to heat my home. I have wood heat and want to preserve my right to heat my home in the winter months. I have asmah if using this form of heat effected me I would certainly not use. This is the cheapest form of heat for my income.

Oregon needs to look at big industry and how they pollute, transportation and how the grid lock of cars running while stopped in grid lock. Lowering costs if electricity in a state that has low cost wind and water resources to provide power to make not using wood as a viable option. By taking away wood burning means lower income persons will be choosing between turning on other forms of high cost heat to include space heaters that are dangerous or providing food and other necessities.

As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules. 

Thank you.

I also think it is very important that the Forest Service and Blm and private timber sales are highly regulated for their spraying herbicide practices after timber harvests. This is a highly dangerous practice which effects water quality etc.

Cindy ,Young ,rocknrollschool@msn.com,EPAC,Oregon,One of the problems with the rules are there is no monitoring and business's basically police themselves. The fact that Bullseye and other industries in Oregon are not honest in their reporting or in how much or what toxics they're using. There is absolutely no way to keep industry honest without monitoring. DEQ is also under funded so unless they get adequate funding that will also inpeed investigations. The truth is a system that requires all Industry Title V and smaller companies to purchase monitoring equiptment that can be sent electronically to a mother ship program at DEQ is the only way to insure proof of our air quality. If you want a permit to do business in Portland you need to buy a monitor bottom line.,

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community, and of the entire world. 
World Health Organization data files are available for researchers to use.  I have used them, correlating this data with  I.Q. data for children around the world.  The higher the air pollution of a nation, the lower the I.Q. for that nation's children.  And the relationship is evident at age 5 and gets stronger every year up through the age of 25.
Air pollution also correlates with war frequency in nations, using Princeton U. data files on war activity since 1955.  Air pollution damages areas of the brain needed to constrain aggressive impulses.  Vietnam veterans with prefrontal lobe damage have this problem 35 years later.  The Middle East has some of the highest air pollution in the world, with the highest in Saudi Arabia.
We are slowly dying in a gas chamber of our own making.  Fossil fuel combustion exhaust is a primary source of air toxins.
Human I.Q. is dropping worldwide at a rate of .6 I.Q. points per year.  In 50 years, the average will drop from 100 to 70, and half the population will be mentally retarded.  None will be smart enough to graduate from quality universities.  Society as we know it will be impossible.

Jesse,Ford,jessebiz@peak.org,,OREGON,"I applaud your efforts to improve air quality in Oregon by closing regulatory gaps that affect human heath. There is much to celebrate in the proposed rulemaking.  

Three concerns, for the record: 
(1) It looks as if you are essentially pulling back oversight of  2,420 facilities considered not to be of highest risk. We know, however, that if a facility is not actively regulated, the business has no incentive to keep its emissions low. Doesn't this approach potentially set the stage for deterioration of  Oregon airsheds due to the multiplicity of lower risk facilities that will not be receiving regulatory oversight over the next five years? (2) Risk assessment on an analyte-by-analyte basis ignores potential synergistic effects (or the reverse!) in the cumulative effects setting of a well-mixed airshed. I encourage a focus on health risks of common *combinations* of air toxics. (3) Why is air permitted differently than water, which considers health of biota in addition to humans? Shouldn't this be changed at some point? 

Thank you for considering these comments, and for the work that you do to protect the health, safety, and beauty  of Oregon environments, for all our relations. ",
Arran,Robertson,ar@oregonwild.org,Oregon Wild,OR,"Please accept these 465 petition signatures from Oregonians.

Over 40 years after the passage of the federal Clean Air Act, Oregon is still facing major problems with air pollution.  As the recent scandal over heavy metals and other dangerous toxins near schools in Portland showed, current rules fail to protect our air, our environment, and our families.  Even worse, for decades Oregon logging companies have used their political political clout skirt environmental safeguards.

The Cleaner Air Oregon proposal offers a positive step towards addressing the many failures of Oregonâ€™s current system for regulating and controlling air pollution--but only if it fully addresses all sources of pollution, and does not perpetuate the broken system of ignoring pollution from politically powerful logging interests.

I urged the Department of Environmental Quality to ensure Cleaner Air Oregon rules:

Fully include logging-related industries in order to protect the families and communities that live near them.  There should be no carve outs or exemptions for politically well-connecting logging companies or mills.

No special treatment for Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) operations.  CLT mills are notorious for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and other toxics.

No exemptions for wood-burning biomass energy facilities.  Biomass plants pollute the air with soot, CO2, and other harmful emissions, and present serious health risks for people with asthma, the elderly, and young children.

Use the precautionary principle.  Where scientific uncertainty exists, err on the side of stronger, not weaker, pollution standards.

No loopholes for businesses based on size.  Pollution is toxic regardless of whether it comes from a facility with 500 employees or 25.",https://data.oregon.gov/views/gvv7-qhw2/files/e63e7020-7d7e-4193-8e3e-755922d21edc?filename=CleanerAir2017.pdf

Greg,Thelen,gkthelen@gmail.com,,Oregon,"We need cleaner air, and I believe the Cleaner Air Oregon draft proposal is a good start. As a concerned citizen I have followed the rulemaking process through the Technical Workgroup meetings and the Cleaner Air Oregon Advisory Committee processes, and the testimony of scientists and public health professionals is clear:  air toxics are quantifiable and have measurable adverse health effects. Virtually every health professional involved is on record proposing highly protective standards in the proposed CAO regulations. Industry representatives often either deny the science or use fear tactics in an attempt to protect their profits and to avoid taking responsibility for the harmful effects of their activities. But taking steps to not release toxics into the atmosphere is a cost of doing business that must be assumed by all businesses. As an Oregon taxpayer, I believe the funding for environmental regulation must be completely paid by the polluter. 
Cumulative health effects from multiple sources in a geographic area must be considered. There should be an upper limit of 50 in a million Cancer Index, and no greater than one in Hazard Index. All industries of all sizes must be regulated, whether new or existing, and with the same standards. Materials Balancing should be required for all companies handling toxics in order to reveal what is purchased and how it is used or disposed of. And finally, there should be some provision for Citizens to enforce the rules in case the State canâ€™t or wonâ€™t. Thank you for your dedicated work so far. Do not be disheartened by the powerful industry lobbyists who regularly influence Oregonâ€™s Legislators, and who now want to gut these rules through underfunding, as they have so often hindered the DEQâ€™s ability to operate successfully in the past.

Daniel,Jaffee,dsjaffee@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

My name is Dan Jaffee, and I live in the King neighborhood in Northeast Portland.  Over the 10 years I have lived in Portland, I frequently go outside to find overpowering noxious odors from polluting facilities, among them APES and NORRCO in North Portland.  Sometimes the odors are so strong that they enter my home with all windows closed.  I have called the DEQ Odor Line on many occasions, but never received meaningful follow-up from the agency on these complaints.

I have been alarmed to read of the extremely high rates of air toxics in my neighborhood and in all of the Portland area.  I am even more disturbed to read of DEQâ€™s chronic failure to alert the public to violations by industrial emitters such as APES, NORRCO, Precision Castparts, and Oroboros of their air permits, as well as its repeated failure to cite and/or penalize these firms for their wanton disregard of public health.  It is clear to me that this is a question of undue industry influence over the DEQ, and that the fox has been guarding the henhouse.  

This is why I was overjoyed when Governor Brown in 2016 promised us Cleaner Air Oregonâ€”which would include a new, health-based emissions regulation program that uses human health as the primary factor in developing regulatory action, not corporate profits.  However, I have been very concerned by what appears to be pressure from inside DEQ and from industry to weaken or eviscerate these new regulations before they are developed.   DEQ must uphold Gov. Brownâ€™s promise both by tracking the health impacts of pollution and by meaningfully reducing emissions that pose risk to Oregon families and communities.

I have specific comments on a few elements of the proposal: 

1. Director Discretion:  DEQ has proposed a system in which the DEQ Director has the final authority to decide if a facility can continue to pollute beyond the permitted limit.  This is a terrible proposal that violates the core priniciple of regulating based on risks to human health.  Under this proposal, the DEQ director is not required to have any expertise on public health.   
I urge you to remove this â€œdirector discretionâ€&#65533; loophole.

2.  Facility Emissions:  The program currently proposes a hard cap of 500 cancers per million people per facility, beyond which no permits will be granted.  This is a shocking, unacceptably high level of risk.   A cap of 500 cancers per million per facility is the same as having no cap whatsoever!  I urge you to lower this hard cap to only one (1) cancer per milllion people per facility.

3.  Existing Versus New Facilities:  All existing facilities must be held to the same health standards as proposed new facilities. The differing standards between existing and new facilities are not justified by any science, and appear to be merely a political handout to industry.  Because public health is affected by toxic emissions regardless of a facilityâ€™s age, you must eliminate any distinction between new and existing facilities in the regulations.

4.  Diesel Emissions:  I urge you to also include a diesel emission standard in Cleaner Air Oregon regulations.  It is unacceptable and tragic that Oregon has far lower diesel emissions standards than our neighbors Washington and California do, and that we have become a dumping ground for dirty, noncomplying diesel engines from those states.  

My health and that of my family is being harmed daily by the fact that Oregonâ€™s current air toxics regulations are so weak as to be virtually nonexistent.  I am hoping that DEQ will hear the voices of citizens who are absolutely sick and tired of being forced to inhale toxic emissions at a dramatically higher rate than almost anywhere in the U.S.  Are the lungs and bodies of Oregonâ€™s children and adults less valuable, less worth protecting than those who happen to live in neighboring states?

Please strengthen these draft regulations to provide genuinely meaningful protection for human health of Oregonians.

It is unacceptable and tragic that Oregon has far lower diesel emissions standards than our neighbors Washington and California do, and that we have become a dumping ground for dirty, noncomplying diesel engines from those states.  

 
I do not choose the air I breathe. Corporate interests and DEQ failure should not be able to decide whether or not I am exposed to carcinogens and particulate matter that causes cardiovascular disease. 

 

Please strengthen these draft regulations to provide genuinely meaningful protection for human health of Oregonians.

Julie,DiLeone,pdxjad@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I live in North Portland, and often smell fumes from the nearby industrial area. I strongly feel that the State of Oregon needs to prioritize the health of it's residents over the demands of the industrial lobby. Our land use laws allow for industrial areas to be next to neighborhoods. This makes it even more important that industry does everything possible to minimize pollution.

In my opinion, many of Oregonâ€™s environmental regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change.  The strategy of polluters in this state is to pay lobbyists to pressure the legislators to strip the teeth out of our laws and under fund our enforcement agencies by  threatening the lose of  jobs. Please continue to stand up to industry even under this threat and the threat of law suits. Our health depends on it.

I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

In addition, I urge you to make the industrial permits and applications available online to improve transparency and public access to this crucial information. In this day and age, it is ridiculous that the burden is on the public to make an appointment and go to a DEQ or city office to access this public information.

Hello, while the CAO program is a step in the right direction, it could be so much better.

The draft air program rules have been significantly watered down from the original suggested program.  I would ask that you make CAO program stronger and restore the original draft Air Program Rules.  The current rules do the same old thing and support industry.  This is not a question of jobs vs health.  We know that this is not a job killer.  We want strong, robust health based standards.  Industry does not need to put profit over people.  Vigor Industries has made significant voluntary changes to decrease emissions, diesel and odors.  They worked and continue to work with the neighborhood by signing a Good Neighbor Agreement and putting it in their Title V permit so they are required by law to make these changes.  They are thriving despite making positive changes and are even voluntarily making these changes at their other plants.  Emissions can be lowered without killing job.

I have been working on trying to clean up North Portland's air (really everyone's air in Portland) for the past 6+years.  I find it maddening that old companies are grandfathered in and not held to the same standards that new companies are in their permits.  I want best possible technology used to protect my family from the isocyanate paints that are coming out of Daimler's truck plant with no special equipment installed to remove these isocynates (cancer causing and neurotoxic) into our neighborhood which we smell and breathe on a daily basis.  Due to these paint odors there are often times that we go inside from playing outdoors and enjoying our yard and neighborhood.  We find our eyes and nose burning from the paint odors.  We get headaches from breathing the paint odors.  My asthma has become so bad that I am finding my self in urgent care multiple times during the winter and three times just last month.  I did not grow up with asthma, but was diagnosed after moving to and living in Portland for 10 years.  I can only feel the lax emission standards of Oregon contributed to my diagnosis.
Despite multiple odor reports over the past 6 years, nothing has changed despite a nusiance investigation regarding Daimler.  How does the new CAO program deal with nusiance?  I would specifically request that the new CAO program support the current program to respond to nusiance complaints.  We know that the emissions from Swan Island directly impact our University Park neighborhood since the odors are a significant indicator of where emissions travel.

Please make the necessary changes to the CAO rules to restore them to the original stronger health based standards that they were intended in an attempt to protect my and my family's health.  Only then will you be ensuring that ALL communities are safer and healthier in Oregon.

Keith,Iding,kedi@hevanet.com,Mr.,Oregon,"I am keeping my comment simple, because I know you have a lot of input to consider.
I worked for the Oregon DEQ Lab for over 20 years in Air Quality Monitoring, helping to assess EPA standards, and it was always frustrating to know that the criteria and toxics numbers we were getting didn't go far enough to ensure public health and safety were protected.  I am very much in favor of shifting from national compromised standards to localized health based standards, reflecting actual health impacts and evolving health based data.
Which ever specifics are adopted, I am most interested in shifting to this new partnership opportunity to involve the Oregon Health Authority in a new health standards based monitoring plan.  This would be an extremely valuable move for the future of public health, for the sake of our kids and our most frail citizens, as well as the rest of us.  Let's put health first over the economics, and find a way to make polluters pay their true costs.  Thank you!",
Deb,Lowenthal,DebL2602@aol.com,,Oregon,"DEQ and Cleaner Air Oregon are chartered to advocate for environmental quality and all rules should reflect that.  Of course, that means good quality â€“ not acceptance of a lower quality than we can achieve.  Rules should not focus on job market impact or convenience of the industry lobbyists â€“ balancing differing interests is the job of the legislature and the governor.   While EQC and DEQ are advocates for the environment, others have the role of advocating for business interests.  Impact on job markets can be interpreted in different ways. While some business may claim they canâ€™t afford to comply with good environmental policy, weâ€™ve seen that claim is often not the case as many companies thrive and increase profits, as well as EQC & DEQ should not be in the business of subsidizing failing companies.  If a business canâ€™t afford to operate cleanly and without harming the community, they should not be operating and probably are on borrowed time anyway.  You need to accept that the future economy and job market is green.  Good environmental policy IS good economic policy. 

Oregon is seen as a â€˜greenâ€™ state, a beautiful natural wonder and a clean, healthy place to live â€“ that is our brand.  If we do not protect our resources and our people, we will be outed as betraying this brand we project â€“ and that will not be good for Oregon business and growth.

Good environmental policy is focused on rules based on the health of the environment and the health of the community, monitoring for compliance, enforcement with consequences that impact, and zero-tolerance for pollution-induced illness.  We should not be negotiating the number of acceptable cases of cancer, that would otherwise not have occurred, due to industrial poison output.  You must look at your children and their friends and your neighbors â€“ and accept that it could be one of them.  And then you must refuse to accept that.  As someone who has been battling a mystery disease for over seven years since I moved into the Bullseye Glass neighborhood, I can tell you that I grieve for the life I lost for the mistake I made â€“ though I did nothing wrong. Not only have I endured the medical treatment â€“ 7 years of steroids and chemotherapy and surgeries â€“ but my career was stopped as well because I moved to the wrong part of Portland.

You must be, and the rules you make must be, advocates for the benefit of a healthy environment that supports healthy citizens â€“ NO mitigation for other concerns â€“ strictly focused on what the name of your commission labels you â€“ environmental quality

Thomas,Karwaki,karwaki@yahoo.com,University Park Neighborhood Association,Oregon,"The Board of Directors of the University Park Neighborhood Association request that DEQ consider the following comments on its Cleaner Air Oregon rules.  UPNA represents over 8,500 residents in North Portland on the Willamette Bluff including the University of Portland  It lies above Swan Island and is just north of most of the fuel and chemical tank farms south of the Willamette River, glass and other manufacturers and receives massive volumes of diesel emissions from Swan Island and I-5.

First, to truly be effective diesel emissions need to be considered.  North Portland has the highest emissions in the state. These emissions are directly linked to manufacturing on Swan Island as demonstrated in air basin modelling done by the University of Portland.  In fact diesel emissions dropped significantly when Vigor Shipyards voluntarily switched to shore electrical power rather than marine engines for the vessels it repairs.  DEQ should examine and incentivize this type of behavior by private firms and the Ports.  

Second, UPNA is a rapidly diversifying neighborhood with over 20 languages so the DEQ Clean Air rules and public engagement materials should be translated into at least the 8 major languages suggested by the Portland Office of Neighborhood Involvement.

Third,Facility Emissions:  The program proposes a hard cap of 500 cancers per million people per facility, beyond which permits will not be granted. This does not support or encourage innovation or improvement, and is essentially the same as no cap. 
 Fourth, Existing vs. New Facilities: Existing facilities should have the same health standards as proposed new facilities. Our neighborhood is affected by toxic emissions regardless of a facilityâ€™s age. In fact the older facilities emit more emissions.

UPNA and Arbor Lodge NA has a Good Neighbor Agreement with Vigor  Shipyards as well as Neighbors for Clean AIr.  This GNA provides a mechanism for the community to be educated about the operations of Vigor, its emissions, and the costs and technologies involved in reducing the emissions.  DEQ should incentivize companies to implement similar GNAs so that community can be involved in developing and monitoring an Emissions Reduction Plan.  Community members can be involved in decisions that affect jobs and air quality.  The GNA creates a framework for company-community dialogue and problem solving that would work well in a Cap and Trade system.   
    If you have questions about these comments, please contact Tom Karwaki, former UPNA Chair and Vice Chair and current Chair of the Land Use and Transportation Committee.

It troubles me to no end that a state that as far as public relations & tourism goes, appears to pride itself on its choices as far as the environment goes, and yet we continually allow industry to dictate the terms of regulation and underfund/understaff those entities tasked with enforcement. 

Practice what you preach!

On another note, I believe that industry can coexist with neighbors in areas of higher populations however, those industry's must not only listen to the concerns of their neighbors as it relates to their business practices but, address them in ways that are long term, meaningful and based on best practices not financial models. 

Please do more, stop treating citizens of this state with such disregard when it comes to clean air.

I wholeheartedly support adopting Cleaner Air Oregon's health-based regulations to protect people and the environment from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules.

Joe Westersund,

I wholeheartedly support adopting Cleaner Air Oregon's health-based regulations to protect people and the environment from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules. 

Thank you.

My children and my community deserve clean air, and I don't give a damn whether 'industry' likes it or not. Thank you for serving the public good.

D,Blake,,,OR,"I am in favor of passing the Cleaner Air Oregon rules because, although they are not perfect, they begin the process toward stronger regulation that is needed to protect the health of all of Oregonâ€™s citizens. Requiring facilities to report their emissions yearly should be mandatory. Without data, no meaningful improvements can take place. As in most other states, these collection and analysis activities should be funded by air emission inventory fees paid by the emitters. (Usually somewhere between $50 and $100 per ton of regulated pollutants, depending on the overall fee target needed to support DEQ operations.)

However, after reading through the entire draft, it is my opinion that the proposed rules don't go far enough to ensure that adequate enforcement can occur. For example, allowing the DEQ director some discretion in letting polluters continue to exceed permitted amounts is paradoxical. As any school child knows, in order for rules to be fair and respected, they must be followed by everyone and everyone has to know that established, predetermined consequences will occur to everyone who does not comply. I believe that without both parts, many entities will try to find ways around the rules in order to â€œlevel the playing field.â€&#65533;

Additionally, there is not enough in the proposed rules to enable more serious follow-through on enforcing regulations. For example, American Petroleum Environmental Services had continued to avoid any meaningful consequences for their non-compliance for far longer than reasonable. These new rules do not go far enough in ensuring failure to comply will be swiftly and seriously dealt with.",
Leslie,Poston,leslie@leslieposton.com,,OR,"Recently, I purchased a home in North Portland, near Peninsula Park. The pollutants in the air are a palpable, odor-filled, asthma inducing presence most of the time. Between the major highway running through the area, just a block from our homes, to the large semi-trucks that travel down our residential streets when freeway traffic is bad, to the many industrial plants surrounding our neighborhood and the neighbors on Hayden Island, there is no day that does not reek of pollution and cause difficulty breathing.

I don't believe these proposed changes go far enough to stop pollution, nor do they acknowledge all of the different types of pollution being put into our air, nor do they impact the sources of the pollution deeply enough. They should include all polluters, new and existing, the ""acceptable"" level should be drastically lower, and more monitoring should be done in locations that are closer to the sources of pollution and the neighborhoods that impact.

In addition to making the regulations on industrial polluters and highway polluters more strict, creating (and enforcing) residential pollution curbs, such as banning field, backyard burns, and firepit burning, and requiring abatement devices on wood burning stoves, etc should be enforced.",
Dennis,Poklikuha,pokman2@earthlink.net,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

For 25 years I have been breathing the pollution from the Swan Island Daimler truck assembly plant, located just one half mile below my home.  
This plant must be held to the same standards that new industry is held to. I cannot, nor can my family, go outside when they are painting.
This industry has seriously impacted our neighborhood's quality of life, and it must clean up its act.  Daimler has always been very uncooperative in working with our community, and stiffer laws would hopefully force them to clean up our air.

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

Tara,Herivel,tara@heriveldefense.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I live in Kenton and have lived in N. Portland for many years.  I am very concerned about the air quality in Portland for all of us, most especially for my 4 year old who was born here and raised on Portland air.  I was shocked to recently learn Portland has some of the worst air quality in the country, and am considering leaving if significant changes don't happen here soon.  We are better and care more than to let this be our, and our children's fates.  Here are some suggestions:

1. Draft Air Program Rules have been watered down and include significant alterations from the original program.  We want those alterations from the Cleaner Air Oregon program restored to the Draft Air Program Rule.

2. Most significantly for our neighborhood, we want existing facilities to be held to the same health standards as those proposed for new facilities.  Our neighborhood is strongly, make that horrifically, impacted by Daimlerâ€™s paint fumes.  More significantly, it appears Daimler uses isocyanate based paint products and does not treat their paint fumes to remove the isocyanates before venting them into our neighborhood.  Isocyanate paints cause cancer and are neurotoxic.

3. We live in a neighborhood surrounded by old existing facilities that pollute our air from the tank farms across the Willamette River to Malarkey Roofing across Columbia Blvd.  Our neighborhood needs all existing facilities held to the same air quality rules as new facilities.

4. Its important to add personal experiences like personal history, problems, issues, or concerns that you have with air pollution in our neighborhood and the greater Portland air shed (do you get headaches, go inside to avoid odors, etc...).

Specifically related to nusiance since this is not addressed in CAO and this would be important to us regarding the current nusiance investigation with Daimler.

1. Nuisance implementation policy is not expressly addressed in CAO - it is important the CAO program support the current program to respond to nuisance complaints.

2. Nuisance odors from industry -while in and of themselves may not be toxic -  are often important indicators about the movement of toxic emissions from an industrial source into an adjacent residential neighborhood. 

Let's rise above together and work for change for the people, not big business.  thank you.

Steve,Anderson,andersonriskanalysis@comcast.net,Clean Air Oregon Committee Member,Oregon,"Comments on DEQ Risk Action Level Flow Chart

First, as a Clean Air Oregon Committee Member, I want to say thank you to staff for all your hard work and efforts to bring this matter forward.

Per the Risk Action Flow Chart, I believe that the â€œExisting Facility Risk Action Levelsâ€&#65533; are too high and not protective of public health, specifically:

The Additional Requirements greater than 100 cancer risk and greater than 10 noncancer risk levels.

There is strong scientific evidence and regulatory policy to support not exceeding a cancer risk of 100 in 1 million and a noncancer Hazard Risk Index of 5.  I have offered verbal and written evidence to support this claim over the course of this process.  Anything greater will not be protective of public health.  DEQs goal to bring all existing facilities in Oregon below a cancer risk of 100 in 1 million and a noncancer Hazard Risk Index of 3 by 2030 further supports the above observation (comments) and I support this as good regulatory policy and protective of public health as well as a plan that moves us forward in a manner than does not incumber any one industry unfairly.

I strongly recommend the following that will be protective of public health and not deter from DEQs goal of cancer risk of 100 in 1 million and a noncancer Hazard Risk Index of 3 by 2030.

For Existing Facilities / Director Consultation Level:

Keep the cancer risk level at 100 and reduce the noncancer Hazard Risk Index from 10 to 5.

100 / 5

The noncancer Hazard Risk Index of 5 is an upper limit protective of public health and sensitive members of our population.

For Existing Facilities / No Permits Granted:

Reduce the cancer risk level from 500 to 200.

An upper cancer risk level of 500 in 1 million is not protective of public health.
It will result in Oregonâ€™s existing â€œgoodâ€&#65533; air quality to degrade to unacceptable levels.
There is not reasonable justification to allow a 100 to 500 range here.
The 500 in 1 million cancer upper limit is a 400 percent change over the 100 in 1 million cancer risk level.
There is no evidence that this range is needed by existing facilities, and if there is such a case, no cost benefit analysis to support the need for such a high upper limit here.

For Existing Facilities / No Permits Granted:

Reduce the noncancer Hazard Risk Index from 30 to 10.

This upper limit of 30 is not health protective, and there is evidence that at this level adverse public health impacts will occur, especially for vulnerable members of our population.
The 30 noncancer Health Risk Index is a 200 percent change over the 10 noncancer Health Risk Index.

200 / 10        This still offers an acceptable range for the Director to decide on a case-by-case basis.

It's at the point where we are moving out of Multnomah County. If protecting industry is more important to the state than protecting her citizens, then congratulations, you've certainly done that. 

I've never been so disappointed in a government. I've never felt more betrayed by a state that purports to respect her citizens. I was worried about the EPA under this administration. It never occurred to me that the state I live in would sell me out faster than Pruitt could ever do. 

I've written letters and gone to meetings. I feel like the representatives are only concerned with mitigating lawsuits. This organization literally makes me sick. ",

Joe Westersund,

I wholeheartedly support adopting Cleaner Air Oregon's health-based regulations to protect people and the environment from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules. 

Thank you.

Kannon,McAfee,kannonmcafee@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I am an Oregonian who is concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

Just last night as I walked home from my writers meeting at Anna Bannana's Cafe, I breathed putrid smelling air from riverside industry. 
While I understand bad smells are not necessarily toxic of themselves, they do indicate the reach of industry exhaust, which reaches across the whole of the North Portland Peninsula. I have breathed these fumes and worse across the entire length of the peninsula at various times since we have lived here.

I believe the Draft Air Program rules are too watered down from what has been proposed by citizens who live closest to some of Oregon's most active, most polluting industry. Please, restore the tighter standards of the Cleaner Air Oregon program.

Make people's health a higher priority than business as usual and the bottom line of industry. 

DEQ should strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

Hold existing polluters to the same public health standards as incoming new ones. This is especially important for those of us who live closest to these facilities. There should be no special exceptions of any kind given to Daimler, whose toxic paint fumes contain the neurotoxic carcinogen isocyanate.

DEQ should be constantly refining and improving nuisance reporting mechanisms.
 
Lastly, it is the responsibility of DEQ to engage community members for productive input and feedback, including providing accessible information, translation, and childcare services at community engagement events.

Penny,Meiners,endlesssummer02@gmail.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

Clear Air Oregon is indeed a ""visionary program that would set a national standard on air quality and environmental stewardship.""

1. The Draft Air Program Rules have been watered down and include significant alterations from the original Cleaner Air Oregon program.  We want those alterations from the Cleaner Air Oregon program restored to the Draft Air Program Rules. 

2. Most significantly for our neighborhood, we want Existing Facilities to be held to the same health standards as those proposed for new facilities.  Our University Park Neighborhood sits atop the bluff overlooking Swan Island. It is strongly, make that horrifically, impacted by Daimlerâ€™s paint fumes.  Not only are their paint fumes an ongoing nauseating and irritating nuisance, it appears Daimler uses isocyanate based paint products and does not treat the exhaust from their paint booths to remove the isocyanates before venting them into our neighborhood.  Isocyanate paints cause cancer and are neurotoxic.

3. We live in a neighborhood surrounded by old Existing Facilities that pollute our air from the tank farms across the Willamette River, to Daimlerâ€™s truck manufacturing plant, to Malarkey Roofing across Columbia Blvd, and many others in between.  Our neighborhood needs all Existing Facilities held to the same air quality rules as new facilities. 

4.  The argument that old Existing Facilities cannot afford to upgrade and will be forced out of business is nonsense. Vigor Industrial, which operates the shipyard down on Swan Island, hired a consulting firm to identify sources of air pollution from their facility and make recommendations for mitigating the identified problems. Vigor has implemented every recommendation and surprise surprise they are still in business. They are able to be both a good neighbor and provide solid middle income jobs in Portland area. 

5.  Lastly while Nuisance implementation policy was not expressly addressed in the Cleaner Air Oregon process, it is important that the proposed Air Program Rules support the current nuisance complaints process.   Nuisance odors from industry, while in and of themselves may not be toxic, they are often important indicators about the movement of toxic emissions from an industrial source into an adjacent residential neighborhood.

I live in the neighborhood poisoned by the two oil re-refiners in North Portland. For many years, we've been periodically choked by heavy bombardments of toxic, stinky fumes burned off by their processing. They deliberately sabotaged equipment mandated to scrub some of the pollution out of their emissions. The DEQ or the EPA has also found these criminals are also harboring PCBs in direct violation of federal law. Our health, our lives, and our properties are being sold out so these ruthless people can make a buck. Your constituents have begged and pleaded with the DEQ for years, but unfortunately, the DEQ will not crack down on this illegality.

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. I live immediately west of Swan Island (a block in from the bluff) and have strong concerns about what sort of industrial emissions are being released and then breathed by my family (and others in our neighborhood). It seems like there is little attempt to monitor air quality so that any illegal emissions can be pinpointed to the offending business.

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.

Rachel,Najjar,rasfrans@gmail.com,The Dalles Air Coalition,Oregon,"I appreciate the initiative of Cleaner Air Oregon, thank you.  But, if we're going to do it, let's do it right. Our health and our children's health cannot wait for industry to find a way to save money while investing in pollution controls.  We need industry to foot the bill, instead of Oregonians paying with their lives. We need zero emissions for every polluter or they shouldn't be in business. If they can not comply with your new high standards that will save lives, then they should be shut down until they can find a way to do so.  Excemptions that save industry money will be payed for with lives. Iâ€™m especially talking about used oil being burned to create a new source and absolutely no more exemptions for creosote! This is not a game, this is Oregonian's lives that are at stake.  The lack of regulation right now is not working for anyone and if we want to keep this the beautiful home that we have been gifted with, then you need to step up and create a way that you are the boss to polluters, not the other way around.  The guidelines should apply to every business in the state and should be effective immediately, not just the top 80 polluters and not within a span of five years.  How many people will suffer or die within that time due to the preventable cause of air pollution?  Due to the fact that information obtained from industry by the DEQ has in the past been an estimate or is self-reported by the business, the data that will be used to determine the top 80 polluters will not be even remotely accurate.  Amerities/Tronox/Union Pacific is an ACTIVE SUPERFUND site in The Dalles and we have been told that it is not guarenteed that they will be on the list.  How does that make any sense? The EPA has determined that Amerities is one of the most hazardous sites in America and is a threat to the environment and the health of the community.  Shouldn't this be the number one priority for DEQ right now?  I beg you to create these regulations with the highest consciousness for your community.

Eric,Durrin,ericdurrin@bullseyeglass.com,"Bullseye Glass Company, Inc.",Oregon,"Bullseye Glass welcomes clear, tough state environmental protection regulation that is fair and evenly applied to all businesses in a non-discriminatory manner.

Bullseye Glass Company (Bullseye) hereby submits the following comments regarding the proposed Cleaner Air Oregon (CAO) rules.  Bullseye has been closely following the rulemaking process and we appreciate the opportunity to provide input toward the goal of achieving a protective and workable rule.  Bullseye Glass asks DEQ to consider the following comments: 
 
Comment No. 1
The proposed CAO rules define â€œReconstructionâ€&#65533; as the â€œreplacement of components of an existing source to such an extent that the fixed capital costs of the new components exceed 50% of the fixed capital costs that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new source.â€&#65533;   OAR 340-245-0020(42).   Under the proposed CAO rules, an existing source, upon reconstruction, becomes a new source.  OAR 340-245-0030(6).  The proposed CAO rules do not specify whether â€œreconstructionâ€&#65533; is evaluated on a per project basis or could occur overtime as multiple components (or the same component) of the source is replaced.
The proposed CAO rules revise and incorporate the Colored Art Glass Manufacturing (CAGM) rules (OAR 340-244-9000 through 340-244-9090).  Bullseye requests that DEQ clarify under the revised CAGM rules that re-bricking is not considered â€œreconstructionâ€&#65533; for purposes of the CAO rules and a re-bricked furnace would not be considered a new or modified toxics emissions unit.
 
Comment No. 2
The proposed CAO rules define â€œRisk limitâ€&#65533; as a â€œlimit in a permit or permit attachment that serves to limit the risk from a source or part of a source.  Such limits may include, but are not limited to, limits on risk from the source or part of a source, limits on emissions of one or more air toxics, limits on emissions from one or more TEUs, or limits on source operation.â€&#65533;
Bullseye requests that DEQ revise the definition to include â€œlimits on raw material usage.â€&#65533;  In addition, where the term â€œrisk limitâ€&#65533; is used under OAR 340-245-0080, DEQ should ensure that the term â€œriskâ€&#65533; is capitalized consistent with the definition.  
Comment No. 3
The proposed CAO rules define residential and non-residential locations to include â€œareas that are zoned, or documented as planned to be zoned.â€&#65533;  Areas that are zoned residential but not contain residential structures should not be treated as â€œresidentialâ€&#65533; exposure locations because the underlying exposure assumption does not exist.  Further, the proposed CAO rules do not define the terms â€œdocumented as planned to be zonedâ€&#65533; or describe who makes that determination.  DEQ should not be, and has no authority, to make land-use determinations.  Further, many municipalities engage in long-range comprehensive planning including theoretical redevelopment of areas from commercial/industrial to residential and relocating commercial/industrial to other areas including currently residential zoned areas.  In completing a Source Risk Assessment under OAR 340-245-0080, sources should be evaluating actual, current exposures--not potential future exposures or what may be shown in a future comprehensive plan.  Only current, verifiable structures should be used to define and verify residential and non-residential locations.  Evaluating hypothetical receptors has no basis and will lead to highly exaggerated risk levels that mislead the public.
In addition, a source may own one or more residential units directly adjacent to its facility for use on a temporary basis for visiting management, employees or customers or may have purchased adjacent residential properties as a buffer.  Under the proposed CAO regulations, these properties would still be considered to be a residential exposure location because they are zoned residential.  These units should not qualify as a â€œresidential exposure locationsâ€&#65533; under the regulations.  Bullseye requests that DEQ clarify that any properties within the control of the source, with or without a structure, and regardless of zoning, should be excluded if the source has control of the occupation of the premises, regardless of zoning.
Comment No. 4
The proposed CAO rules allow a source to perform ambient air monitoring and use that information to supplement its risk assessment.  OAR 340-245-0080(1)(a)(F).   DEQ conducted extensive ambient air monitoring in southeast Portland and in other areas in Portland.  A source should be able to use DEQâ€™s extensive ambient air monitoring data in its risk assessment without following all of the OAR 340-245-0240 requirements.  Bullseye requests that DEQ include a new section under OAR 340-245-0080 that allows a source to use ambient air monitoring data previously collected by DEQ to supplement its risk assessment.

Regulating for health will spur technological innovation and economic development. Other states are already following more comprehensive regulations to protect public health. It's time for Oregon to step out of the Regulatory Dark Ages and adopt strong air quality protection rules.

Joe Westersund,

I wholeheartedly support adopting Cleaner Air Oregon's health-based regulations to protect people and the environment from the impacts of toxic industrial air pollution. I urge the State of Oregon to adopt strong rules that apply immediately to all facilities statewide and discard the old system of technological fixes. I support requiring reporting and public disclosure for 660 toxic chemicals from all commercial and industrial facilities that emit air toxics. As a precautionary measure, in case DEQ is unable or unwilling to enforce the rules, I want the rules to include a Citizen Enforcement Clause. Most importantly, the DEQ must set lower cancer risk benchmarks of no more than 50 cancers in 1 million and a non-cancer risk level Hazard Index of no greater than 1.

Rules recommended by EQC and DEQ will not cause Intel to move. Expect Intel to fight hard to reduce restrictions and expenses, but they WILL comply with stricter emissions rules so that they can operate their massive chip manufacturing plants.

Cheryl,Baker,cheryl.baker97217@gmail.com,,OR,"I live on Hayden Island in North Portland. The stench that we have to put up with is literally sickening, and the fact that the DEQ has not addressed this in a reasonable time period if truly disheartening. I am shocked at the lack of environmental rules/regulations/protections in a state that I had always assumed to be a leader in environmental issues.
- We deserve to know what we are breathing. It's not rocket science. Require monitors on industrial stacks, and conduct unscheduled, unannounced tests.
- Polluting industries needs to pay for their   past, present and future pollution, and they must be responsible for mitigating it.
- Our Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) needs to protect the public from being poisoned by businesses and industry taking advantage of lax regulations.
- Leaders in the DEQ and our Governor need to fight back against the Industry manipulated legislature and DO THEIR JOB, protecting the citizens of Oregon. 
- All neighborhoods in Oregon need the same protection from industrial air toxics as SE Portland (around the Bullseye glass factory).
- Industry is externalizing the costs of their manufacturing process on to Portland/Oregon residents and our health is suffering.
- Oregonâ€™s exemption loophole allowing oil refiners to use contaminated used oil as a fuel source for their boiler/burners MUST BE DELETED. 

PLEASE, DO THE RIGHT THING AND PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FROM INDUSTRIAL POLLUTERS! The Cleaner Air Oregon plan must be as comprehensive as possible, and not just provide meaningless lip service.",

Jennifer,Jones,thejonesfour@mac.com,Eastside Portland Air Coalition,Oregon,"I have spoken and written to you many times in support of cleaner air legislation, so today I thought Iâ€™d take a moment to share a different perspective. 

I am the daughter of the pulp and paper industry. My father worked his way up through Mills in northern California and Southern Oregon, finally culminating his career at Simpson in Eureka, CA and then his final years at Pope and Talbot outside of Brownsville, OR. 

I grew up in that culture and can still remember my dad coming home to tell me about the â€œspotted owlâ€&#65533; hunts where he and his fellow managers would traipse through the woods to prove they were not endangered. Or the speech he told me about the harmless waste water being disposed of in public waterways. I also remember the long talks about how important it was to clear cut harvestable land. I remember his talks with my well meaning environmental science teacher who asked him to consider the long term environmental and health impacts of the mill he maintained. My father maintained that without the pulp mill jobs our town would crumble. 

My father retired years ago now and for his retirement we gave him a plane flight over valley over their home in Brownsville. After that trip we sat down to talk about the experience and my father confided something to me that Iâ€™d never heard from him before. He told me of the regret he felt at not being a better steward of the bay when he knew that waste water was toxic. He explained that seeing the naked rivers and the negative impacts to them from clear cutting made him sick. And he told me that if he could go back he would worry less about where his paycheck was coming from and more about how his actions were shaping the world his grandchildren would inherent. 

I share this story with you in the hopes that you can see that sometimes when we are in the middle of something it can be hard to see all sides. I want you to know that our world will never lose if you prioritize the health of itsâ€™ citizens.

Steven,Shea,sheast@ohsu.edu,Oregon Health & Science University,Oregon,"The Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences writes in support of Cleaner Air Oregon.  We are a science-based institution with significant state funding located at the Marquam Hill campus of OHSU.  Our mission is to promote health, and prevent disease and disability among Oregon workers and their families.  We achieve this goal through basic and applied research, education and outreach. Our Institute performs research at many levels, including basic laboratory science, human laboratory science, workplace interventions and outreach plus education. Current areas of research include: occupational exposures, their adverse effects and prevention; treatment, recovery and prevention of workplace injuries; total worker health; and the effects of sleep and shiftwork on health, safety and productivity. The Institute also participates in doctoral and postdoctoral educational programs to train the next generation of scientists.

The environment has a profound impact on human health. The air we breathe, the food we eat, the quality of our sleep, our activity level, and the likelihood of succumbing to illness or injury are all affected by exposures that occur both inside and outside the workplace. Although workers are not included as a susceptible population (draft OAR 340-245-0100 (1)(g)), we are concerned that workers in businesses using and/or producing toxic chemicals are also at-risk because their exposures can exceed those of persons in neighboring communities. Thus, we ask that you consider including these workers in the susceptible population group. Regardless, reducing the toxicity and release of chemicals used in the workplace, the main goal of Cleaner Air Oregon, will be of benefit for at-risk Oregon workers.  
 
As noted, we are a science-based Institution and thus support taking a â€œscience-based approach to develop a consistent and transparent process for communicating and addressing the risk from industrial and commercial emissions of air toxics, providing regulatory predictability to businesses and â€¦ communities.â€&#65533;  Draft OAR 340-245-0005 (1)(c). This includes regular updating of the list of pollutants as new science is reported.  Draft OAR 340-245-0420 (1)(a). We recognize that DEQ will have many sources of information to use to assess science, including the scientific literature and regulations from other states, and has already established advisory committees to assess this information, including the Oregon Health Authority and the Air Toxics Science Advisory Committee. However, missing from the draft rules are mention of how often the scientific literature and other information sources should be assessed and guidance on how the assessments should take place. This latter point is particularly important because the assessing groups will be charged with deciding if chemicals should be added to the Air Toxics Reporting List (OAR 340-245-8020, Table 2), or perhaps removed, and/or if changes should be made to the Toxicity Reference Values for listed chemicals (OAR 340-245-8030, Table 3). We suggest the draft be modified to include specific guidance on how to make these decisions including the types of information sources that should be used.  

In conclusion, the Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences strongly supports Cleaner Air Oregon because it will improve the health of all citizens of Oregon including its approximately 1.5 million workers.

Megan,Chrisman,meganchrisman@oregonbusinessindustry.com,Oregon Business & Industry,Oregon,"Dear Mr. Westersund:

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Cleaner Air Oregon rulemaking.  Oregon Business & Industry (OBI) is that stateâ€™s largest, most comprehensive business association representing over 1,600 member businesses that employ over 330,000 employees.  Many of these businesses are manufacturers and are critical regional employers that will be impacted by the outcome of this rulemaking.  

Overall, OBI supports the Governorâ€™s goals of creating a predictable regulatory program capable of reducing air toxics and protecting public health without harming Oregonâ€™s economy and burdening our agencies.  Oregon businesses and manufacturers have long partnered with the state to dramatically reduce air contaminants from manufacturing facilities.  A success we should all be proud of and demonstrates that Oregon can simultaneously have clean air and a healthy economy through fair and reasonable air regulations.  

Unfortunately, the proposed rules do not fairly balance the needs of business, community, and good government.  Our members strongly support making the following changes to the proposed rule: 

â€¢	The excessive, overreaching regulatory standards must be revised. Notwithstanding industryâ€™s relatively small contribution to air pollution, DEQ has proposed a costly regulatory program that would do little to improve Oregonâ€™s air at a considerable cost to the state and individual businesses by unnecessarily imposing air toxics thresholds that are many times more stringent than similar programs in other states.  The costs to the state and its economy of using such stringent regulatory thresholds far outweigh any identifiable health benefits.

â€¢	Oregon businesses should not be regulated on the basis of emissions they donâ€™t emit, and concentrations at receptors that donâ€™t exist.  To derive toxicity, DEQâ€™s draft rule proposes to use hypothetical air emissions measured at hypothetical receptors, leading to gross overestimations of risk.  Not only should facilities be regulated on the basis of actual emissions measured at actual receptors, but facilities should be encouraged to use air monitoring as an alternative to imprecise modeling.

â€¢	Oregon businesses should not be penalized for the actions of their neighbors or for complying with land use laws. DEQ proposes to regulate businesses based on air emissions from their neighbors.  This puts businesses in the position of suffering increased regulation simply because they are located near each other in industrial zones as required by Oregonâ€™s land use law. 

â€¢	DEQâ€™s program should be based on likely health outcomes, not unrealistic assumptions about how people act. DEQ proposes to set standards under the assumption that one person may remain in a single location for 365 days a year over a period of 70 years. The assumption has no bearing in reality and drives highly restrictive regulatory standards. 

OBI members continue their commitment to invest in world-class pollution control devices that protect Oregonâ€™s greatest assets â€“ employees and communities. 

Please revisit the Cleaner Air Oregon regulations.  OBI supports the Oregonians for Fair Air Regulations coalition comments and incorporate those comments here by reference. We urge you to make the important changes that produce meaningful results without unnecessary and costly regulations.

Elizabeth,Henry,ashley@ashleyhenry.com,,OR,"When Oregonians do not have the information or means to protect our own health, it's time for our state to step up. Gov. Kate Brown's Cleaner Air Oregon initiative has the potential to prioritize the health of Oregon's citizens. Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality and Oregon Health Authority should take the input you have gathered from citizens rather than from industry, and draft a proposal for rules meaningfully and comprehensively addressing toxic air pollution from industrial sources.

The presumed premise is that, with the implementation of Cleaner Air Oregon, state regulators in Oregon will no longer turn a blind eye to toxics in our air. We will track these emissions, and also set rules to control them based on their impacts on human health. It's the right promise, but the devil is in the details. To deliver on their promise, you must place top priority on the health of Oregonians. If we're going to truly assess toxic air pollution, we have to look at all sources, new and old. And if we're going to truly base our standards on human health, we must use the strongest precautions in establishing the levels at which health risk spurs regulatory action.

What's more, the program must prioritize toxic reductions where people are most vulnerable. As for me, I have decent health insurance, a middle-class income and a job that allows me to catch up after I've fallen behind. When air quality is bad, I have the flexibility to seek refuge at the coast. But when I do, I often think of all the Oregonians who live in the most polluted areas and who don't have the luxury to escape it. It's high time Oregon took responsibility for addressing inequities and putting vulnerable communities first.

I strongly urge you to strengthen the rules in order to protect all Oregonians, and to put public health over profit.

To the Department of Environmental Quality:

The Woodlawn Neighborhood Association represents over 5,000 neighbors and 1,900 households in NE Portland. Our neighborhood extends from NE Martin Luther King Boulevard to NE 22nd Avenue, between NE Ainsworth to NE Columbia Boulevard. 
While mostly residential, Woodlawn has an industrial edge at our north, with heavy truck traffic on Lombard and Columbia, diesel freight train traffic, and other industrial uses. Our neighborhood school, Woodlawn School, at 7200 NE 11th, overlooks this area.  Nearly 75% of the students at this school are from communities of color and 44% are economically disadvantaged.

We urge you to support the best standards possible for clean air for our community, and to think of neighborhoods like ours when finalizing the rules for Cleaner Air Oregon. 

In particular:

â€¢For this program to protect our publicâ€™s health, especially the most vulnerable populations such as kids at Woodlawn School, the area cap program must include community sources like traffic and construction diesel emissions. 
â€¢Existing facilities should have the same health standards as proposed new facilities. Rules only impacting new facilities does not help neighborhoods such as ours that may have long established industrial uses nearby. 
â€¢It is your agencyâ€™s responsibility to bring the information to the community for their meaningful input and not vice versa. Public engagement must prioritize the areas most impacted by pollution, give advanced notice to community members, and ensure language translation where needed.

Laura,McLary,laurie.mclary@me.com,,Oregon,"Dear Cleaner Air Oregon Coordinator Joe Westersund,

I am an Oregonian who is significantly concerned about the negative impacts of air pollution upon the health of my community. 

For far too long, Oregonâ€™s regulations have been concerned with protecting the interests of industry and that has to change. Cleaner Air Oregon is a unique chance to lower those negative impacts and create a more sustainable future for future generations. I urge you to safeguard the health of community members over industry profits by prioritizing public health, strengthen consequences for violating regulations, and take into consideration all sources of pollution to guard against disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color.
 
Lastly, it is the responsibility of the agency to meaningfully engage community members and that includes providing accessible information, translation, and childcare services at community engagement opportunities and events.

And my own personal comment: I live into the Bluff above Swan Island and am very concerned about the dirty air that wafts up into our neighborhood, especially from the Daimler truck painting facility. This much more than a â€œnuisance odor.â€&#65533; We want to get the bottom of the nature of the chemicals that invade our neighborhood and applaud therefore the effort to create heakth-based standards for air quality, My daughter has lived all of her seventeen years in this neighborhood suffers from respiratory problems that are exacerbated by (and created by?) air pollution.

We in our neighborhood are so weary of having to be the watchdogs. This problem has been going on for YEARS. Now it is time for DEQ to have some teeth AND accountability to take care of industrial pollution. No more allowing/forcing DEQ into the back pocket of industry!
